## Changes made

- File E041_chatlog_w_usernames_dot_change.py
    - Based off of E041_chatlog_w_usernames_original.py
    - Changes: includes a dot filter to handle DoT Traffic, removes tcp.dstport from the bad_features to keep it from being removed.
    - Reason: Handles the accidental removal of tcp.dstport as bad feature and ensures all the DoT (inbound) traffic is captured.
    - Result: Runs without issues, and provides valid accuracy scores.
- File E041_chatlog_w_usernames_with_isp.py
    - Based off of E041_chatlog_w_usernames_dot_change.py
    - Changes: includes a isp filter to handle ISP Traffic. Uses Access_Resolver scope for analysis.
    - Reason: To include the ISP traffic in the analysis
    - Result: Runs without issues, and provides valid accuracy scores.
- File E041_chatlog_w_usernames_without_shadow.py
    - Based off of E041_chatlog_w_usernames_dot_change.py
    - Changes: removes the shadow traffic from the analysis. includes the chatlog from the new server log from gns3 rather than from shadow. This is done by changing the path it reads the logs from.
    - Reason: To remove the shadow traffic from the analysis and do the analysis of only gns3 traffic.
    - Result: Runs without issues, but results in a zero accuracy score.
- File E041_chatlog_w_usernames_without_shadow_with_isp.py
    - Based off of E041_chatlog_w_usernames_with_isp.py
    - changes: removes the shadow traffic from the analysis. includes the chatlog from the new server log from gns3 rather than from shadow. This is done by changing the path it reads the logs from. Also, uses Access_Resolver scope for analysis.
    - Reason: To remove the shadow traffic from the analysis and do the analysis of only gns3 traffic. Also, to include the ISP traffic in the analysis.
    - Result: Runs without issues, but results in a zero accuracy score.
- File E041_chatlog_w_usernames_dot_change_unscaled.py
    - Based off of E041_chatlog_w_usernames_dot_change.py
    - Changes: removes the scaling of the data. includes a new function called "adjust_time_without_scaling" in the scope class to handle the time adjustment without scaling.
    - Reason: to remove scaling because, we do not scale the entire network packets, but just speed up the frequency of the user sending the packets, which ideally should not change the analysis. (Not sure, was just a thought) 
    - Result: Runs without issues, but results in a zero accuracy score.
