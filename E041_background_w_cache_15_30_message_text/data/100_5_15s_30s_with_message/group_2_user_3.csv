I'm not.  I'm *almost* positive that this game will let you customize Link, and choose your gender, and I have no problem with that.  I have a problem with people acting so certain in something that has next to nothing to support it other than ""Link looks kinda girly.""  Yes, he always does.  That doesn't make him so certainly a girl like you seem to believe.

It's more that he *is* a vaguely defined person who you finish defining through your 'influence' as a player.  I think Nintendo is trying to expand a bit on that, here.  

Not that I'm saying you're wrong, or anything.  Link *never* was *only* who you are.  He's always been a courageous, righteous, kind person who does the right thing, regardless of the player, and in most modern games (mostly Wind Waker) he certainly has his own personality, though I feel its one that Nintendo feels most people would be able to relate to, to some degree.  So, not so much 'blank', as much as 'easily relatable and somewhat influence-able'."

The original video made me think that too, until I looked at the quality pictures.  So I can understand where you're coming from, but it was only for the split second that I originally saw it.  Looking at him now reminds me of Edward Elric more than anything else.

&gt;Which would seem strange in a Zelda Game

I agree, but Nintendo seems to be taking the whole Elder Scrolls open-world RPG approach to this game, and character customization is a staple of that type of game.  They also said they're 'rethinking the conventions', and that perfectly fits in with it.  It also makes more sense, from a business perspective, to let players choose, rather than alienating people who specifically want to play as either a male or female.  You want to play as a female, I personally don't care, and many want to play as boy Link as they always have.  It'd be most appealing to the largest amount of people if you could simply decide for yourself.  Wouldn't you be happier, if instead of being forced to play as a boy again, you could simply choose to be a girl?

&gt;Far and above more interesting than being able to customize your character.

Why?  What difference does it make if Link has male parts, or female parts?  It dictates nothing about the actual character, other than imaginary levels of testosterone.

To me, being female, or gender is general... is entirely irrelevant.  It truly changes nothing, unless they take a sexist approach and make the character stereotypically 'girly' and revolve elements around that.

That's why I think being able to pick your gender is so feasible.  It really doesn't matter whether Link(or whoever) is male or female.  It's purely aesthetic."
