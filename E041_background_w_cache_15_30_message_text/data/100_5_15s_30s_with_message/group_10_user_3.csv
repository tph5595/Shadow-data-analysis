I think your order is way over-complicated.  The flooded timeline is its own separate thing, designed to allow for a subset of games set in a different world.  There's no need or reason for it for it to be unflooded, and it's a bit much to suggest that something like the same Lon-Lon Ranch, or the Temple in this post, is still recognisable after the sudden flood at the end of WW when the protection collapses, then thousands of years of the water draining (?) etc. 

Whereas I don't see it as a particularly difficult leap that it's a different, non-flooded timeline where the Koroks changed form for some other reason.  They're obviously the same thing, just arrived at in two different ways. 

Might just be personal preference on what's easier to believe or not.

There's also one other assumption that a lot of people are making, and that's that the minimum 10,000 year gap that had to have been after a given title, which isn't the case at all.  The Guardians were only unearthed 100 years before BotW.  They'd only just recently been discovered.

I'm not saying it's the case, just that it's silly to rule it out, but 100 years before BotW could have been something like 80 years after OoT.  Really the only minimum time gap is that it can't be the same Princess Zelda, if you want to accept the idea that the Rito were always around but we just never encountered them.  Time enough to learn for the first time about the Guardians from 10,000 years ago.
