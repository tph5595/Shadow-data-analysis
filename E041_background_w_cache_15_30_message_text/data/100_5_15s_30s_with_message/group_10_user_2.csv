1682911397,102.0.0.62,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource10.html,"&gt;Yes, however there are two things. One, the Japanese version DOES say Twilight, and apparently it's the same word used for Twilight as Midna's title in Twilight Princess. 

Great, but that doesn't mean anything. The Twilight realm existed way before TP. Every single timeline would know about the Twilight Realm.

&gt;he other thing is that only Skyward Time and Twilight are mentioned in the sentence where Zelda is talking about people who used the Master sword. The later references ""the sea of time and distance"" and ""the golden power"" are a lot more vague (following the other references she should have said something with ""wind"" or ""waker"" and the ""golden power"" is a super common way to refer to the triforce) and aren't connected to a sentence about the Master Sword.

Apparently in the German, you can audibly hear her say something super specific to ALttP, literally something about ""a link to the past"" or something of that nature. Having trouble finding the sauce. And it couldn't be Child Timeline anyway, since the plaque by Zora Domain specifically references Princess Ruto as a sage helping the Hero of Time defeat Ganon. Link wasn't the Hero of Time in the child timeline(or at least remembered as such) and Ruto never became a sage. And it seems like a giant plaque in a series of others that tell the history of the Zora would be more credible than a passing reference to something that exists in all timelines."

That quote really needs context. It could just as easily mean that he was using TPHD as the base of ideas and game design for BotW. "
1682911398,102.0.0.62,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource10.html,"Only as far as graphics go. The game very obviously borrows TP's open-world and darker undertones. Plus, if he were talking about story, it makes more sense for him to have just referenced TP, not the remake specifically. Who knows, it'll be more clear if we find a source."
1682911399,102.0.0.62,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource10.html,"&gt;. Another couple of tidbits about the Zora monument. One, they don't refer to the Hero as ""The Hero of Time"" but rather the ""Hero of Legend"". They also say that there was a man who had ""designs on ruling the world"" in other words it implies that it's not the Ocarina of Time world where he succeeds.

Ok, but she still wouldn't be a sage or have helped a Hero of Anything. 

&gt;One final bit is that they could simply be referring to Child Link's actions in helping Zora's Domain in Ocarina of Time. They do draw attention to the fact that Ruto was he attendant of their patron deity.

Nope, he doesn't help anybody or get the stones when he goes back in time. The cutscenes shows them meeting for the first time again, and Hyrule Historia clarifies that it was, in fact, their first meeting, meaning he never got any spiritual stones, or even met Ruto.

&gt;PLUS Twilight Princess HD adding carvings depicting Rito, AND the Arbiter's Grounds appearing that, all together make me think the Child Timeline is the most likely.

The Rito Carvings in the remake sound more like an Easter egg, and less like an actual part of the story. Also, in Hyrule Historia, it says he was executed years after Link informs Zelda of Ganondorf's plan. Meaning, it's totally realistic to assume that the Arbiter's Grounds existed in OoT. It would certainly explain why it's in such a state of decay and disrepair, since TP is quite awhile after OoT."
1682911400,102.0.0.62,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource10.html,"&gt;Twilight Princess isn't open world at all.

Ahem. Allow me to rephrase. It's clear he took cues from TP as far as having a big world to roam around in goes. TP is by far the closest to BotW as far as world design goes, so there's no reason he couldn't be referring to that.

&gt;And I don't mean graphics no. Skyward Sword is clearly a test for BOTW's mechanics. The stamina metre, Hero Mode with its not dropping hearts. The sailcloth was even in early versions. The way you catch bugs, the crafting of items and potions in general. BOTW is mechanically very similar to Skyward Sword, despite being structurally nothing like it.

No reason he couldn't have taken cues from SS well. Not to mention that the only thing that you mentioned that is specific to Skyward Sword is the stamina meter. Hero Mode is like that in WW too, IIRC. Bug catching is in TP. Crafting and cooking are very different from SS and not a novel concept; Aonuma admitted he also looked to Skyrim, Witcher 3, and GTA 5 for reference. So really, even the stamina meter could've been borrowed from Skyrim or some such game originally, even in SS.

"
1682911401,102.0.0.62,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource10.html,"&gt;TP had 24 bugs to catch for a specific reward, BOTW has catching bugs specifically for crafting potions, just like in Skyward Sword.

It was implemented differently, but it wasn't a novel idea. Also, Skyrim.

&gt;The stamina gauge works just like in Skyward Sword, not like in Skyrim or any other game off the top of my head.

Running and other strenuous actions taking up stamina? That's an idea from *long* before Skyrim or SS.

&gt;Meanwhile, the HD port of TP certainly doesn't feel like the starting point of BOTW to me at all, UNLESS he meant lore.

I disagree, but I think that instead of arguing about game design, our efforts would be better used trying to find a source for the quote. Agreed?"
1682911401,102.0.0.62,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource10.html,"&gt;She wouldn't be the awakened as a sage int he downfall or child timelines, but BOTW CAN'T realistically be in the Adult timeline.

Seems like too big a piece of evidence to discount, IMO. There's nothing debatable about a big stone plaque practically saying that we're in adult timeline. Is it absolute proof that BotW is in adult timeline? No. But it's a good start.

&gt;I may be wrong about this, but wouldn't the problems child link solves still exist after that though? He'd have to go and help the zora and gorons again, or something. In fact that could tie into why there's a ""hero of legend"" rather than a ""hero of time"". Especially since the Hero's Shade clearly went on to fight more battles or SOMETHING, going by his armour and sword techniques.

Nope, when Zelda sent him back in time, he basically just meets her in her garden for the first time again, grabs the ocarina, and leaves. He never helps anybody else. Of course, he goes on to Termina, and then whatever he does after that, but as far as Hyrule is concerned, he never really existed.

&gt;It's just that TP s the only game where it's shown, so its continued existence is a a reference to that game, in the same way that if a game were to reference Labrynna explicitly that's sooner a reference to Oracle of Ages than it is a suggestion that it's Labrynna from another timeline.

Except that doesn't work here. In order for something to be used as evidence goes timeline, it'd have to be exclusive to that timeline. Arbiter's Grounds doesn't mean anything if all timelines have it.

&gt;Like, here's the thing. Since I really don't think t fits in the adult timeline, I have a much easier time assuming something happened with child link and ruto after the fact than something happening to fit in the Downfall timeline, that's all

Honestly, this is really fun, but I don't think it *really* fits in any timeline. Like, even if Aonuma came out and told us which one of the three timelines it is, none of the three make any real sense given all the conflicting evidence in the game. It's just a game of figuring out which timeline would have the least inconsistencies. A merged timeline is the only way to gloss over these inconsistencies, and I doubt that's what Aonuma is going to go with.
