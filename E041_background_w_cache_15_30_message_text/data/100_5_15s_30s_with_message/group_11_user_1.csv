1682911831,102.0.0.66,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource11.html,"I'm gonna try to give you some more concrete, but still spoiler-free advice:

* If you open your Adventure Log in the pause menu, you can select any one of your pending quests to be the ""active"" quest. This puts a beacon on your map and mini-map that you can follow. If you just got off the Great Plateau, then ""Seek Out Impa"" should be set as the active quest by default. Go east along the road, past the Dueling Peaks to the stable, then north along the road to Kakariko Village. But don't be afraid to deviate a bit from the path and check stuff out along the way.

* Enter and solve any shrine you see. The Old Man's tip about using your scope in a very high spot and marking any shrines you see on your map is a good one. Solving shrines and trading in Spirit Orbs (there's a goddess statue in every town, plus a few out in the world) is how you get stronger.

* Collect EVERYTHING. All those plants, all those bugs, lizards, and frogs, all those monster parts. All of it is useful; either it will let you upgrade armor later on, or if nothing else you can sell it for cash Rupees.

* You probably found at least one Korok on the Great Plateau; it is well worth it to search for more of them, for reasons that will become apparent on the way to Kakariko Village. Those little bastards are *everywhere*. The easiest ones to find are the rock circles with one rock missing (always the work of a Korok) and the ones on top of very high places. (If there's a building, mountain, or spire higher than everything else around it, chances are there's a Korok.)

* Cook food! Lots of it! Experiment! Early on when you have few hearts, roasting food items by holding them (find them in the pause menu and press X), then dropping them on a fire will do just fine. Shoot animals for meat, collect apples, acorns, and mushrooms, and roast them. There's no reason you should be hurting for recovery items. (I say roasting is fine early on because cooking doubles the number of hearts that food recovers, often resulting in dishes that recover several more hearts than you have, which is kind of a waste.)

* Satori Mountain, which is not too far northwest of the Great Plateau, has several groves of trees full of food: mushrooms, apples, hearty durians (which are awesome), herbs &amp; veggies.

* Don't be afraid of breaking your weapons. There are always more weapons. Always. Yes, even that one.

* If you're having trouble with fighting techniques, it might help to find a Bokoblin camp, save your game, and practice on them over and over.

Good luck! Let me know if any of my tips are unclear."

Weapon Connoisseur: There's a kid in Hateno Village who wants to see a series of ever more powerful weapons, with nicely scaling rewards for showing him each one.

There's a quest that gets you a really good horse, but I forget what it's called. You get it at one of the Central Region stables.

At (I think) the same stable is a guy who will buy Raw Gourmet Meat off you for 100 rupees a pop, which is a great way to raise money. The first time you talk to him triggers a quest, the first sale resolves it, but you can do this indefinitely.

MM takes place in a different realm, which may exist alongside Hyrule, may be an alternate world, or may even be entirely inside Link's head depending on how you interpret it. Maybe it's all in his head; maybe everyone just reminds him of people he met in OoT.

(Edited slightly to clarify.)"
