He does, however, say not to get hung up on how the character looks.

So I think the answer is still ambiguous, but this is indeed link."
1682911769,102.0.0.21,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource2.html,"Let's be clear; the other articles said that the character in the video wasn't Link based off of Aonuma saying ""No one explicitly said this was Link"".  They were wrong, as Aonuma turned around and is now saying it was in fact Link.

NOW the articles are claiming that Aonuma said that the character wasn't female.  Which is nowhere in anything they quoted.

Considering they were wrong the first time, I think I'm going to wait for more information before deciding that I'm wrong."
