Zelda games were always had different plots because of the curse and link and Zelda were always their respected genders.

Why is it soo important for you for Link to be female? The only reason why I don't like it is because I don't like it when they changed established characters just for the sake of change, if they wanted to do that create a new IP and character. I don't want to play tomb raider without lara croft of Metroid without samus. I don't want to play Devil May Cry without the Dante I come love and replaced with a rebooted version of him.

Shiek wasn't an established character and there was also no mention of her gender either and was a huge surprise when it turned out to be Zelda. We have never seen sheik again and probably never will, that was only for the plot of her hiding, same with pirate Zelda. 

Those two are very different then taking an iconic character and changing their gender for the hell of it. You wouldn't want Samus as a man would you? I sure as hell don't, we don't get enough badass women bounty hunters, shit now I want another metroid game. "

It's minor changes that isn't too big like turning Mario from carpenter to plumper. Not a big issue that piss off the fans. 

Changing him from male to female would be like the change Dante got from devil may cry and that iconic character was only been in the gaming industry for 13 years.   


Also people did complain about bond being blond, not sure about the whole black doctor thing, that's not even remotely the same, that's just being racist. "

The japanese love honor and respect and totally changing a gender from a character is total disrespect to the original creator without permission. They take that shit very seriously, look at what happned to megaman when his creator left capcom, we will probably never see him again because Capcom is pissed off at the original creator even though they hold the IP. Same with the creator of Dante from Devil may cry when he saw the new Dante, he really was pissed off in how they changed his character but DmC was created by a western team so they didn't give a fuck.

If the character is Zelda or a child of Link and not actually Link they they can kiss the SS reincarnation curse good bye and just not have either Zelda or Link in the games any more and just explore the world of hyrule with other characters. 

I rather they just made it a spin off game then Legend of Zelda, spin offs are good. Megaman and mario games had spin offs with different characters so why not Zelda? I would actually love to play a game as Impa and explore her story and peoples background. "
1682911301,102.0.0.35,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource5.html,"Just but all Links were the same, silent protagonist that are lazy in the beginning and begrudgedly or forced into heroics against their will. The only really difference between each Link is art style and hand placement of the sword and probably hair color. They're all white males that have pointy ears. 

Changing a gender is completely different from changing hair color or art style. Each reinvention of Link doesn't change his personality or major looks in any sort of way to think ""This isn't Link"". This is actually the first time anyone is **ACTUALLY** confused in who the hell that person was in the teaser because of his effeminate looks. 


If they want a female protagonist in a zelda game, fine, make a spin off. I would love to play as Impa and go more into her backstory and her people. "

Hell even the characters backgrounds can change but Link has always been constant and changing it now is stupid just to change him. He's still going to be a silent, lazy person who becomes heroic after being forced to, that is his character. 

I'm happy with change, look at what they're doing with Zelda U, it's fucking fantastic and I can't wait to hear more of it.

 Resident Evil characters were always the same characters, people didn't hate the characters but the gameplay for good reason. The game turned it's genre into something very different which is the reason people play the game in the first place, it went from survival horror to Action adventure game with some horror, it lost what made the series so good.

It's like changing Dark Souls into Devil May Cry with a lot of combos and super sayian mode that powers you hope and heals you at the same time. 


I want change in Zelda it was getting stale but changing the characters for the sake of changing them isn't where you begin. You begin with gameplay, environment, items, combat, how big you want the world and an interesting story. Loving finally seeing some advancement in technology in Zelda, it has long been needed. "
1682911302,102.0.0.35,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource5.html,"I'm just seeing since Link is such an established character in the Nintendo lineup it will be very difficult for them to drastically change him and Zelda.

Seeing her in SS and now Hyrule Warriors really makes me want to play her her for a whole action adventure game.  "

I'm not disliking female Link because I'm sexist but because that's not who Link is, it's the same as making Link a gerudo or a zoran/goron. It wouldn't make fucking sense at all and according to you he can be anything because of reincarnation. 

I wouldn't want a blond Bond either but they made it and I lived with it, still wish they hadn't and I also don't want a Male Samus or a Tomb Raider without Lara Croft. It won't be the same, some of that feeling that made the game Iconic would be gone. 

In my opinion gender bending any established Iconic character is a big nope for me, doesn't matter who the fuck it is. It's one thing of changing Bonds hair color but if they gender bended him you can sure as hell be sure people would be piss. Same with the Doctor, he clearly stated he doesn't want to regenerate as a women even though the Time Lords can. "

Gerudo braces just mean that he got them in a trade from them. Same reason why young link has Goron braces in OoT. Also Link was always good in horseback riding and marksmanship, that is one of the reasons why they let him wander around their fortress in OOT. "
1682911443,102.0.0.35,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource5.html,"&gt;Where is this rule written?

The Gerudo[1] are a recurring race in the The Legend of Zelda series. They are a reclusive tribe of thieves that consists entirely of women; however, every hundred years, a man who is destined to be their king is born. They have dark tanned skin, golden eyes and red hair. Gerudo warriors frequently wield glaive-like weapons and scimitars. They are known to have relations with Hylian men.

Meaning that they're consisted of women until the century child. They don't take in men in, only to mate with them. 

&gt;But his primary combat skill was always sword and shield. Where are his sword and shield in this clip?

If you look closely at the horses backback you will see the sword. This is just a teaser so of course they're not going to show everything. 

&gt;Exactly; if he earned their respect in previous games, why is it so farfetched that he would have some sort of connection to them in this game?



Because he hasn't earned their respect that we know of in this game. If he did then the only thing that is certain is that he's able to trade with them which would make the clothing thing there. 


Gerudo connection isn't silly, him being raised by one or being one is the silly part. He can trade with them, it's been shown in the past they trade with outsiders all the time except in Termina, they're just pirates that fuck 
shit up. 



Also a big hint why they never will take Link in is because of this little known fact of them
&gt;Those born into Gerudo society typically have little respect for the Hylian people, and the only men they ever truly revere are the males born into their tribe every hundred years. They usually seem to show distaste for Hyrulean culture, as in their eyes living in separate, wooden houses, worshipping Din, Nayru, and Farore, and having differing gender roles between men and women are all blasphemous.In Gerudo culture, the tribe is usually seen all living together."

You're trying to fit Link in with the Gerudos by forcing it and by not going what's already established with their culture.  If anything he bought the cloths in a shop that deal with Gerudo traders. It's probably going to be exactly like when you buy a Zora tunic or a Goron Tunic. 

&gt;where does it say that they absolutely would never raise an outsider as one of their own?  

Also I already posted why they won't in my last comment. The reason Link was taken care of by the Kokiri is because they had no idea he was Hylian, only the Deku tree did and he kept him hidden cause he felt great destiny from him. Gerudos won't give a fuck because they really don't like Hylians. "

They don't like Hylians, they wouldn't care for a boy child from Hylians. It's in their tradition, hell the first time Link sees them in Oot he's thrown in prison. 

Also like I said before the Kokiri had no idea he wasn't a Kokiri, they all thought he was one of them. The only person who knew he was Hylian was the Deku Tree, they don't even know who he is when he's an adult, they all thought he died when he left the forest because they thought he was like them. "

They could ensure he grew into a strong warrior which would be all the better to mate with in the future, and he would be one of them instead of being a complete stranger. They probably would want to bring a man in, especially one they could shape how they wanted.

No because Nintendo would never do that, that sounds very much like grooming which is closly related to pedophilila. 

&gt;The whole point is that Hylians were forbidden from the forest

No they weren't it was the Kokiri that were forbidden in leaving the forest. Hylians can come and go as they pleased which is why adult Skultos or w/e are in the forest, they're lost adult men and women.

Actually there is, Hylian male boy.

&gt; Use your fucking imagination; Gerudo thieves kill his parents, aren't heartless enough to abandon a helpless child, take him in and raise him, he earns their respect as he grows into a talented warrior. Just one of a million possible scenarios if you have even an ounce of creativity in your brain.

So they would kill his parents but raise the boy because they're not that ""heartless""....no that doesn't make any sense at all.

&gt;""One day, to escape from the fires of the war, a Hylian mother and her baby boy entered this forbidden forest.""

Because people go missing in that forest, not because the Deku Tree forbids it. There is a reason why it's called the Lost forest.

Changing a gender is completely different from changing hair color or art style. Each reinvention of Link doesn't change his personality or major looks in any sort of way to think ""This isn't Link"". This is actually the first time anyone is **ACTUALLY** confused in who the hell that person was in the teaser because of his effeminate looks.

I'm happy with change, look at what they're doing with Zelda U, it's fucking fantastic and I can't wait to hear more of it.

 Resident Evil characters were always the same characters, people didn't hate the characters but the gameplay for good reason. The game turned it's genre into something very different which is the reason people play the game in the first place, it went from survival horror to Action adventure game with some horror, it lost what made the series so good.

It's like changing Dark Souls into Devil May Cry with a lot of combos and super sayian mode that powers you hope and heals you at the same time. 


I want change in Zelda it was getting stale but changing the characters for the sake of changing them isn't where you begin.

I wouldn't want a blond Bond either but they made it and I lived with it, still wish they hadn't and I also don't want a Male Samus or a Tomb Raider without Lara Croft. It won't be the same, some of that feeling that made the game Iconic would be gone. 

In my opinion gender bending any established Iconic character is a big nope for me, doesn't matter who the fuck it is.

They have dark tanned skin, golden eyes and red hair. Gerudo warriors frequently wield glaive-like weapons and scimitars. They are known to have relations with Hylian men.

Meaning that they're consisted of women until the century child. They don't take in men in, only to mate with them.

If you look closely at the horses backback you will see the sword. This is just a teaser so of course they're not going to show everything. 

&gt;Exactly; if he earned their respect in previous games, why is it so farfetched that he would have some sort of connection to them in this game?



Because he hasn't earned their respect that we know of in this game. If he did then the only thing that is certain is that he's able to trade with them which would make the clothing thing there. 


Gerudo connection isn't silly, him being raised by one or being one is the silly part. He can trade with them, it's been shown in the past they trade with outsiders all the time except in Termina, they're just pirates that fuck 
shit up. 



Also a big hint why they never will take Link in is because of this little known fact of them
&gt;Those born into Gerudo society typically have little respect for the Hylian people, and the only men they ever truly revere are the males born into their tribe every hundred years. They usually seem to show distaste for Hyrulean culture, as in their eyes living in separate, wooden houses, worshipping Din, Nayru, and Farore, and having differing gender roles between men and women are all blasphemous.In Gerudo culture, the tribe is usually seen all living together."
1682911657,102.0.0.35,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource5.html,"So what you're saying is that Geruods aren't Gerudos anymore because time is different so their traditions doesn't matter anymore? 

You're trying to fit Link in with the Gerudos by forcing it and by not going what's already established with their culture.  If anything he bought the cloths in a shop that deal with Gerudo traders. It's probably going to be exactly like when you buy a Zora tunic or a Goron Tunic. 

&gt;where does it say that they absolutely would never raise an outsider as one of their own?  

Also I already posted why they won't in my last comment. The reason Link was taken care of by the Kokiri is because they had no idea he was Hylian, only the Deku tree did and he kept him hidden cause he felt great destiny from him. Gerudos won't give a fuck because they really don't like Hylians. "
1682911657,102.0.0.35,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource5.html,"Again you're not reading my whole comment.

They don't like Hylians, they wouldn't care for a boy child from Hylians. It's in their tradition, hell the first time Link sees them in Oot he's thrown in prison. 

Also like I said before the Kokiri had no idea he wasn't a Kokiri, they all thought he was one of them. The only person who knew he was Hylian was the Deku Tree, they don't even know who he is when he's an adult, they all thought he died when he left the forest because they thought he was like them. "
1682911657,102.0.0.35,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource5.html,"The Deku Tree broke the rules because he knew of his destiny. Also the Deku Tree doesn't have the same disrespect against the Hylians like the Gerudos do. 

&gt;You JUST link an excerpt saying that they are known to have relations with Hylian men... you're winning this argument for me against yourself

When did having sex =/= liking and love? They only go to Hylian men and other people because there's only women in the tribe. They need to repopulate somehow. Those men are dropped in a second when they're no longer needed. "
1682911658,102.0.0.35,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource5.html,"The Deku Tree didn't hate the Hylians, he feared for his Kokiri. He didn't want them to wander off outside the forest because he knew war was raging on and didn't want to put them in danger. 

Again he sense the density of Link when the mother came running into the forest. It pertained to his forest and people as well. Geurdos are a nomadic tribe, they would have just left the land for a new one if shit hit the fan. 

"
1682911658,102.0.0.35,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource5.html,"&gt;Besides, if they're going to mate with Hylian men, and Link being Hylian, wouldn't that make more sense to raise him as one of their own? They could ensure he grew into a strong warrior which would be all the better to mate with in the future, and he would be one of them instead of being a complete stranger. They probably would want to bring a man in, especially one they could shape how they wanted.

No because Nintendo would never do that, that sounds very much like grooming which is closly related to pedophilila. 

&gt;The whole point is that Hylians were forbidden from the forest

No they weren't it was the Kokiri that were forbidden in leaving the forest. Hylians can come and go as they pleased which is why adult Skultos or w/e are in the forest, they're lost adult men and women. 





"
1682911659,102.0.0.35,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource5.html,"&gt;there is absolutely nothing preventing the Gerudo from taking Link in as one of their own.

Actually there is, Hylian male boy.

&gt; Use your fucking imagination; Gerudo thieves kill his parents, aren't heartless enough to abandon a helpless child, take him in and raise him, he earns their respect as he grows into a talented warrior. Just one of a million possible scenarios if you have even an ounce of creativity in your brain.

So they would kill his parents but raise the boy because they're not that ""heartless""....no that doesn't make any sense at all.

&gt;""One day, to escape from the fires of the war, a Hylian mother and her baby boy entered this forbidden forest.""

Because people go missing in that forest, not because the Deku Tree forbids it. There is a reason why it's called the Lost forest.
