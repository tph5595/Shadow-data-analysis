This is like with Infamous second Son, we got Delsin and introduced to Fetch and her background, now they made a stand alone DLC to explore her more and her powers.

Male Samus = bad because we don't get enough female protags

Female Link = good because we want more female protags


You're right, Female protags should be in Zelda games that we should play so why not let us play with the badass Impa that we've seen recently. We already have a female character to to explore her background not only of her but her people that we closely known nothing about. "

1682911643,102.0.0.20,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource2.html,"And I'm saying why change the gender of one character just to make a female protag when you already have a great female character to explore. 

This is like with Infamous second Son, we got Delsin and introduced to Fetch and her background, now they made a stand alone DLC to explore her more and her powers. 

I have no problems with female protags but why change the main game instead of branching out the universe of Zelda with other characters."
