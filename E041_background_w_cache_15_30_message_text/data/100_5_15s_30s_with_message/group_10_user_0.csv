This bit of added art adds a NEW SPECIES to the timeline. It's SUPER blatant, and then they happen to bring back Rito in the next game.

And then you have this quote from Aunoma:

""When I look at this [Twilight Princess] remake, I feel like this is the origin point of the new title we’re making right now. After playing [Twilight Princess] you may have some ""Oh I see!"" moments when playing the new [Wii U] game, so I’ll be glad if you play 'Twilight Princess HD' while waiting in anticipation for the latest title of 'Legend of Zelda'.""

One, the Japanese version DOES say Twilight, and apparently it's the same word used for Twilight as Midna's title in Twilight Princess. The other thing is that only Skyward Time and Twilight are mentioned in the sentence where Zelda is talking about people who used the Master sword. The later references ""the sea of time and distance"" and ""the golden power"" are a lot more vague (following the other references she should have said something with ""wind"" or ""waker"" and the ""golden power"" is a super common way to refer to the triforce) and aren't connected to a sentence about the Master Sword.

EDIT: I've just been told the Japanese version doesn't have any references to Wind Waker even slightly, so that's that I guess
"
1682911394,102.0.0.60,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource10.html,"yeah, it's a big maybe for sure. I'd just argue that theEnglish version will holds more water than, say, the German version
"
1682911396,102.0.0.60,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource10.html,"Even if the Twilight Realm is a thing elsewhere, it's only relevant to the Master Sword in Twilight Princess, as far as we know. And Zelda is talking about the Master Sword's connection with heroes.

The German and Frenhc versions apparently mention Wind Waker stuff, and every language has a soft alttp reference in the form of ""the golden power""

However the Japanese version ONLY has the skyward, time and twilight references, and a very light alttp reference.

Now, the Ruto references suggest the Adult Timeline most easily, however BOTW really doesn't work as a Wind Waker sequel. The Zora aren't a thing in the Adult timeline, and they LEAVE Hyrule behind. A lot of stuff has to happen for that to work.

So from there you have to assume that Ruto awakens as a sage no matter what, or at least that it comes to pass in the Child or Downfall timelines. It's worth noting that there's a water sage in Twilight Princess, who Ganondorf kills, but it isn't replaced. Another couple of tidbits about the Zora monument. One, they don't refer to the Hero as ""The Hero of Time"" but rather the ""Hero of Legend"". They also say that there was a man who had ""designs on ruling the world"" in other words it implies that it's not the Ocarina of Time world where he succeeds.

Now there's a lot of weirdness in the Downfall timeline, but a big one is that a lot of Zora go feral, and there are no instances of the oracina of time styled Zora appearing. Additionally, the Downfall timeline requires that Link fail, or die, or something, so it's not very likely that Ruto, even if she awakened as a Sage, would be fighting alongside any Hero of Legend.

One final bit is that they could simply be referring to Child Link's actions in helping Zora's Domain in Ocarina of Time. They do draw attention to the fact that Ruto was he attendant of their patron deity.

It's the other timelines not really fitting, alongside the Twilight line, PLUS Twilight Princess HD adding carvings depicting Rito, AND the Arbiter's Grounds appearing that, all together make me think the Child Timeline is the most likely.

And I don't mean graphics no. Skyward Sword is clearly a test for BOTW's mechanics. The stamina metre, Hero Mode with its not dropping hearts. The sailcloth was even in early versions. The way you catch bugs, the crafting of items and potions in general. BOTW is mechanically very similar to Skyward Sword, despite being structurally nothing like it.

Anyways, that quote paired with the new stone carvings depicting Rito add some significance
"

I may be wrong about this, but wouldn't the problems child link solves still exist after that though? He'd have to go and help the zora and gorons again, or something. In fact that could tie into why there's a ""hero of legend"" rather than a ""hero of time"". Especially since the Hero's Shade clearly went on to fight more battles or SOMETHING, going by his armour and sword techniques.

Oh and obviously the Arbiter's Grounds exists in all the timelines, it seems silly to suggest they build a gaitn temple in the Gerudo Desert just to execute Ganondorf. It's just that TP s the only game where it's shown, so its continued existence is a a reference to that game, in the same way that if a game were to reference Labrynna explicitly that's sooner a reference to Oracle of Ages than it is a suggestion that it's Labrynna from another timeline

Like, here's the thing. Since I really don't think t fits in the adult timeline, I have a much easier time assuming something happened with child link and ruto after the fact than something happening to fit in the Downfall timeline, that's all

Skyward Sword introduced Hero Mode, it being added to later HD ports and ALBW doesn't change the fact that it originated in Skyward Sword. TP had 24 bugs to catch for a specific reward, BOTW has catching bugs specifically for crafting potions, just like in Skyward Sword. The stamina gauge works just like in Skyward Sword, not like in Skyrim or any other game off the top of my head. They even said in some interview that BOTW is the evolved form of Skyward Sword.

that can't be an accurate summary of the post ending events of OOT because Link needs to confirm what Ganondorf is planning so that he gets executed

Well we don't ACTUALLY know that Aribter's Grounds exists in the other timelines, that's an assumption, and I stand by that it makes a stronger case to be a reference to the game it originated from than another timeline where it's never referenced

it doesn't fit snugly into any timeline but frankly there are a million excuses that can be made to work around ANY of them. If Aunoma says one timeline or another then you just kinda have to assume stuff happened that makes it match up. Like if he says Child Timeline it means Ruto still becomes a sage, if he says Adult then at some point the Great Sea drains and they leaves New Hyrule to return to Old Hyrule, and all the missing races come back.

Some Wind Waker NPCs mention that the Great Sea is barren, there's a sugegstion that there's a curse on the water to prevent people from finding Old Hyrule, which Zora would be able to do easily. In BOTW Zora and Rito exist, so it pretty clearly shows that Rito and Zora can coexist.

The location of the master sword is LITERALLY irrelevant, it's where Zelda leaves it prior to the story starting.

But beyond any of this. BOTW CAN'T be in Wind Waker's timeline. The Master Sword is buried underwater, and they leave Hyrule.

Even then, Skyward Sword had an ancient sea. wind Waker's Great Sea is different.

This bit of added art adds a NEW SPECIES to the timeline. It's SUPER blatant, and then they happen to bring back Rito in the next game.

And then you have this quote from Aunoma:

""When I look at this [Twilight Princess] remake, I feel like this is the origin point of the new title we’re making right now. After playing [Twilight Princess] you may have some ""Oh I see!"" moments when playing the new [Wii U] game, so I’ll be glad if you play 'Twilight Princess HD' while waiting in anticipation for the latest title of 'Legend of Zelda'.""

One, the Japanese version DOES say Twilight, and apparently it's the same word used for Twilight as Midna's title in Twilight Princess. The other thing is that only Skyward Time and Twilight are mentioned in the sentence where Zelda is talking about people who used the Master sword. The later references ""the sea of time and distance"" and ""the golden power"" are a lot more vague (following the other references she should have said something with ""wind"" or ""waker"" and the ""golden power"" is a super common way to refer to the triforce) and aren't connected to a sentence about the Master Sword.

EDIT: I've just been told the Japanese version doesn't have any references to Wind Waker even slightly, so that's that I guess
"

"
1682911866,102.0.0.60,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource10.html,"Even if the Twilight Realm is a thing elsewhere, it's only relevant to the Master Sword in Twilight Princess, as far as we know. And Zelda is talking about the Master Sword's connection with heroes.

The German and Frenhc versions apparently mention Wind Waker stuff, and every language has a soft alttp reference in the form of ""the golden power""

However the Japanese version ONLY has the skyward, time and twilight references, and a very light alttp reference.

Now, the Ruto references suggest the Adult Timeline most easily, however BOTW really doesn't work as a Wind Waker sequel. The Zora aren't a thing in the Adult timeline, and they LEAVE Hyrule behind. A lot of stuff has to happen for that to work.

So from there you have to assume that Ruto awakens as a sage no matter what, or at least that it comes to pass in the Child or Downfall timelines. It's worth noting that there's a water sage in Twilight Princess, who Ganondorf kills, but it isn't replaced. Another couple of tidbits about the Zora monument. One, they don't refer to the Hero as ""The Hero of Time"" but rather the ""Hero of Legend"". They also say that there was a man who had ""designs on ruling the world"" in other words it implies that it's not the Ocarina of Time world where he succeeds.

Now there's a lot of weirdness in the Downfall timeline, but a big one is that a lot of Zora go feral, and there are no instances of the oracina of time styled Zora appearing. Additionally, the Downfall timeline requires that Link fail, or die, or something, so it's not very likely that Ruto, even if she awakened as a Sage, would be fighting alongside any Hero of Legend.

One final bit is that they could simply be referring to Child Link's actions in helping Zora's Domain in Ocarina of Time. They do draw attention to the fact that Ruto was he attendant of their patron deity.

It's the other timelines not really fitting, alongside the Twilight line, PLUS Twilight Princess HD adding carvings depicting Rito, AND the Arbiter's Grounds appearing that, all together make me think the Child Timeline is the most likely.

And I don't mean graphics no. Skyward Sword is clearly a test for BOTW's mechanics. The stamina metre, Hero Mode with its not dropping hearts. The sailcloth was even in early versions. The way you catch bugs, the crafting of items and potions in general. BOTW is mechanically very similar to Skyward Sword, despite being structurally nothing like it.

Anyways, that quote paired with the new stone carvings depicting Rito add some significance
"

I may be wrong about this, but wouldn't the problems child link solves still exist after that though? He'd have to go and help the zora and gorons again, or something. In fact that could tie into why there's a ""hero of legend"" rather than a ""hero of time"". Especially since the Hero's Shade clearly went on to fight more battles or SOMETHING, going by his armour and sword techniques.

Oh and obviously the Arbiter's Grounds exists in all the timelines, it seems silly to suggest they build a gaitn temple in the Gerudo Desert just to execute Ganondorf. It's just that TP s the only game where it's shown, so its continued existence is a a reference to that game, in the same way that if a game were to reference Labrynna explicitly that's sooner a reference to Oracle of Ages than it is a suggestion that it's Labrynna from another timeline

Like, here's the thing. Since I really don't think t fits in the adult timeline, I have a much easier time assuming something happened with child link and ruto after the fact than something happening to fit in the Downfall timeline, that's all

Skyward Sword introduced Hero Mode, it being added to later HD ports and ALBW doesn't change the fact that it originated in Skyward Sword. TP had 24 bugs to catch for a specific reward, BOTW has catching bugs specifically for crafting potions, just like in Skyward Sword. The stamina gauge works just like in Skyward Sword, not like in Skyrim or any other game off the top of my head. They even said in some interview that BOTW is the evolved form of Skyward Sword.

that can't be an accurate summary of the post ending events of OOT because Link needs to confirm what Ganondorf is planning so that he gets executed

Well we don't ACTUALLY know that Aribter's Grounds exists in the other timelines, that's an assumption, and I stand by that it makes a stronger case to be a reference to the game it originated from than another timeline where it's never referenced

it doesn't fit snugly into any timeline but frankly there are a million excuses that can be made to work around ANY of them. If Aunoma says one timeline or another then you just kinda have to assume stuff happened that makes it match up. Like if he says Child Timeline it means Ruto still becomes a sage, if he says Adult then at some point the Great Sea drains and they leaves New Hyrule to return to Old Hyrule, and all the missing races come back.

Some Wind Waker NPCs mention that the Great Sea is barren, there's a sugegstion that there's a curse on the water to prevent people from finding Old Hyrule, which Zora would be able to do easily. In BOTW Zora and Rito exist, so it pretty clearly shows that Rito and Zora can coexist.
