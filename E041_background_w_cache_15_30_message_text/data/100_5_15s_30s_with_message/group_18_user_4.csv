I just don't see the point. It's a fantasy universe. Our own ethnicities mean next to nothing in that cultural setting. In that context, changing race (removed from cultural meaning) is entirely superficial and feeling more attached to a character who is aesthetically similar to you becomes completely shallow imo.

&gt; while I don't think that you can't project onto an avatar who doesn't share your gender or race, it certainly helps for some reason, helps diversify the game, and for some people it really makes the game more accessible. 

I agree with this generally, but I just think in the case of a blank slate character like Link it is very much less the case. But yeah I can see the appeal in it. I just don't think it's worth it *unless* Nintendo is prepared to write slightly different dialogue/scenes for both sexes and not compromise any of their characters by resorting to bland gender-neutral writing.

Some people here seem to think this wouldn't be an issue but it's easy to think of characters within the Zelda universe who one might expected to treat a male or female link differently (nothing that would divert the course of the story but enough to change dialogue).

My problem here is that I don't feel that Nintendo would bother to put in the extra effort (but who knows, maybe I'm wrong, and that would be cool, and add some replayability for some people), and that it would take something away from their characters."
