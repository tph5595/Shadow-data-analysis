You're totally wrong on all three of your points...  I don't usually play 3DS on the go, I play it in my home, on the couch or something while the TV's on.

 How do you know that you wont be able to communicate with other people? Have you played the game yet? The online aspects of this game are enormous! You might even meet new people online! Who knows?!?!

Also the levels probably won't be too long because of the online commitment, which might be a gripe, but it's only speculation at this point...

3DS Mario RPG games. I know a lot of people who actually really enjoy them and look forward to getting the next one when they're announced! So, they're pretty happy about aht announcement.

Your love for Super Mario RPG 2 tells me you had a Super Nintendo growing up and that you're one of those nostalgic asshat gamers who hate Nintendo because they've changed since you were a kid in the 90's. 

Then, you go on to talk about Xenoblade X. Don't like a game? Insult it's audience! That's the intelligent and level headed thing to do!:D Something tells me  you probably still need more growing up there, sport!

What would you call Mario Maker then? Is it a mario game? Yes. Is it on console? Yes. So..... console mario game... cool.

Nintendo told us *eons* ago that they weren't gonna show any Wii U Zelda game footage because they delayed the game. The fact that you were not aware of this, doesn't mean they fucked up. That   means you were ill informed (a trend I'm beginning to really pick up here) Everyone knew except you apparently.

HAHAHAHA Steaming hot dump! THAT'S SO FUNNY. You sound like a 5th grader learning how to use dirty words in a sentence! Keep practicing, buddy:) As for the Metroid thing, i can see why some people would be disappointed, as it's a spin-off and not a true Metroid game. Looks pretty cool, but I can understand your disappointment.

""The graphics aren't good!!!!!!!!!"" is literally the stupidest excuse for disliking a game I've ever sen. WHO THE FUCK CARES THAT IT LOOKS LIKE GCN GRAPHICS?! Is it gonna be fun, you don't know yet. Does it look like it keeps in spirit with the star fox series? Yes. But you're such a shallow moron, all you care about is the graphics...

Sony was very lackluster in their conference, are you kidding?! They gave us Uncharted and................. uhhhhhhh Last Guardian? 3 years too late? A remake of a 10 year old game? No Man's Sky looked cool. Dreams was just a tiny teaser with no release date and we got 5 minutes of Uncharted gameplay. What E3 have you been watching?!

Microsoft did a lot better. The backwards compatibility was a great feature to add and mod support for Fallout 4 was cool too. But we didn't ""get **Motherfucking Fallout 4 and Doom**. Fallout 4 was announced two weeks ago. We got gameplay footage. WHICH IS WHAT NINTENDO GAVE US. Same with Doom.

Safe to say, you have no clue what you're talking about, you have the mindset of a 3rd grader and there really isn't any talking to you because your skull is too thick for any information to pass through it to your incredibly tiny brain."

1. How do you know it doesn't have a full story? Watch ALBW reveal trailer and tell me if you thought it had any story then

Looks pretty cool, but I can understand your disappointment.

""The graphics aren't good!!!!!!!!!"" is literally the stupidest excuse for disliking a game I've ever sen. WHO THE FUCK CARES THAT IT LOOKS LIKE GCN GRAPHICS?! Is it gonna be fun, you don't know yet. Does it look like it keeps in spirit with the star fox series? Yes. But you're such a shallow moron, all you care about is the graphics...

Sony was very lackluster in their conference, are you kidding?! They gave us Uncharted and................. uhhhhhhh Last Guardian? 3 years too late? A remake of a 10 year old game? No Man's Sky looked cool. Dreams was just a tiny teaser with no release date and we got 5 minutes of Uncharted gameplay. What E3 have you been watching?!

Microsoft did a lot better. The backwards compatibility was a great feature to add and mod support for Fallout 4 was cool too. But we didn't ""get **Motherfucking Fallout 4 and Doom**. Fallout 4 was announced two weeks ago. We got gameplay footage. WHICH IS WHAT NINTENDO GAVE US. Same with Doom.

Safe to say, you have no clue what you're talking about, you have the mindset of a 3rd grader and there really isn't any talking to you because your skull is too thick for any information to pass through it to your incredibly tiny brain."

I don't get it... we weren't even expecting this. This was a total surprise. It's not like they said ""Hey guys, new Zelda 3DS game this E3"" they just came out and gave it to us... That's pretty awesome. People need to stop complaining about a BONUS Zelda game..."

I couldn't care less about anything else, youre just so bad at not sounding like a whiny prick that I couldn't resist!"

1682911415,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"Okay

1. How do you know it doesn't have a full story? Watch ALBW reveal trailer and tell me if you thought it had any story then

2. Zelda is ALL ABOUT GIMICKS! Have you ever even played a Zelda game?

The clothing system in general is a very cool concept! Think about. Spending time unlocking an outfit with a certain perk to it, then replaying levels with that perk. It makes for a different experience every time you play, I think that's really cool!"

2. You're right, touch screen controls were totally necessary for Phantom Hourglass's story! Fashion consciousness plays in line with the new mechanic, so you backed yourself into a corner there. It will be canon. Just like four swords and FSA.

3. There is no such thing as serious Zelda. Anyone who thinks so is delusional."
