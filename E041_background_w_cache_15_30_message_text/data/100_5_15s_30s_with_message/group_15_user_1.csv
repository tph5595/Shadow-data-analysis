You're bound to find the majority of the shrine quests you might have missed.

Korok seed number is great, have you been spending them? Thats quite a few upgrades. Still, there's plenty left to find in the world, keep your eyes open for anything suspicious, 9 times out of 10 its a korok."

Mark down the locations of Talus' on your map and return after each blood moon and you will never ever have a problem with ore and have plenty extra to sell.

I didn't do this until way late in the game, upgraded my amiibo sets and I still had a bunch left over."
