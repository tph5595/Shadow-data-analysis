Your ""solution"" would mean that you maybe need to collect 5 weapons, but then you would be set. You would never again have to worry about finding weapons, you would be using the same weapons for the rest of the game, and you would be overpowered compared to most of the enemies.

The weapon durability system does a very simple thing. It evens you out against the competition in whatever area you are in. If you are entering an area where you are underpowered, you will soon find weapons that make you competetive. If you enter an area where you are overpowered, you can only slay things with impunity for so long before you have to start using weaker weapons.

This is a brilliant way of making a game where you can go anywhere you want, but still have a challenge.

On your last point, there is no ""money-sink"". As I have mentioned repeatedly here, you will never run out of weapons. If you fight against more difficult enemies, you get better weapons. If you fight against weaker enemies you will get worse weapons. You will never run out.
