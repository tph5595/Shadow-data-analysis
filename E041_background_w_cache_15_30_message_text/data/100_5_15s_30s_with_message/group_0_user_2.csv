If you've played the game with even a scrap of imagination, you'd see how much the game encourages varied playstyles. You don't like your weapons breaking? Find a way to sneak up on enemies and deal a ton of damage without using your weapons. Drop a metal block on their heads. Roll bombs down a hill until they're dead. Use an elixir and sneak up on them and kill them in their sleep. There's so many ways that BotW encourages players to be imaginative. 

This man is playing to find the flaws in this game rather than playing to find the joy in it. Why? Because a 7/10 on a game like grabs more attention than a 9/10.

Any time I come to a chest I think ""well shit, what am I gonna throw away this time?"" so eventually I decided to just use the weapons I have, even if they're super strong and rare. If they break, oh well. I can always get new weapons. And after fighting a monster camp, I always come out with more weapons than I started with. 

And I also understand the stamina complaint although I don't find the wheel to be ugly or it to be excruciatingly slow while not sprinting (and the game gives you several different modes of transportation other than jogging). There are food and elixir to replenish stamina when you're low and after you do a few upgrades, you really don't need them anymore. So I don't think it's detrimental to the gameplay.

The standard bokoblins and moblins are kind of boring to fight, but lizalfos aren't, wizrobes aren't, and any of the larger enemies aren't, like Lynels and mini bosses. And they do do more damage, but that's because they have better weapons and they are encouraging you to dodge or block their attacks, which the game teaches you about pretty much day 1. 

The biggest complaint that I have is that it's so hard to avoid the rain. If it's raining and you can't find an overhang to make a campfire at, you really are SoL.

Cooking isn't perfect but I don't have a huge problem with it. I wish it had an option to cook while looking at the pot, and didn't require you to pause and go into your inventory on your own, but whatever. And cooking 1 dish at a time is really the only way that cooking could work. How can you specify ""I want 5 apples cooked individually"" rather than ""I want 5 apples cooked all together in one dish"" without cooking everything one at a time?
