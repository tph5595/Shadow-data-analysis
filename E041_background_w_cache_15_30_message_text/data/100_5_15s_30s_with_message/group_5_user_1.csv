It's obvious that Zelda has always been the tipical knight saves princess, more obvious or less, but it would be weird to see a female link do all the knighting, and not from a role standpoint! But due to the fact that the franchise has been established as Link male Zelda female and that's the core. Changing that would break what makes a Zelda game for me: the motivations would be different, the interactions between characters, etc. I'm okay with them starting a new Ip or a new take on the series (imagine a steampunk Zelda game!) but not a game with the tipical hyrule like what we saw on the trailer, it wouldn't be the same."

Well, not necessarily: as a hero of time, he/she could come from the future and live in the past, but in /u/TedJustice theory there would be no Link, Zelda *or* Ganondorf, which could make things complicated in the overall-arch and in-game aswell. I'd like to see the ""before"" times, but as I said, traveling from the future (maybe grabbing weapons and getting help from the ancestors against an upcoming fight with Ganon?)"

&gt;they could use the game to show us more of the Zelda lore.

But the problem here is that you know how it's all going to end: the war is won by the *godess* not a hero, and it results in a phyrric victory that scaterrs and collapses civilizations.
