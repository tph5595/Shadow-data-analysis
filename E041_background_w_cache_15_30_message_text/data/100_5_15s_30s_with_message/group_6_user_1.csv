You see such a small portion of the map from that view that you have to get a general idea of where it's at first. I'll walk you through the Horse Statue as an example, in spoiler text so you can ignore it if you like:

[So you see the horse statute, and it's centered on a round stone. Around that is some grass, and then a path that wraps around it. Behind it, you see on the left some red, carved mountains; on the right you see a more typical lumpy mountain range. Those red mountains are the Gerudo mountains, and placing them on the left puts the Hebra mountains on the right. Those two mountains are on the left side of the map, so the horse is somewhere to the right of them. The castle is not in the image, so it's likely behind you - placing the horse statue somewhere west of the castle. So now you take the area between the triangle formed by the Hebra mountains, the Gerudo moutains, and the Castle, and examine that area for a round object with a path that wraps around it.](/spoiler)

For other images, you may have to look at things like the type of trees growing (different trees grow in different regions) or any large water features nearby, and then go to the area that makes sense and look around. There are a couple more memories that don't feature any such clues, but can be found by doing some of the other main quests or heavier sidequests."
