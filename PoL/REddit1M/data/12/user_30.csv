16024,That specific reviewer gave No Man's Sky a 9/10. It's a complete joke.
16121,"7/10 is very clearly a C grade in 2017, and EVERYONE knows this. Jim and Slant know exactly what they're doing when they rate the game 6/10 and 7/10. If they truly ""liked"" the game and were giving it a ""good"" score, they would give it a ""B"" grade of 8+. The only reason they say they ""like"" the game at all is so they can point to that line in their review and say ""Nuh uh, I totally LIKED the game, 7/10 is a FAIR score!"""

It's not like he made a ""scathing"" review that focused on real major flaws (since BotW doesn't actually have any), hell, he didn't even focus on performance issues which is like 99% of the complaints about BotW from almost every reviewer."

The nonlinearity of the game in which it allows you to go wherever you'd like is also a good thing for any open world game. Finally, the physics engine is quite advanced compared to any other game, and is the best implementation of such a thing in any open world. You can interact with the environment you're exploring in completely emergent gameplay. "
