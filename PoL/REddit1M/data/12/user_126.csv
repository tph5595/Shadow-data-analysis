In fact, I'd probably give it a 7.5 or an 8 out of 10 because of the issues that exist in this game. Seriously, fucking frame drops? I get it, the console isn't as powerful, but fucking frame drops are one of the WORST things you can get in a fucking game mate. The weapon durability system? How the fuck does my hammer of godlike doom break in one encounter against some scrubs? The hammer which you worked hard for breaks just as fast as that stick you picked up to use as a spear. 

I get it, we're suppose to use shit weapons for shit guys. I fucking get it. It doesn't mean it's a good mechanic. Let my fucking pro ass weapon have pro ass durability. It can still break, I'm chill with it, but fucking shit, let me fucking bash some skulls in before it just breaks.


Game's fun, it's great. Doesn't mean it's fucking free from shit that makes it really annoying.

EDIT: Framerate is VERY important for me as a PC player, so if any of you find that whatever, then obviously it's less important for you for your OWN score, ya shits. :/"
