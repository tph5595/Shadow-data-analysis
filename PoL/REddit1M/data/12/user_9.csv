6792,"I've been desperately looking for flaws and things to dislike about the game, as I believed it had been over-hyped..I figured it was likely a great game, but as usual with franchises like Zelda, it was simply getting a pass and soaring scores, because fans were willing to overlook the issues that would be a much bigger deal if it was, say a new IP. However, I'm close to 60 hours in at this point and still can't find much, if anything, to dislike. You really, *really* have to try to not like this game. As you said, he likely doesn't even truly believe it deserves a 7, but it's more grabby because the game is so good and getting so many higher scores."

Here's to hoping DLC will solve those issues."
