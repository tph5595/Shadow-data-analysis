23322,Sorry if it's been said but this takes it down to 97 on metacritic and out of the top 4 of all time. [That bstard ](http://www.metacritic.com/browse/games/score/metascore/all/all/filtered) 
46516,It's just interesting because every major games website reported about it being in the top 4 in the last few days.
96155,Um that's not my point at all. ðŸ˜¬ Just that it's interesting they spent time to say it's in top 4 and now that it's not all those written reports are incorrect. That was all ðŸ˜‹
96625,Nope. Are you ok? 
97026,"Yeah it is ðŸ˜Ž Don't just say I should be happy then because I didn't say I was upset that it's now not on metacritics top 4. I said ""That bstard"" jokingly. No fcks given ðŸ˜‡"
