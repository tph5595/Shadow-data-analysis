6058,"I've always been a huge fan of Jim Sterling. Love how much he fairly and objectively critisises all companies whenever they pull of some bull(DLC, Microtransactions, Youtube Copyright laws).

But this review rubbed me the wrong way. He's always been a bit contrarian but this review really makes me feel like he wanted to dislike the game, just to stir up controversy and get attention.

One thing I will say though is you can't call it clickbait, he runs an ad-free website. Arguing that he would do this for attention and controversy is fair though."

I can't confirm that he completed the game but he treats his reviews and coverage as if he's a traditional reviewer/critic not a Youtuber."
