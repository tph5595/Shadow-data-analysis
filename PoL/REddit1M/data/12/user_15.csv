8443,"I actually agree with some of the things he's saying. I get you can switch weapons out pretty easily but after 3 days of it I found it more monotonous than I found it interesting.

But it's all about opinion. I've been playing Zelda games since Gameboy and SNES and it's always been my favorite franchise. I bought a Switch (and a Wii U a few years back expecting a Zelda to come along) specifically for Zelda and... I stopped playing it after 3 days. I just don't find the game fun at all and if it wasn't for Odyssey coming out I'd be selling my Switch and Zelda while it's still hot.

Point is, while most people view this game as a 10 and don't find the changes that big of a deal, there are a few who just find it overly frustrating and not very fun. I thought it would be the Zelda I waited my whole life for and to me, it ended up being one I hate."
