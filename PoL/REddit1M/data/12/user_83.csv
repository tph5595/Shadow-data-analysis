""I believe the game is a 9-10. **Anyone who thinks less, has different taste than myself.** And their opinion, while just as valid, has no bearing on the game or my own views, and is thus a very pointless topic of discussion""

I haven't played BOW yet. But i fail to see how comparing games either validates or invalidates his review. It's just his opinion. All reviews are just opinions so what does it matter? By even suggesting the comparison you're only proving that you don't really understand what an opinion is, even though you litter your posts with the word"
