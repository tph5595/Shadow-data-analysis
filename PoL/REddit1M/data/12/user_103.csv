What people are responding to is his professional criticism being one, wrong about how the games systems work, and two, ignoring several features the game offers which resolve his issues. This isn't a matter of opinion – he is, to an extent, factually incorrect."

Again, the thing people are taking issue with is that he is objectively stating incorrect information about the game. There are features that alleviate some of the problems he states the game has, and he just didn't use them."

Shrines are marked on your map when you find them, and have different icons for discovered but not beaten, beaten but not completed and completed. You can also warp to them at any time, meaning that you can access any shrine you've visited and not completed in literal seconds.
The other one was that he said it doesn't allow for different approaches to combat. I can't really counter this with specific mechanics, but it's really a poor assessment of the game. Different weapon choices, stealth, sniping, environmental effects – there are a lot of different approaches to combat to the point where a lot of the time people I talk to have taken an approach I hadn't even considered.
Those are the two points I noticed."
