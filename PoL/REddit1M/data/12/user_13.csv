I really doubt it. And I doubt he put much time into this game. He isn't a reviewer, he's a YouTube personality who does reviews. His goal is to generate buzz and attention for himself, not report on and discuss video games. Most YouTuber ""gamers"" are these kinda of attention seeking narcissists. The fact that his review affected the Metacritic rating of the game makes him happier than anything could and I bet he's anticipating the social media backlash of it more than all of us anticipated the release of this game. I'd bet money he'll even do a video about how everyone of these biased Kool-aid drinking media shills all moblized against the righteous truth brought to you by Jim Sterling!"

Doesn't seem like it  

The review immediately starts off with him mentioning and being annoyed by the fact that the majority of reviews gave the game perfect scores. Not a great way to start off a supposedly unbiased review, don't you think?"
