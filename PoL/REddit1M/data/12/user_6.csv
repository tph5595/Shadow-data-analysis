Well Guardian music does tilt me but that's another story xD

Edit: To clarify since it's not very clear to most of you that this person clearly sacrifices honor and integrety to get his name out there and make money those 2 goals he achieved with this stunt.

Most of his 'fans' are like yeah he is the one doing the good in the industry it's funny you say that when someone is playing that deceive game on so many lvls and you are just ignorant to all the clear answers that are just there for grabs......

Millions and millions of views he has gotten in a few days and that's what someone like that does it for at the end of the run that's the one thing you can't deny, every single person who does youtube or whatever with very few exceptions.

Like that is not a mental health problem."
