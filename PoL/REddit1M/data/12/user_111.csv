71232,"&gt; But that totally read like he wanted to generate clicks on metacritic by being the outlier.

Neither his site or his videos has ads, why would he want to generate clicks?"

Sure, you can argue that by generating clicks on Metacritic he gets more attention and a bigger audience that might want to support him on Patreon. But it's also a big risk that people stop supporting him or that some people will not visit his site ever again."

Yeah.. Let's not bring hypothetical ""know facts"" to the debate..

I don't wanna sit and compare his reviews, but I think his score falls in line with his [Review Score Guide](http://www.thejimquisition.com/review-score-guide/):
&gt; ""Not the most glamorous, polished, or jawdropping, but most definitely good for a chuckle or two.""

That's pretty much what I read from his review. He had a good time with the game, just not as good as everyone else. And just because one thing brings down the score for one game doesn't mean it should bring it down for another. It just doesn't bug him as much in Witcher as in Zelda. I, for example, usally hate cutscenes, but I don't mind them that much in BOTW. 

All in all, there are no right or wrongs, game reviews are always opinionated. I for one am glad that someone brought the score down a notch, because the game is really good, just not THAT good."
