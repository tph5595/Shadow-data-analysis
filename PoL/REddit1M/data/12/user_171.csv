Weapon breaking is a punishment. You can avoid that punishment, but it's not a reward. The option is strictly worse, so that play style is discouraged.

A reward system for defeating enemies unconventionally is harder to do, shouldn'tâ€‹ be that hard for Nintendo, but has the same effect as the punishment except that player can do so of her own volition."

Many RPGs solve this by decreasing the amount and increasing the value, while BotW does the opposite in favor of promoting versatility, but that requires weapon durability to balance it out.

That being said this a case of the cure being worse than the disease. Throwing away weapons should occur outside of combat, as it is done typically when getting new ones. It is explicitly decided by the player when it will occur. Weapon Breaking is outside of player control.

Worse still is that according to you it stops being effective in the endgame."
