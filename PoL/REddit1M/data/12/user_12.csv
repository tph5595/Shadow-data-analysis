7979,"I love Jim Fucking Sterling Son, but I don't always value certain experiences like he does. He is a critic; he plays games constantly as a job. I understand that stuff like weapon durability and stamina is typically a low point in games, but not if it's done well and properly limits the player. I just think his trademark cynicism made him *want* to be upset at this kind of stuff. Doesn't change how I've always seen him, but I'm disappointed that such tiny things he didn't like made it so unenjoyable for him. "
