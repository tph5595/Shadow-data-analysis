17617,This man is smart. He knows giving BotW a 7/10 will draw more views and reactions than a 10/10 because he is being different. This is a smart business move on his part.

It's not as direct, may not generate the same level of income as having ads, but he will probably get a few people to look at some of his other material, will generate some subs on his YouTube, and that could very well lead to some more people visiting his patreon. "

Of course he is going to be hyper-critical of the game, that's his M.O. He's given very tough reviews on a number of very prominent games. All I'm saying is a 7/10 when the norm is 10/10 makes people check his out and sometimes his content and in a case or two he might get a patreon donation."
