There is none of this ""candle"" stuff to OoT. At this point in history OoT is being heavily carried by nostalgia. It IS still one of the greatest games of all time sure, but if that game was released right now it would just be mediocre.

I say this as somebody who fell in love with OoT and MM but they simply don't compare to BotW, how on earth could they? Video games don't age nearly as well as other mediums. At lot of the things that were revolutionary about OoT are just out dated now. Being able to change the way you swung your sword was awesome in OoT but in reality it barely makes any difference.
BotW is being judged on a completely different spectrum to OoT. The industry has evolved immeasurably since OoT's release. 

No one in their right mind can say BotW is anything less than a stellar game but that doesn't mean everyone has to love it. I personally didn't like Skyrim all that much but I'll be damned before I go and say the game is bad.

As a critic all you have to do is look at the base interactivity and interconnectivity the world houses to realise you're playing an absolute masterpiece of game design. It's truly astonishing that the development team for BotW was able to pack so much structured content into such open gameplay design.

BotW doesn't fall victim to many of the issues that have just become expected of its Open World genre. In all the gameplay that I've experienced myself and seen of others I've never seen unexpected errors in the physics engine or encountered wall clipping, something rife in other open world titles.

Hating on BotW at this point really is one of two things, nitpicking or attention seeking. Critical analysis is fine, but blatant statements about the game being bad is nothing more than an exhibition of ignorance."

Personally, I've found absolutely no issues with the weapon degradation system and feel as if a lot of complaints are simply coming from a misunderstanding of how the system should be used."

Perfect games don't exist as perfection is subjective. But games can still be considered masterpieces even if some people find some issues with it.

I really have no idea why you're getting so worked up about this."
199984,You keep defaulting back to that as if it's incorrect. What exactly is the issue with that statement?

I guess this is the end of the comment chain seeing as though we have nothing left to offer each other."
