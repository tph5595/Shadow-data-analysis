25287,"TBH the industry is willing to give perfect scores too easily because they very often give mediocre games 8-9 because they score well in graphics or sound design or controls but are generally meh. So I can respect someone judging games and realizing 7 is average and not bad instead of dishing out 8.5s.

That said, the amount of polish on the game and scope of it garners a minimum 8.5 by objective standards if you were to mark it like a rubric. As it turns out, reviews are bulls hit and there aren't really consistent qualifications among reviewers. It's just the opinion of someone to be read by people who generally share that person's opinion. I honestly think he's lashing back to the hype because he thinks it's overrated and didn't enjoy some aspects because it's not the type of game he usually likes."
