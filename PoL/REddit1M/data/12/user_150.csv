181418,"Its not about taking too much time, its about it being a constant intrusive feature if you're using the weapons. And I completely feel his pain every time I open a chest and its another weapon, because it means I just have to drop a weapon or leave it there. Those items being completely transient and breaking constantly are more of a distraction. I've been playing this as a combat heavy game and for those of you who think it would force me to think outside the box... it doesn't. "
181519,You haven't played dead rising have you... 
187481,"Its not a new system, but Dead Rising is designed around improvised weaponry, AND, creating them, threes a differently mentality with dead rising since you're not running around the map finding treasures and getting a weapon. You're running around the map and finding schematics. "
194110,"The weapon degradation is identical though, you run around, pick up weapons, kill zombies, the weapons break, you throw it at them. You go into stores to get more weapons. With dead rising four its similar but you have the addition of schematics. The system is just far less intrusive since you never find ""special weapons"" you build them. And its never intrusive since you can kill hundreds of zombies before it breaks, by then you've constructed a small arsenal  "
196441,"Its different thats the point, the durability works better in that game, but this isn't a unique feature. Its closer to the original dead rising where combining weapons didn't exist yet. 
I thought you mentioned something about the review so I was pointing out DR4 is quite a bit different. "
201582,"Zelda is just a barrier, Dead Rising is about improvised weaponry getting from point A-&gt;B under a time limit and fighting through hordes of zombies. An infinite chainsaw would actually trivialize that game, while a more powerful weapon in zelda would be slightly easier to kill low level mobs. For the most part combat hasn't been a huge part of the game, and really isn't that difficult unless your facing groups or really hard enemies. "
205656,"It doesn't trivialize anything because the vast majority of encounters are trivial to begin with. A permanent strong weapon I couldn't see making this game play radically different. Maybe temporary weapons + master sword is upgradable with no cool down is a good compromise. The weapons just create some tedious work sorting through weapons after each fight. To me it is a barrier, not all thing can be killed if you don't have the right equipment. "
206722,"I don't find the idea of combat trivial, just the combat itself isn't that difficult, and isn't posing a major threat on a regular bases, so having a guardian battleaxe ++ isn't exactly going to stop me from enjoying all of it. Its already easy mode for most of the game. The only exception is groups of enemies can be dangerous, but better armor makes these encounters trivial because they stop posing any threat."
207403,"See I think its the exact opposite, it adds a layer of forced item management that is intrusive most of the time."
208020,"Right but a pile of weapons isn't a constraint, its a clunky nuisance because every 10 that break I get 20 more. It would be like a survival game where you have your own caravan of supplies.
I understand the concept, but in practice its just like, your sword broke, your hammer broke, your leaf broke, your sword broke... "
208982,"Its busy work, it in no way makes for engaging survival mechanics when the game throws weapons at you non stop, and its a constant intrusion when they constantly break, notify you, and you have to switch or scramble to grab another weapon."
211080,"No, I'm saying if the survival mechanics are completely undermined by 2 tons of the items your supposed to be managing, and having more than enough to never worry about it at all, and not having to worry about means you can go about your business and not worry about different approaches. Not to mention not all survival mechanics work well in all cases. Like constantly rebuilding the same hammer in mine craft, thats not a compelling gameplay mechanic but people tolerate it for the rest of the game. It just forces you to sink more time into high level tasks. Zelda doesn't require you to fight very often, and its not a game that really needs to constrain a sword, but utility items work much better.

The best aspect about the combat is taking on a group of enemies, and what UTILITY weapons I have at my disposal, like arrows/magic wands. I don't really care what I have equipped otherwise. There is no reason to."
212016,"I've actually taken almost all encounters head on... And I have plenty of weapons, PLENTY of weapons.. 

They are as much incentives to get better diamond tools as working at mcdonalds to pay for college... I get the understanding but you're still putting the player on a repetitive path at remaking those items until they can find the proper material to make better items. Those are mechanics people are willing to tolerate, if you had a permanent hammer it wouldn't change the reason why people play it or effect their experience negatively of that game in any way.

To avoid breaking? They restrict on play styles... GENIOUS. Restrictions is a poor way of promoting different play styles. Especially when its soft restriction, it just turns intrusive. Like I mentioned about the difficulty generally being ramped up with more enemies, that actually promotes more play styles in an organic rewarding way. Combat being designed as a resource sink where the resources are plentiful just turns those weapons into transient non essential items you don't have to worry about. People have compared it to ammo in FPS games, sure, but its not a doom where the ammo has lots of varying utility, its more like COD where you have 700lbs of rifle ammo on your person."
213011,"What? No thats not how promoting different play styles work. I mean think of it, to promote different play styles, you restrict one? Thats a complete nonsense idea. No, you just make that 1 way harder to do without mixing other play styles in. No 1 way should be super effective. Again groups of enemies will do this this, incredibly tough enemies also. The melee weapons being resources doesn't really really do much.

I've been complaining about the system being intrusive... haven't you actually read my complaints? Not being effective at survival mechanics with plentify weapons, but I still constantly have to dump/pick after combat, and switch during combat. Not to any extent I feel like I have to think of it.

I mean I might not know tons about design mechanics, but I know when a mechanic is wasting time and I'm not at all engaged in it, its not effecting anything I do, and can separate it where the more complex game moments come into play. Are you a game designer?"
213723,"I mean i refuted all you're points for why it does anything for the game, its just a mechanic that is there, It leads you into thinking it matters but then your you have enough weapons to start a revolution it stops mattering... 

Just saying it does... I don't know, I don't see it, it hasn't stopped me from playing the way I want to play which is exactly what your saying it is supposed to accomplish. I rush in and kill almost everything with a club. The different weapon types have no effect over the combat style... I don't have any problems apart from playing it that way its become an intrusive mechanic with tedious tasks. "
214333,"I didn't contradict myself, the mechanic is intrusive to the play style you says its there to prevent. I don't feel it adds anything to the game, so constantly breaking weapons and picking more up is a waste of time and an annoyance. I've been trying to explain why the mechanic doesn't work the way you says it does. 
"
214981,"Grading is a poor comparison. You have to get a C or better in school because you're saying that you retained at least 70% of the information. You're comparing a system that requires more than half of the information you learned to be ""learned"" so it starts at 70% to 100% of competence of that information.

1-10 is evenly distrusted from 1 being so bad its just bad and more bad, to 10 where the game is legendary. 5 being... neutral. 7 is good. There is not ""failure"" point, just an opinion for terrible to amazing."
215586,"Reviews are subjective. Zelda scoring so highly is actually why gaming journalism is so bad these days, there isn't a diverse representation of opinions, and players like you have a misconception that reviews should be purely objective, Also, not saying you but I've seen it before, reviews should conform to a consensus. An honest review these days that isn't loaded with hype is hard to come by. 

There is a portion of mechanical competence that should be taking into review, but then there is the am I having fun? There are certain mechanics that he had issues with, and a lot of people agree with. "
216198,"I didn't say that, I said I treat all weapons as transient items. Like a box of shotgun shells. I take one out, I use it over someones face, it breaks, I take the next one out. The difference is I'm fully loaded. This is not like resident evil where I have to worry about my shotgun ammo.

You keep saying its part of a survival games, but you have yet to point out why it adds anything integral? Survival games are generally resource intensive so you really do have to consider what you're going to use. And the arrows and wands are highly good for that, but a pile of clubs/swords/spears are not, they vary a little differently but for the most part none are essential to keep because the game feeds them to you like your hansel and gretel.

You only pointed out theories also, none of which are working in practice. I'm pointing THAT out to you. In practice they constantly interrupt gameplay."
217718,"No, you are telling me theory of the gameplay design. I'm telling you that in practice that isn't reinforced strongly in the game.  I don't worry about using high level weapons. Because you won't just have boko shit. In practice the game poorly implements a resource mechanic and its overly intrusive. This happens all the time, developers think of a design but in practice can be proven unfun or clunky. 

Going back to what I said earlier, combat is only a small portion of this game, so having a stock of armaments is generally easier to come by then how often you expend those weapons. Especially later on when you get more durable weapons. You will only get shit weapons if you go back to early areas with shit weapons. First that sort of design discourages any sort of backtracking because you'll only be trading good resources for bad resources, second, the area you're in you'll never have a shortage of weapons for that area. Its unlike other survival sandbox games because there is a level of progression in the world. 

So again, I understand design, maybe you can tell me you're a developer? Just because resource management is a thing in survival games doesn't mean its implemented well. But that's what your suggesting. Any mechanic that is deemed a survival mechanic is instantly good if its in a survival game. One would assume you really don't think too deeply about how the mechanics are integrated in the overall design."
218998,"Oh man you've brought a lot to the table to explain why its implemented well. Apart from its a survival game and restating the same high level concept... you're completely missing context of the rest of the game, where and when it works well. And relating it to mine craft durability would be like comparing it to dead rising, the original which I adored. All 3 are different games, with different game play, and all 3 have integrated durability in different ways. The fact that you think I blatantly dislike all durability systems because I dislike minecraft as well... you forgot I was saying I liked how it was implemented in dead rising which kicked this conversation off...  I mean if you think minecraft and zelda are the same in implementation/integration, then I think you're understanding of game design is limited.

You can like the mechanic but that doesn't mean it cant be implemented better, less intrusive, more thoughtful ways. Or that there can't be some hideous flaws in the integration."
245663,"Neither do you... mr game designer. The fact that you have to resort to you don't know means you can't refute any of my points. They are valid criticisms of the system. 

Also this isn't a survival game, its an adventure game with survival elements. Its your opinion that its a good design. So tell me what is fun about a message popping up in battle constantly about your weapon about to break, or it breaking, and pausing the game to switch to another weapon if there are none on the ground. Tell me why the system works so well that its worth having those constant interruptions in the middle of fights.

Interruptions are objectively bad things, resource management when you have too many resources is a bad thing, it undermines the whole system. Imagine RE where you always had the maximum amount of ammo, and the choices are drop some ammo to pick more ammo up... whats the point?

Its like the difference between Dead Rising, and Dead Rising 4, on the surface level they share many of the same mechanics. But in practice they play entirely differently. DR 1 is a survival horror game with time limits to make it to certain events. DR4 trivializes the entire game because your never without 30 ways to kill all the zombies. Even with identical game mechanics, the way they structure the rest of the game, those mechanics change how those durability effects what your doing. Its also not nearly as intrusive in DR, they just break.

Why does games like DarkSouls which zelda is sort of aiming for have a different and again, less intrusive durability system... 

I'm pretty sure based on what you've said, you clearly don't understand game design or how tweaking a system can wildly change how it works."
252415,"First I didn't contradict myself, you are misunderstanding my argument. 

Second, the original dead rising game is closer to how zelda's implementation on durability than mine craft. And it wasn't a straight action game.  And even mine craft has wildly different game play since its a survival/craft game and the type of resources you collect completely change how the durability interacts with the overall design. Zelda is more of an action/adventure game with some survival mechanics. I mean just look at the combat in zelda and tell me the durability has the same effect as in minecraft. You'd be stupid to make that same conclusion.

Please explain how zelda, primarily an action adventure game, would be broken if it let you have a single sword? Because again, its not a ""survival"" game, you can teleport out of any situation, and there are some suvival elements with cooking, and some terrible survival elements with the weapon system. 

Any way this conversation is going nowhere, you clearly don't want to understand game design because it will hurt your precious view of zelda. Unless you can explain to me how constant interruptions during gameplay is ever a good mechanic... bye.

"
253820,"See, this is the problem I said durability system in dead rising is almost identical to zelda's.. I didn't say zelda is more like dead rising. Your struggling with basic concepts because you're ascribing different meaning to everything.

Let me describe a weapon system and you tell me what game its for.
You pick up weapons from the environment,
You have a limited bag space for weapons,
Weapons break after use,
You can throw weapons,
When your weapons break you have to switch to another or find one off the ground."
258675,"Yup resorting to grammar mistakes, when you can't argue against criticisms resort to petty issues.

The genre matters, but you fail to understand where zelda lies. Its not purely a survival game. Where are the hunger/thirst meters, where are the tool crafting, where is the building up of better more effective tools so you can make better use of your time. Those are core mechanics to survival games. Dead Rising / Zelda share more similarities than either to mine craft. They are both action/adventure games with survival elements in a sandbox. 

Yup but I don't know game design...
