Not every person is going to enjoy every game. And he's far from the only person to complain about the durability mechanic. But hey, now crazed Nintendo fanboys are DDOSing his website, so I guess a lot of people really can't tolerate dissenting opinions."

People are even going so far as to DDOS his website now, which is truly deranged. Sometimes, people disagree. Sometimes they even don't enjoy a piece of art as much as you do. That's OK. Roger Ebert trashed some of my favorite movies. He was still a great critic."

You have no idea what you're talking about. He's done game reviews for several respectable publications like Destructoid and The Escapist for years before starting his own site. Criticizing his opinion is one thing, but attacking him personally and saying his review is in bad faith is another."
43443,"&gt;The review immediately starts off with him mentioning and being annoyed by the fact that the majority of reviews gave the game perfect scores

Um, no it doesn't? Like, not at all? It doesn't mention that until the last paragraph, and it's not annoyance but confusion, he just says he wishes he could see it as a 10/10 game but there were too many things standing in the way for him. Did you even read the review? Seems like you just skimmed and then skipped to the last few sentences."
