7396,"Judging by his Horizon score, I'm guessing he just wanted to give a low review. I do agree with weapons, though. I feel there should be a repair system or more weapons that are indestructible in the late game. Or a way to make weapons indestructible, maybe through the great fairies."
16082,"Generally you don't start at a ten and work it down as you find things wrong with it. A game can still have issues and be a ten. His fo4 and horizon review both got 9.5, and would've gotten a lower score had he used the same formula he did here. The reality is that games won't ever be perfect. And can still be a ten.

So whether it is a ten for you is up to you, but I struggle to see it as a seven. And certainly it's the entire picture the determines a score and not graded like a school paper."
16385,"There's more to it than just waiting for a Zelda game. The response wouldn't be so overwhelmingly positive.

I've now put in almost 100 hours into it. It's the first Zelda game I will complete; windwaker was the only other one I enjoyed, but never managed to complete it. In general, they're not my jam, but this game is handedly making it into my top three favorite games. So how do I factor into the just waiting for Zelda crowd?"
16904,"Again, ten doesn't mean the game is perfect. I think that's what people get caught up on. It isn't a grading system (as in a search for errors). It's a measure how great they think something is. If it was a grading system, nothing would ever be a ten."
17058,"I mean, they can make it where you can salvage weapons. I'm at over 100 hours and there's certain weapons I never use cause I'm afraid to waste them. They end up just sitting there, ironically.

The weapons you get from your allies that have backstory? Nope, hung them on my wall."
17360,"I agree. He had an opinion. Screw what people's opinion on that opinion is. Can't a man post something directed at thousands of people and just have no one comment on it? Geez.

But seriously. If you make an opinion piece, people will and can and should respond."
17491,I get pathetically sentimental.
18068,"The problem is most definitely the users. The negative user for reviews on meta critic for example, are giving them game 0s and 3s and is the only reason it dropped down to a 7.5, which it deserves way more than.

Users think a ten is a perfect game. It doesn't mean that. It means the game was great, not perfect. But users have no idea what the scores mean, so backlash at the idea someone is calling the game perfect, when it isn't. When there is no game that is. All games with a ten score will have flaws. And they always will."
20230,"Cmon. You can tell they don't follow that guideline. Just look at their 9s and 10s.

They're professional reviewers. They know full well how the community responds to a seven. Heck, just look at the tone of the entire review. It was definitely salty.

Even if people hate it, it's the consumers who decide what a score means. This applies to words used in society as well; some curse words literal meaning are benign, but changed due to the way they were used in actual social situations."
22763,Think you might think too big of the sub Reddit if you think they had anything to do with the ddos.
23940,"Fair. My expectation has skewed the scoring system. But that doesn't change what I said. He can't give Horizon a 9.5 (massive according to the page you linked), and turn around and give Zelda a seven. It's a fantastic game, whether it's his cup of tea or not. If he critiqued this game like he did with others, they undoubtedly would have had a lower score.

If his tone and style was consistent and not so clearly weighted in agenda, I'd have less to say. If his own scoring system and way of critiquing was consistent, I'd have less to say.

With that said, I consider seven an average. Having played it, it's boggling to me to pin it as average. Just looking at his list and comparing it to other sevens just makes me confused."
25040,"I honestly agree with nearly all of his points. Except for maybe the blood moon bit. I just don't agree that turned it into a seven, while Horizon got a 9.5. With that in mind, it made it feel like he was out to give it a low score. To be different."
27392,"Hopefully it will be back up soon. Would be interested in your opinion.

He starts the review off with voicing his displeasure with all the high ratings it is getting. It ends up painting the mood and setting up his goal."
27435,Same with a lot of customer service stuff.

250378,"Then you must be frustrated that *any* game has a 10, because there is not a one without a flaw somewhere in there. Even on the Jimquisitions website, it specifically says a 10/10 does not mean the game itself is perfect and without flaws."
