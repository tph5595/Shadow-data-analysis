44653,"for me personally, I am always really weary when I read a ten out of ten review for a recent zelda game because it feels thats just the over excited reaction people have to a new zelda game even if that game won't be well remembered  and if no one ever gave a zelda anything less than a nine I wouldn't bother with series all together. "
45251,it's the same game regardless. I really can't imagine why a game getting a 98 or a 97 or a 82 should make any difference if its a game you enjoy. I'm sure jim sterling is glad you enjoyed the game
