23076,"Also the way he describes the weapons breaking problem, stamina and the clunkiness is pretty close to how i felt playing ...for about the first 30 minutes. I cant imagine finding those things obnoxious with a fully equipped Link, with durable weapons and items.

Eventually you get used to the controls, switching between weapons, etc (as you do in most games) and now I find the control scheme preferable to older 3d Zelda titles. Eventually you expand weapon slots and get high dmg durable weapons. And eventually you upgrade your stamina. 

It's all a progression of your character, so it seems unfair to write a review if you've stopped at the beginning. "
