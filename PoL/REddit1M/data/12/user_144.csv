162847,I enjoy Zelda and this game is definitely not a 9/10. The major dungeons were a letdown and the weapon durability issues are a hassle. I personally don't even get excited when I find a cool weapon because I know I'll have to fight some mini boss that breaks every rare weapon I have.
162904,The item switching and UI is clunky. You get used to it st some point. But it is clunky none the less.
162920,He finished the game before he wrote the review. Did you read it?
162987,"Cool, I lost my Thunderblade and got a... Club. Great trade."
163131,He beat the game. How much more gameplay did he need to put in to enjoy an annoying durability system?
163247,"Yeah, I think its funny that people think he's attacking Zelda when he hates Radio towers, tired survival mechanics and durability. He gave it exactly what I thought he would. He's tired of the Ubi-mechanics that Zelda borrowed liberally from."

Me personally, this game is an 8 tops. I don't see the 9-10. The dungeons, weapon durability and boss fights are a good chunk of the game that I have problems with. Also, every enemy 1 shotting you, regardless of upgrades doesn't make for a good difficulty. "
