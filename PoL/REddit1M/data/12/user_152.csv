When I read it, it felt like the same experience I had with the game. Everyone saying he just wants attention and isn't honest etc. is just biased imo. There really isn't anything wrong with the review, he even praises the game a lot. 7/10 is really good considering the amount of things he found annoying and tedious. Seriously people, just grow up and move on, you don't need everyone to agree with you to justify the fun you're having with a game."
