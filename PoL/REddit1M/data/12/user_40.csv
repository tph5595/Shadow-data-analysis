18734,"People are entitled to their opinion obviously. But that totally read like he wanted to generate clicks on metacritic by being the outlier. I could be wrong. But the whole ""you get painted in the corner"" bullshit sounds like he played for 5 minutes or flat out made shit up for clicks."
38712,"And that's fine. But a lot of his points aren't levied against other open world games. He says ""open world, closed doors"". One thing Zelda isn't lacking in is openness. You can do more in the first 5 hours than you could in 40 of Witcher 3. It just really seems like he just took all of every other review's positives and made them negative. 

""You can solve puzzles in multiple ways"" - Everyone else.

""The game forces you to open a door in only one way"" - Sterling. 

I don't get him. I'm still thinking he is in hopes people see it in metacritic and it generates clicks."
71468,"So he does all of this for free? Ads aren't required for site visitation to be profitable. I assume he's not doing this out of the love of reviewing games. I don't care about the score. I love the game. Scores don't change that. But reading his review makes me wonder how any game he has ever played scored above 7 to him. It really did read like he was nitpicking so he could justify a lower score for attention. If IGN or Polygon did this, everyone would go nuts. Sterling is suspect as well. It's FAR from unheard of to generate attention by being the outlier. "
75552,"He makes a living off being the outlier though. He's still a freelancer and exposure still helps him get gigs. But it doesn't matter. My issue isn't with the score. It's with a lot of his points. They seem to be purposely shortsighted. It reads like bait. He's known for being the opposite for being the opposites sake. He wrote a review based on negatives instead of a review based on the game as a whole. He tried to find things wrong and like any game, he found some. It wasn't a review saying the inventory system was clunky. It is but that wasn't the point of his review. It was more about how many things can he say are bad.

He writes for controversy. And that just doesn't sit well. 

""There is much in the design of Wild Hunt that frustrates on a consistent level, all of them minor grievances too numerous to ignore. The menus are cluttered and inconvenient to navigate. Movement controls can feel stodgy and imprecise when exploring, especially while riding the horse. I’ve come to truly despise Geralt’s equestrian associate Roach with a passion – it sometimes never comes when it’s called, it gets stuck on trees, it’ll stop for no reason, and it’s a burden to steer. Geralt himself can feel unresponsive at times, and is prone to freaking out when near certain terrain."" The Witcher 3

Yet it scored an 8.5. There are many things wrong with Witcher 3. But he scored it with the overall game in mind. And that's why I feel like it's just a bait article. 

""I see too many things getting in the way of the brilliance, too much repetitive busywork"" - Zelda

That sounds like Witcher 3 but he says it never feels repetitive. Apply oil, mash buttons, apply different oil, mash buttons, Igni/Aard, repeat. The side quests are brilliantly written but they are still ""go here and fight a Banshee"". Almost all points of interest lose their interest the 50th time. But for some reason he says they are positives. 

I just don't get it. "
