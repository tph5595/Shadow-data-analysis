65011,"I have no problem with a weapon durability system per se, I just find it a bit immersion-breaking that you can find a gigantic glowing axe that makes short work of enemies and it breaks after going through a couple of them. "
66148,"The durability isn't contextual - they don't just break if they are smashed against a suit of reinforced plate armor - they break when they hit unarmoured enemies. Claymores, axes, etc. don't break into tiny fragments when they hit flesh and bone. "
164120,"It's also funny because a lot of people who think the game is worth 10/10 also agree that some of the things like weapon durability are an issue, they just don't think it hampered their enjoyment of the game, so it's just a question of degree. Personally I actually quite enjoy scaling the towers, looking out at the world and then gliding off them and usually hate towers in other open-world games. I do think the weapon durability is poorly-implemented, though, and let's be real here - the boss fights and Divine Beast dungeons are not up to the usual Zelda series standard. 

It doesn't mean it's not a good or even great game to point these things out. "
165850,No it's immersion-breaking if the lightsaber battle axe breaks when you hit it against a fox.
