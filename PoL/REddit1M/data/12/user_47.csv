21062,"Jim Sterling was right on the money. Just another 7/10 Zelda game. Doesn't hold a *candle* to OoT. Currently playing master quest while my brothers play BoTW. It's just not a 10/10 game. At all. 120 sudoku puzzles is just lazy as fuck. Make 20 well-thought out dungeons. Oh well, that would be too hard. It's like a shitty GTA 5 game with no car and you're in the woods. "
