49373,"Reviews are almost never supposed to be ""just"" opinions. This is why there are professional reviewers. They don't have better opinions, they have more experience analyzing media and comparing it to other works. A game review doesn't say, ""this is how much I enjoyed the game,"" it says, ""this is how much I and people a reasonable number of sigmas away from the mean enjoyed/will enjoy this game.""

Of course the material for a review is largely experiential, but there are social forms that people share in common, and one can assume that in general, these forms evoke similar things. Upbeat music in a game gives feelings of joy or relaxation. Even if the reviewer does not personally experience this, they cannot deny that upbeat music causes these effects in general. That is, unless they critique upbeat music as a social form, beyond its particular usage, which is not what this reviewer is doing. A reviewer or critic, rather than merely offering an opinion, should analyze the work's purpose and effect by examining these social forms contained in the work itself. 

For example, the observation that the game forces everyone into a corner is not a personal experiential one, but a general claim about how the game works on different people. This is a factual claim, not just an opinion, and it's the kind of claim that a game reviewer should be making. However, it can also be wrong, because such a factual claim is rooted in the social forms contained within the game, i.e., how are battles laid out, how do enemies behave, what options do the players have, etc. I can say for certain that an enemy camp with a ledge good for sniping as well as a metal box for tossing encourages more variation in gameplay than a camp with just a metal box, even if I personally will take the box option for both. One could make the argument that the game is so unbalanced that a certain set of options is never favorable compared to others. But he does not make this argument and, in any case, it is not true.

The observation that shrines hinder exploration is, again, incorrect, because the reasons he gave indicate that he did not consider the mechanics of the game thoroughly. There actually are plenty of ways that the game resolves the issue he addressed. It's actually an interesting investigation in itself the subtle ways that the game does resolve this issue (just a short list: stamps, gliding, light rendering, color changes, shrine/reward trading ratio). Of course one could make the argument that these are simply not enough, but he does not. I think it would be a very difficult argument to make.

With regards to durability, he has more of a point, but he never stops to argue against the interlocutors that he acknowledges exist. He merely states that he has a different opinion, which is of course never enough in any debate. People who are in favor of weapon durability argue that it encourages variation in weapon usage. He argues that it discourages him from using more advanced weapons. But anyone who has played the game knows that these two arguments are not contradictory at all. There are shitty and good versions of every weapon type. All spears act the same, some just do more damage. Supporters will say that the system encourages usage of weapons that are qualitatively different-- he says that the system discourages usage of weapons that are quantitatively different. Qualitative and quantitative variations between weapons are distinct from each other. He never argues for one over the other, or that the game somehow hinders both. 

Obviously personal experiential arguments in support of this game will be favored by fans of this game, and that's not necessarily a good thing. It's unfortunate the critical arguments are treated more critically. Nevertheless, the criticality is a good thing. In this case, his analysis is simply shallow."
