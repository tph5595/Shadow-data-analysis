6329,"Honestly, he tried to draw attention to so many things that to me are just so trivial.  

He tried to act like a weapon breaking took hours of his time to switch to a new one, and made it sound so painstakingly clunky. In all reality it takes me about 2-3 seconds to switch to a new weapon.

Shrines he made it sound like were the most annoying thing.  
""The proper way of dealing with shrines is to complete them on sight lest lose track of them""
Apparently he never learned about stamps on the map.

I have too many friends/acquaintances who are just like this guy, and just constantly pick apart incredible pieces of work, just to be different.  I felt like I was reading a review written by one of them."
7768,Wait how can you tell from the map whether you've completed or just scanned it?  Is there another way to tell besides just stamping it?
8889,"Oh, nice! I usually just do them as soon as I get to them, but I had a friend who didn't realize about the marker and was upset he lost track of them.  I'll make sure to tell him that."

That being said, there's a difference between genuinely critiquing major issues of a game, and just being petty about silly things.

I just don't want people who never played it to get the wrong idea about the game just because a couple vocal people didn't like it.  I suppose the many 10/10 or 9/10 reviews will probably be the sellers though, and not the few who didn't like it Lol."
