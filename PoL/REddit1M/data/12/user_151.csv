182723,And yet he sucked HZD's dick dry. He was amazed himself that it worked so well for him.
182830,"So are you accusing him of dishonesty? 

Because if you are not, then your critique makes no sense, because he's not in control of his feelings and those problems he listed actually annoyed him.

And if you are, well, you're just being petty about silly things..."
183376,"But that's what the reviews are for. They are here to relay to you whether you'll like the game or not. 

He liked it well enough (7/10 being a good score), but not to the extent that some other people did (let's assume you're not accusing him of lying about his feelings, cause if you are, just fuck off). If I am a consumer whose tastes are aligned with his, then this review is of great value to me, because it tells me what my reaction to the game is going to be. If he was dishonest and gave it a 10/10 and I would go out and buy a whole new gaming system just for this game, I would think ""Wow, this is good, but nowhere near worth 400$ for me."" But if he is honest and tells me that he thinks it's a good game (FOR HIM), but not a must-own, then I will wait for a sale or play it later. 

This is the point of reviews. They are here to protect customers, not to validate your opinions."

Or that nobody would ever want a game to be more linear, because they would feel lost and bored in a world that does not give them any incentive to explore besides the act of exploration itself? 

Cause this is what the world objective means - it is independent of personal tastes and interests. So everyone would equally enjoy those features, regardless of who they are, which is simply not true. Many people would not care for the climbing mechanics, would not care for the non-linearity aspect of it (I personally love linear stories, I find them much more engaging). So how can those things be objectively good, if there are people that wouldn't like them?"
246649,"I have no idea what you're talking about. Can you give an example, cause you're just posting generic sentences and I can't argue with that."
272806,"For the shrines, he never said that you can't track them down. He meant that there is a shitload of them, so you will get overwhelmed and eventually never come back to them. That one is iffy, but I think he just didn't word it properly. It's like 1 sentence he never comes back to, but I'll concede that it's a bit meh.

I can't find the quote that says that you can't approach the combat differently though."
