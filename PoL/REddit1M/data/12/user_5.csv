6040,"Every time someone says something like this, people will say ""oh, you can't say that, everyone is entitled to their own opinion!"".However, it's time to stop and look, if every other reviewer is saying a game is a master piece and one or two think it's average, it's not good consumer advice to say it's average.

These websites would only give a game a lower score to a good game to generate clicks or because of the reviewer's personal opinions/agenda. If you can't separate your own opinions on a game to give an objective review, you're not a good reviewer, so why defend them.

When a review is complaining about the tutorial area being tutorial-ised, there is an issue."
7067,"I agree with you and understand reviews can't be 100% objective, but here they took clear prejudices into the review and let it bias their review. If a reviewer has these biases, they shouldn't be the one to review a game or should try and put them aside for the review. A review is consumer advice and should give a view based on what the majority of people would like if they were interested in the game.

This review had many critiques of open world, sandbox-esque games as a whole so it's clear the reviewer doesn't like this style of game. There is nothing wrong with this but, a good reviewer should make sure the bias doesn't affect the review."
8263,"Yeah, I think that is important to include in your review. However, this reviewer goes as far to say that ""mainstream features"" in it are an issue. If a feature is mainstream (inventory etc), most people will like it and so you can't criticise a game, especially in the conclusion when you dont. The inventory definately isn't handled perfectly in this game, but the review doesn't mention these ways, it simply says inventory management as a whole is bad."
