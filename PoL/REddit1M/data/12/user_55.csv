Excellent analysis good sir."
22781,People like you are the problem here. Video games are only allowed to be scored between 8 and 10. Anything less is clickbait bullshit and reserved only for the worst games of the worst.
22903,"Reviews don't exist to give people an idea of what other people think. Reviews exist to give people an idea of what an individual thinks. If I don't like a game, it gets a bad review. It doesn't matter if 900 other people gave it a 10/10.

Absolutely nonsense."
23013,"Pretty sure 5/10 is the average on every single scale.

If your scale is weighted from 8 to 10 only, your scale is worthless."
29945,"It's a global issue. People only rate things when they really like it or hate it on average, which is why things just have Like or Dislike nowadays. Same with how people rarely ever give positive ratings even though they really enjoy a product. The only time people take the time to review is when people are wanting to complain.

Makes reviews and ratings seem unreliable, huh?"
