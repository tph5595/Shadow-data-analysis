33198,"I have a lot of respect for Jim, but I respectfully and wholeheartedly disagree. I remember when dishonored 2 came out, and we over at /r/dishonored were a little upset when Jim gave the game a 5/10. In that case, I think we were upset for good reason. Many of the problems Jim had with the game either seemed to be demonstrably non existent, or were remedied by mechanics that Jim didn't seem to have knowledge of. 

With that being said, that does not seem to be the case with this review. Almost all of his issues with the game are actually issues, or are things that I can see people not liking (except for him saying there aren't enough ways to approach the game. No idea how he formed that opinion). For me personally, however, none if these issues limit my enjoyment of the game whatsoever. I'm sure there are many others here who feel the same.

For me, Dishonored 2 was a 9/10, and BOTW is a 10/10. Jim Sterling doesn't agree, but that doesn't mean his reviews are useless, and we should not bash him simply because he doesn't like the game as much as we do."
