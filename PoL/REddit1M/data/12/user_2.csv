4599,"It's this line that tells me everything I need to know about this reviewer: *Too many times does Breath of the Wild paint its players into corners rather than encourage “varied” playstyles.*

If you've played the game with even a scrap of imagination, you'd see how much the game encourages varied playstyles. You don't like your weapons breaking? Find a way to sneak up on enemies and deal a ton of damage without using your weapons. Drop a metal block on their heads. Roll bombs down a hill until they're dead. Use an elixir and sneak up on them and kill them in their sleep. There's so many ways that BotW encourages players to be imaginative. 

This man is playing to find the flaws in this game rather than playing to find the joy in it. Why? Because a 7/10 on a game like grabs more attention than a 9/10.

6780,"While I disagree with the weapon complaint, I do understand it. My theory is that I always  have more weapons than I need. Any time I come to a chest I think ""well shit, what am I gonna throw away this time?"" so eventually I decided to just use the weapons I have, even if they're super strong and rare. If they break, oh well. I can always get new weapons. And after fighting a monster camp, I always come out with more weapons than I started with. 

And I also understand the stamina complaint although I don't find the wheel to be ugly or it to be excruciatingly slow while not sprinting (and the game gives you several different modes of transportation other than jogging). There are food and elixir to replenish stamina when you're low and after you do a few upgrades, you really don't need them anymore. So I don't think it's detrimental to the gameplay.

The standard bokoblins and moblins are kind of boring to fight, but lizalfos aren't, wizrobes aren't, and any of the larger enemies aren't, like Lynels and mini bosses. And they do do more damage, but that's because they have better weapons and they are encouraging you to dodge or block their attacks, which the game teaches you about pretty much day 1. 

The biggest complaint that I have is that it's so hard to avoid the rain. If it's raining and you can't find an overhang to make a campfire at, you really are SoL. I was climbing some mountains the other day and it started raining and I just had to wait it out because I really couldn't progress any further without climbing, and I had gone so far that I didn't want to turn back. 

I'm fine if there are people out "
7116,"Yep. Weapons breaking isn't a big deal at all. If a weapon breaks, that means you're fighting an enemy. You know who has weapons that you can take? Enemies. And it takes 0 time at all there's a quick selection right on the D-pad for new weapons, shields, bows, and arrows. They don't even make you go into the pause screen. 

You don't even need to go into a shrine to have it be useful. Once you scan your slate on it, it shows up as a teleport point and shows up on the map. You don't get the spirit orb until you complete it, but even on the map you can tell if it's a shrine you've completed or merely scanned. 

The worst thing for a game critic is a great game. It's pretty clear to me that he was reaching for his criticism, and even the critique that he gave didn't warrant the score that he gave. "
7383,"I felt the same way. I saw a bunch of 10/10 reviews come in and I thought ""okay well maybe it's just the hype + Zelda. Is it really that revolutionary?"" I had seen gameplay and stuff and it looked like fun but I'm always wary when I see a lot of 10/10 reviews. 

But after playing for over a week now, I can confidently say that this is the best game that I've ever played. I like Zelda games but they're not the end all of video games IMO. I love Wind Waker and Twilight Princess but don't feel much for the older games. But this one is just a class above everything else. 

It doesn't do side quests as well as The Witcher 3, it doesn't have the largest map, it doesn't run at 60fps in 1080p, it doesn't have the best sword combat, but it's fun, exciting, and stimulates imagination like nothing else. "
7906,it shows an orange and blue marker opposed to just blue from a completed shrine 
9029,"Yeah I only realized when I got to one of those ""major tests of strength"" when I had like, 5 hearts and mostly crap weapons. 

"
10269,"That would have been nice. 

I'd even be happy if there was some weather god that we could pay to change the weather if we needed to. "
12164,"They're great, but they're very common so they can get repetitive "
12180,You can't make a fire in the rain though 
18673,"I strongly disagree. Not that TW3 has spectacular sword combat, but BotW has extremely basic sword combat. "
21056,"No, I don't believe it has the biggest map of any open world game "
21288,"I didn't say it has better combat over all, I said it has better sword combat. BotW has 1 button to swing, and if you jump while swinging you do something else, and if you hold swinging you get a power move. TW3 has quick moves or heavy moves, and the upgrade tree allows you to build on those skills and do some pretty cool stuff. 

I still think that BotW has better combat because you're given more options on what to do, but sword combat is still pretty basic. Not a bad thing, but it's not even as diverse at Twilight Princess which had unique learned combos. "
23537,Not when it's raining 
24212,"There are 3 different type. Spears, 1 handed swords, and 2 handed swords (axes, hammers, claymores, etc). I wouldn't say that's a vast selection. "
31555,That's not true. I read the whole thing. I disagree with the basis of his argument 
31608,Do you have any of those sources? Because I had thought I saw that there were several games with larger maps 
46402,"I think people should rate games based on their actual merits. Forget the title of the game, if it's a 10/10, then it's a 10/10. There have certainly been Zelda games that weren't 10/10s. Probably not even 7/10s. But the really minor nitpicking that Jim did in this review screams ""I'm edgy and Nintendo sucks."" His biggest complaints were the infinite weapons having weak durability and not starting with enough stamina. "
48505,What do you consider the combat in BotW if not a button masher? 
49214,"Is the exact same way in TW3. 1 on 1 you can get away with button mashing, but if you go into a group of drowners with no plan, you're fucked regardless of Quen. 

I'm not saying that BotW has bad combat, it's very enjoyable. But I think the swordplay in TW3 has more to offer. "
50310,I agree. Why not bring back some of those learned moves from TP? Those were great 
99362,I disagree that the weapon durability is a bad thing and I disagree that the stamina wheel is ugly or intrusive. Those were his 2 biggest complaints and I disagree with them.
105884,"I like to think that I'm not a very salty person. Anyway, from what I know about him and Nintendo, he has a bias against anything they do and will judge their work more harshly than the same game from another studio"
110240,because then he would get laughed out the door. 7 is low enough to garner attention but high enough to still be acceptable for a game of this caliber 
111350,"He's allowed to not like it, but I don't think his criticism was enough to push it down 3 points. I think I've made my arguments very clear "
169249,"The game doesn't anticipate players to have thousands and thousands of rupees on hand for the house. It doesn't expect people to be able to max their houses out in one interaction. It thinks you'll go away, get some money, sell some stuff, and come back every now and then. 

The great fairies do take a while and it is annoying. I do wish there was a more streamlined process for them. 

Cooking isn't perfect but I don't have a huge problem with it. I wish it had an option to cook while looking at the pot, and didn't require you to pause and go into your inventory on your own, but whatever. And cooking 1 dish at a time is really the only way that cooking could work. How can you specify ""I want 5 apples cooked individually"" rather than ""I want 5 apples cooked all together in one dish"" without cooking everything one at a time? It only takes a few minutes to cook a good amount of food so I don't think it's that big of a deal. 

Weapons breaking is only annoying for a moment because you have to pause your attack. Running out of weapons is never a real problem, even early on. There's always the next guys weapon for you to pick up, and no weapon is one of a kind. Everything resets after a blood moon (except for shrines). 

The menu isn't perfect and I do fumble with the controls a bit. I've noticed other people saying the same thing, although I don't think that the multiple pages is any worse than scrolling up or down. I think it's easier to lose track of what you have if everything is on one long page. 

The animations on the shrines can be skipped, and the koroks are just one line of dialogue and it's done. Not really an issue at all IMO. 

Yeah the rain sucks. There should be a way to change the weather, at least late game. "
