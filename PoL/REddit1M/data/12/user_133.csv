That's it. Its just like when Prometheus came out. Some people liked it a lot and admitted it had problems, me included, but those problems were little in comparison to its strengths in their eyes. Others disagreed and believed these flaws were too great to forgive. *And thats just fine.*"

Just one of those things that rubs him the wrong way. I don't like Saints Row because of its sticky physics. I can't help it, I loathe those physics. I like the game. I want to see whar others do, but I cannot get over the fact that leaping in a car over a hill does not result in the car skidding and sliding when you land. Like a car would. Everyone has pet peeves. This is Jim's.

And thats fine."
