10150,"&gt; The biggest complaint that I have is that it's so hard to avoid the rain. If it's raining and you can't find an overhang to make a campfire at, you really are SoL. I was climbing some mountains the other day and it started raining and I just had to wait it out because I really couldn't progress any further without climbing, and I had gone so far that I didn't want to turn back. 

The climbing gloves should have given improved grip on slippery surfaces imo
