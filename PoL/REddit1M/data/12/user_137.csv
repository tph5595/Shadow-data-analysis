Not really. Most reviewers have their own scale and there's nothing wrong with that as long as they make clear how their scale reflects their opinion.     
I would argue that aggregator sites like metacritic are pointless **because** of the aforementioned personal scale of every critic.    
    You can't simply average out ratings like that. To make it work, you'd need to normalise ratings before taking the average."
