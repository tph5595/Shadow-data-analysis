962060,While this is true the durability for end game weapons is still not high enough. I played for 75 hours and at the end I was only using the Hylian Shield + Master Sword because I was tired of finding weapons. Also I ran out of bows. The durability for bows is fucking stupid.
962255,"The actual content of the review is spot on. The score is not because it places Zelda into a bracket with other games that actually deserve those scores.

If OoT was a true 10, Skyrim would be a 6, Fallout 4 NV a 9 and BoTW an 8.5.

I loved this game. It started out amazingly and during the first 10-20 hours I thought I was playing the best game ever made. Unfortunately the last half left me wanting. I was waiting for things that never came.

This is just my opinion."
