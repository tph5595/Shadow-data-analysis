30438,"Counter-attack button prompts? I think you're thinking of a different game there. The Witcher 3 definitely had no counter prompts. That's not to say the sword combat was amazing or anything, because i think it was fairly average, but you're definitely misrepresenting it.

The skill tree customization also allowed for some really cool changes as well, it definitely wasn't just percentage increases to damage. Like the various ones that augmented potion/elixir uses, or various ones that allowed you to use your signs in different ways, or the 2 later on in the basic combat tree that gave you different fast and strong attacks.

It wasn't the best combat i've EVER had in a game, but I think TW3 had a fairly solid combat system overall."

If you're just talking about swordplay only, then sure it's extraordinarily meh. But the rest of it I think brings it up quite a bit."
