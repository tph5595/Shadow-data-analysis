By posting this video I don't intend to say that Zelda is better than Horizon, what I want is to show is that by no means Zelda is a 7 or less than a 8. Actually the effort put in the gameplay mechanics of this game are quite stunning. 

Besides, playing a game for less than 10 or 20 hours before reviewing it is a must. "
