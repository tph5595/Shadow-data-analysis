1) The four dungeons are really just big puzzle rooms with only two or three enemies at all in them, besides the boss. Now, to be fair, I ADORE the puzzles and love staring at a room trying to figure it out.

But I also miss the dungeon crawling part of the old dungeons in previous games.

On the other hand, the BOTW team basically turned the world map inside out and put the dungeon crawling on the world map. So the complaint is valid, but only barely.

2) Weapons DO break a little too easily, to the point where I have half my sword inventory occupied by weapons I think are too cool to use, lest I break them and lose them. But as I've progressed though the game, I'm amazed at how well it's progressed with me, despite it being so non-linear. 

I now have weapons ten-times as strong as what I started with, all by simply breaking and replacing my old ones. So it's annoying by nature, but ultimately a good thing. 

It's a valid criticism, but only barely.

3) The stamina wheel is initially too short, and it requires a lot of time and effort to upgrade it to the point where you're not constantly worried about it (roughly 2 full wheels).

But then again, I grew up on games like Castlevania, Mega Man and the original Zelda. Those were games that intentionally handicapped you for no reason other than ""challenge"" so I can appreciate it. 

I understand the frustrations with it. It's a valid point, but for me only barely one.

Those are three fair criticisms, but those aren't enough to warrant a 7/10, in my opinion. The overall experiences triumphs over the choices made and even the limitations of the design (slowdown and popup).

A few of his complaints are just nothingburgers. 

He's annoyed that the Shrines seem out of place. How are they?  They'd be out of place in a game like OOT where technology was basically non-existent, but it's all over this world.

He's annoyed that Amiibos are the only way to unlock cool stuff, and Amiibos are expensive. Yes, but that stuff is (A) entirely optional, (2) designed to reward people who are dedicated to the franchise with a BONUS, and (D) don't even include the best stuff you can get in the game, normally.

He's annoyed that same Entering a Shrine animation plays every time. Okay, so hit ""x"" (or ""b"") and skip it. When a game gives you the option to skip something you don't like, without any consequence, you can't complain about it. 

That's just bad manners.

Overall I think this review is fair but leans on the nit-picky side. I think the 7/10 score is laughable, though."

There's a whole mega thread about reviews so clearly a lot of people care.

I wrote 200+ words about why he score doesn't seem to match up to the complaints. I'd say I care about it a lot less than others."
