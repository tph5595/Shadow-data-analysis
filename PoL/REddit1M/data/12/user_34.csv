16799,Combat is fuck tons better than the trash combat in Witcher 3.
16866,"Definitely shouldn't change the weapon system.

Towards the end I wish weapons broke a bit more often."
20492,"Combat overall.

I don't understand how you can think tw3 has better combat. It literally consisted of counter-attack button prompts. Zero movesets changes, zero weapon variation, customization consisted of percentage changes to numbers. 

"
23680,"I mean, there's various weapons with different animations and movesets/speeds. Which have different advantages against certain enemies."
36385,"It's more than the Witcher 3, and it adds plenty."
36468,"Sorry, yeah, its not button prompts but its still the counter-attack Assassins Creed style combat.

Personally I can't stand that Batman-Arkham style combat. It's just incredible lazy and boring. It's definitely something I *wish* I could stomach. "
157067,"I've acknowledged that its definitely subjective to me, I don't find the reaction times/control in Witcher 3 challenging at all, so it just feels boring. 

That being said, I still find that to be more limiting than many newer combat systems. "
