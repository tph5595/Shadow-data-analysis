5362,Why would you hope people bash critics for giving certain scores? That's unbelievably stupid.
6625,"&gt;These websites would only give a game a lower score to a good game to generate clicks or because of the reviewer's personal opinions/agenda. If you can't separate your own opinions on a game to give an objective review, you're not a good reviewer, so why defend them.

Since when were reviews supposed to be 100% objective? They're telling people how much they enjoyed a piece of art/entertainment, it's literally impossible to have an objective review. A review SHOULD be an opinion, and it's the job of the reviewer to explain why their opinion is this way. If a review was objective it would just be a completely dry description of the game with no useful information in it at all. Surely reviews with differing opinions helps a consumer to better judge whether they themselves would enjoy it based on what different reviewers did and didn't enjoy?"

That could be an approach for reviewing, but personally I think the reviewer making the reader aware of their biases and explaining why that influenced their opinion, rather than pretending their biases didn't influence their opinion, is much more useful and genuine. A reader might not like the game for the same reasons as the reviewer doesn't based on biases they share for example, and it helps nobody if the reviewer doesn't mention said biases."
