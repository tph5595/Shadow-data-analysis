19580,"I'm fine with someone not liking the game.  This game has flaws.  And if you came into this game with different expectations, you could be seriously disappointed, as it's a lot different than other games in the series.  But saying it doesn't encourage varied playstyles is the most untrue thing you can say about the game.  That's what makes it better than the other Zelda games, heck, better than almost any game.  You're absolutely right about him not trying to find joy in it.  "
