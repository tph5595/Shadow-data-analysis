11781,"Botw isnt a Masterpiece. Far from it. People have just been waiting for this for so long and they wanted more Zelda. Thats it, thats all. The game still has obvious flaws and issues that the ""we overlooked this because the rest is so good"" doesnt make the game justice - it just tries to hide the ugly for the sake of pleasing Nintendo to be in favor with them.


Yes the gameplay is quite amazing for the MOST part but the complete lack of narrative hurts the game more than anything, everything is ""open"" but doesnt need to be explored at all to complete the game, 100% completion just becomes an Xbox Achievement list at this point.


The inverted difficulty curve is one thing I really dislike - you start out with little and you meet - some - challenges but as soon as you've ""progressed"" a bit (armor, hearts, maybe a power or two from beasts) the game becomes extremely easy - sure you have to be careful about certain things still but they are not great challenges. Just the fact that someone can beat all bosses (if you dont do the beasts, you face all 4 blight ganons + full hp calamity ganon + beast ganon) with 3 hearts and a couple of weapons and shields handed out pretty much unchallenged in the very ""last"" dungeon of Hyrule Castle just shows how very little Nintendo cared about difficulty. Because they made ""Hard Mode"" a paid DLC and we're not sure if thats even going to be all that ""hard"" - no details, pay now and MAYBE youll like it .. when its ready!


The menuing has already been agreed by almost everyone at this point. Very very annoying.


The art direction, the style is great but it is extremely dated and even then the 2 ""consoles"" that the game is available on both have a hard time running it properly to today's standards and even fail to meet the standards for the most part.


And that goddamn Voice Actor for princess Zelda in English just ruins all the memory cutscenes for me, gotta switch to another language"
