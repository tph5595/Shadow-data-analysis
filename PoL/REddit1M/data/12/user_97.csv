go play and enjoy the game like the rest of us, and stop whining just because someone doesn't share your opinion.

For fucks sake the man gave Witcher 3 an 8.5/10, the game that now holds the record for most GOTY awards ever won and will probably hold onto that record for a long time, and yet the Witcher community didn't throw a hissy fit over it. "

Just Cause 3's map is 1000 sq km. BotW isn't even close. It's not even the biggest map from this week with Wildlands clocking in at 200 sq km.

The most **recent and valid sources** (as in  post-release) on BotW size I can find is below from six days ago, at only about 10.6 sq miles or 28 sq km.

And the original math is here

Going by those numbers, the only legitimate ones available right now, it's about a fifth of the size of Witcher 3, as Witcher is 136 sq km - not including Toussaint.

Even if we use the other estimation here:

Double the size of Skyrim *still* isn't close to the size of Witcher 3 and isn't even on the same level as Wildlands or Just Cause.    "
