23996,Got a source for this? Because I highly doubt that is the case. 
24112,ITT: People who can't handle someone not towing the line and fairly reviewing a game and giving their honest thoughts. If only someone's review didn't directly affect your enjoyment of a game. What a world that would be hey. 
25897,I haven't been able to read the review yet since the website is down. 
29306,"He doesn't mention the high reviews at all. I tend to agree with most of his points. Performance alone is enough for me to question the almost universal high scores and should have been enough to stop any 10/10 reviews because it's atrocious. Any PC game that performed like this does at launch would be crucified, see Arkham Knight et al. 

I agree with his issues with how difficulty is implemented though it does get less annoying as you go on, I'm still being one hit by some archers with level 3 gear and 12 heart containers though which is frustrating. I also agree that while shrines are fun and some of the puzzles are challenging, locking hearts and stamina upgrades away behind 4 of them is a bit annoying, especially with how fast stamina is used. And I also agree the the starting amount of stamina is way too little. 

I don't have as much of an issue with breaking equipment as he did. Though I do tend to dislike weapon degredation as a system in all games and would say that its not well handled in this, especially in the case of 'unique' equipment like the hylian shield or quest reward weapons like the lightscale spear, and agree that the cost to have them recovered is prohibitively high to the point where I haven't bothered after they've broken which removes a lot of the lustre of the unique equipment. 

I came to this as my first Zelda game. I came in very skeptical of the universally high praise the game had received and was blown away by the game. It has so many little details which are excellent and make it feel like a living world. I've been able to get lost in it in a much more meaningful way than I have in most other games. But it has a lot of issues that stop it from being perfect. It hasn't beat out Witcher 3 for me as a whole game experience, but I enjoy the open world design of BotW a lot more than W3 even if I think as a package, especially story wise, W3 is the better game (using W3 here because for me it's my top game ever, ymmv). After a few hours I was willing to concede that maybe it deserved the 10/10s it was getting, but after 40 or so hours the little annoyances and issues are becoming more of a persistent issue, especially performance. Overall I would agree with the majority of what Jim says (full disclosure, I tend to find that I usually do agree with him) and if I had to give a rating of the game now would put it at about 7.5-8/10, though I will say I have not finished the game as of yet, 3/4 Beasts and I am just sort of wandering around and exploring at the moment.

32439,390sqkm isn't even close to the largest in game map. Just Cause 2 is 400square miles which is around 1000sqkm. Just Cause 3 is about the same. BotW is still big but saying it's the biggest is wrong.

42439,"It would be interesting to know where the corners of BotW's map are located for the sqkm measurement, because a good portion of the bottom right and left is ocean as well (the gulf between Eventide and the Mainland for example)"
43769,"Same goes for Just Cause though, so its a moot point either way. "
230461,"Glad to! I was always a PlayStation player. First Nintendo console was my wiiu (aside from gameboy for orig Pokemon and then my 3ds) so I never really got into Mario or Zelda. The only real exposure I had to them was in smash bros on n64.

The world interests me but I don't think the old games are likely to grab me as BotW has. "
