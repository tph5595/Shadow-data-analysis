31015,"&gt; There are only 2 acceptable scores for Botw: 9/10 and 10/10

This is absolutely ridiculous, his service to players is telling them what he thinks about the game, not telling them what they want to hear. Critics that CRITICISE are part of what makes any industry healthy. There is far too much positivity in gaming right now for its own good."

I haven't played the game yet, though there hasn't been a game I've wanted to play quite as much as BotW for probably over 2 years now  (if Nintendo can keep the Switch in stock during its next run, I would very much like to get one and play). The bit of your initial comment I quoted, for me, is incredibly counter productive. I can only think of two games since the beginning of 2013 that I have truly enjoyed: Ori and the Blind Forest and the Witcher 3. Everything else I have seen or played has been an uninspired showing of absolute mediocrity. Gaming is literally my only hobby and I'm tired of the quality of games dropping off as publishers chase a casual audience that refuses to take a stand and demand better, who continually forks over cash to pay for the same crap year after year. 

So yes, I'm sure a lot of the games that Jim has previously given above a 7 are not as good as Zelda. However, we need to stop pulling punches. If there are things that can be improved in a game, we need to insist on their improvement, to give harsh criticism and lower than expected scores. We need to readjust our scale of what makes a game worthy of an 8/10, set the bar high and tell publishers to let their studios surpass it. "
