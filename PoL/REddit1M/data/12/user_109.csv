67313,"I can tell you for a fact that even in medieval times, well-forged weapons did NOT break when hitting steel, much less bone. Have you seen, during swordplay for example, people deflecting another weapon's strike with their own? That only works because weapons are made to handle strong impact from and against solid matter, again and again, without breaking (edges dull, but weapon breakage is very rare). 

If weapons worked the way BotW does them it wouldn't be worth the time and effort to forge them."
