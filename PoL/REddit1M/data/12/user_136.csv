133712,"&gt; He's not a paid reviewer or even a professional one. 

He either is, or has been in the past (I don't follow his employment status day-to-day, and don't visit the site), a reviewer and review editor on Destructoid, so it's inaccurate to say he's not a professional. 

It doesn't really detract from your point, and wasn't intended to. Just correcting the record, as they say. :) "
