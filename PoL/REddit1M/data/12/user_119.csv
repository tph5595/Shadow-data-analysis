93067,"So are you arguing that the new game isn't carried by any nostalgia and simple thirst for a new zelda title? Like, really?

&gt;realise you're playing an absolute masterpiece of game design

So the weapon durability isn't at all an issue? No need to ever complain about that? It's not like they couldn't have looked at games developed by intelligent systems(cough Fire Emblem) and get an idea of weapon durability. No, a simple numbered use system wouldn't have worked in the game, but something more than what it has. Maybe something closer to Morrowind's?

And that's only one point. The basis of your argument essentially revolves around, ""well, everyone else gave this game a 10/10 and I THINK it's the best shit since sliced bread, so it's a bad review and attention seeking if it says otherwise."" You're literally saying that if someone doesn't like something about the game, they are wrong because you said so because you have this idea that it's the absolute epitome of game design. Please."

The bug in Skyrim where Dragon's textures don't load in is minor. People complaining about weapon degradation because they feel weapons don't last long enough is just as valid, and possible more so, as you saying that YOU don't have an issue with it.

You're really going out of your own way to say the game is the best shit ever, and that everyone saying anything about it that they don't like is nitpicking and hating on the game; which is funny, because not only did Jim say repeatedly that he liked it and enjoyed it, but he's not the only person saying how much they dislike the weapon degradation."

That's all good and fine, you do you and all that. But you seem to have this notion that there is nothing wrong with the game and anyone that says otherwise on literally any grounds is wrong because ?????"
