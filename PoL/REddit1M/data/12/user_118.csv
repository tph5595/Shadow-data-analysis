You either accept all opinions, or none of them. One opinion is no more valid or invalid than another on something as subjective as enjoyment of a game. I have a friend who likes rocket league, I don't. Are either of us wrong?"
93099,"So if those same websites said the game was shit, would you?"
96559,Is the game being in the top 4 doing something for you or...?
96861,So is the game in your top 4?
114962,Are you for real or is this a case of sarcasm not coming across the internet very well?

It's a shame because I have seen quite a few places out in the world that could have been the entrance to a dungeon (Forgotten Temple comes to mind). The bosses are good though, so it really saddens me we couldn't of had more. In fact I think the combat as a whole is very enjoyable.

However, in my second play through the shrines are getting kind of tedious as I already know the solution to most of them, as well as the location. Focusing on exploration is well and good, but it seems to only really work the first time in really engaging you. It's not exploring if you already know what's there. It's nice to find a Korok seed you may have missed, but I already have all the inventory slots I need. In the other Zelda games, the dungeons are usually fun enough on their own to warrant a 2nd run but...

Oh, I feel the need to mention the performance issues that pop up occasionally. Not a HUGE deal breaker or anything for me, but it would have been nice to have had an option to reduce the graphics to increase performance if one was so inclined. Fighting the lynel in the coliseum in the rain with fire weapon particles and what not did not agree with my Wii U.

Now that I think about what you were saying, I understand now. I was having a moment."
