Honest question since I haven't played it, but breakable weapons have been around since... at *least* 2010 woth Fallout New Vegas  (probably earlier, but even then, it's a 7 year old concept)."

I've got mates with swords they've used for 10 years of HEMA, that's steel hitting the jard edges of other weapons, hit plate and chain male armor.

Even with broze weapons all you needed to do was take to the forge and hammer it out after the battle to bring the edge back.

Real weapons (ones actually purpose built for battle, not like... sharpened chair legs) don't break like they do in these ""immersive"" video games. "

Still sounds like it would be annoying acquiring the more awesome and powerful weapons and then having to constantly hold off on using them in case they break before a more powerful and appropriate enemy comes along for you to use them on."
