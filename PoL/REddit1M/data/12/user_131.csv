111272,"You are making the mistake of defending the mechanics of a game you like, but attacking another game and calling it trash.

The combat between the games is worlds different. In witcher is more about reaction time and control. The breath of the wild is more about spontaneity and creativity. "
112487,"Lotta people are up his ass over it. I do not think he deserves it.....

But the context of the review seems like him being negative towards it for the sake of not being part of the crowd. He kept on looking at tiny details and being of a negative mindset because of the reviews. You can tell with the tone and wording at many parts of it...... when it was accessible at least. Dunno what happened.

It is honestly something i have seen Jim do before honestly. Emphasizing on the negative over the positive to ensure a comparatively negative score compared to others. "
112778,"While msot reviewers are overly positive, as the game does osund like a eight in terms of what it provides, Jim is overtly negative. 

he is just generally that way. When its obvious that a game is liked he goes in negatively. "
112917,"I would like it if you could buy them at least.... Though there is a weirdly roundabout way to repair them. 

There are octoroks that inhale thigns before attacking you. If you have a weapon dropped near them, they will swallow it up, you see a weird aura apepar, and they spit it out, repaired. Can even turn rusted weapons into nicer ones."
113046,Think the only reviewr that still keeps 6 and 7 as a good score is Angry joe. 
113216,Would say it does have some consierable issues. Framerate drops are annoying and the weapon degrading varies between those who play a game. However i agree that 7 has become overtly negative these days. And that the review was geared towards a certain direction. 
113362,"Guy doesn't deserve the ddos but his review was geared towards nitpicking and showed he went in just to hate the game.

You can definitely tell when someone is trying to hate the fuck outta something from the get go, their tone and behavior."
113454,I will aggre that it is not as bad as with Dishonored 2. But it is sitll very present. 
113585,"Taht is becuase you are throwing them dude. Weapon throwing is largely designed towards giving a damaged weapon one last kudegra before it is finished. Or using weak and especialyl disposable wepaons to maximum potential. 
And strategically. Throw that weak bokoclub to send a high levle bokoblin tumbling, then rob his of his higher level gear and such.

113689,"Lotta people are jsut outright overreacting to his review. Albeit a major trigger is that it was a review that had an agenda to be negative and contrary. 

I understand opinion. It is far from a ten in his book. Mechanically spekaing it is probably an 8 at least. But he has acted to be a contrarian before. His dishonored 2 review for example. "
280924,"And being intentionally negative to be contrary to that is literally no better. Which is what jim does far too often. What he did with Dishonored 2. the description i read in the review makes it seem like he intentionally ignored mechanics to just complicate his experience and justify his negativity. 

Hem ight have given it a 7 but the review sounded like he wanted to give it far less."
2561427,"i have played the game. high durability weapons last multiple encounters for me. largely cause i try to find other ways to soften em up first
