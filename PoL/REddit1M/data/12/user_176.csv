Like he says, It takes any enjoyment out of finding a cool weapon knowing that it will break in a minute. 7/10 is a good score, there is nothing overly negative about it. I am a huge zelda fan but I find myself not too enthused with this game, it just doesn't seem as good a previous Zelda titles and if a next gen (current gen) game does not feel better than a previous gen game than it does not deserve a better score.
