14915,This is the /r/Zelda subreddit. It's an echo chamber of people with raging boners over all things zelda. Constructive criticism is in turn criticized to oblivion here. If you don't think BOTW is GOTYAY then you're literally Hitler here.
15324,"I think the more time you spend in BOTW the more most of his, and other's, criticisms hold true. I get the argument for weapons breaking like they're made of card board and balsa wood but after playing the game for 20+ hours it just gets super tedious and monotonous. I think the *assumed* point of the breaking weapons that's constantly stated (I.e. It makes you try new approaches) is better achieved by enemy behavior and strengths/weaknesses which is honestly already in the game, which dictates what's the best approach, weapons, and techniques to use against them. As it is the super frail weapons on top of that is unnecessary tedium and busywork. This becomes more apparent the longer you spend with the game."
