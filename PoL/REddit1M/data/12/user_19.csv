For me, a 10 doesn't mean the game is perfect, it just means that whatever flaws the game has are miniscule in comparison to all of the good the game has to offer, and they don't keep the game from being a masterpiece. Of course, the problems you pointed out probably are a bigger deal to you than they are to those who believe the game deserves a 10, so it depends on who you ask. My point is that if a 10 means that a game is perfect and it has no flaws, then no game deserves a 10."
