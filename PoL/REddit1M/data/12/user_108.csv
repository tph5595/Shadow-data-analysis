Zelda has plenty of flaws, most of them technical for sure. It's an 8 or 9 for me all told. Nothing at all brings it to a 10. The story is not good enough. The graphics are not good enough. And the fucking gameplay is not quite good enough.

We need reviews like this to balance things out even if the game was really an 8 or whatever you want to give it.The fact so many reviewers gloss over so much with this game is pathetic."

But technically this game is being held back imo and that should reflect on the score a tiny bit. The 7 is a bit much but I am sure that was for clicks. This game deserved way more 9s than 10s IMO. The story is clearly not good enough to push it into 10 territory for me."
3772094,I like the game a lot. I have no idea what you are talking about. But this is FAR FAR from a near perfect game lol.
3772446,LOL all this because someone gave the game a 7. These are clearly young children obsessed with reviews for no other reason than they have nothing else to do.
