51468,Guys i hate to break it to you but it's not the best game ever. 7 /10 is a perfectly good score and is what I'd personally give the game
222443,"So do you believe it's the best game to ever exist?

And if you do please explain it to me cause i really don't see it"
222482,Exactly
355758,But I'm asking YOU. On a personal level do you believe it's the second best game ever created (metacritic) or do you have your own opinion?
