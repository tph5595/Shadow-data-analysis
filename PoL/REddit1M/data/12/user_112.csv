76100,"Since people DDoS'd his site and I can't read the review, I'm just going to give my own opinions on the matter:

- After beating the 4 divine beasts, I've stopped playing as much since I realized how quickly the main story will end, and just like Skyrim, I'd probably stop playing instantly once it's over (I did later return to Skyrim with a new file and a new way to play the game without doing the main story, while BOTW you're fairly limited in comparison. You can't go a Mage or Rogue route for example, so I probably won't be returning to BOTW for years and years to come).

- The amount of enemies in this open world game are staggeringly low. You've got Bokoblins, Moblins, Lizalfos, and a few varying Guardians. That's it for the bulk of enemies you face. I'm deep into this game and I've only seen 4 major enemy types. Sure there's a few minibosses and the uncommon Chuchus, Keese, or other 1-shottable mobs that are so forgettable they barely count, but when 90-95% of the things you fight are literally 1 of 4 different mobs, it gets repetitive.

- The game itself feels very limiting in customization for an open world game. You have 3 equipment slots for armor (of which you generally equip 2 or 3 of the same set pieces for resistance or something else), 3 different melee weapon types (1h, 2h, and Spear) [and the uncommon Rod], Bow&amp;Arrow, and either upgrading Health or Stamina, of which, Health is literally mandatory to get to 13 at some point (for spoilers I won't get into). Again, for an open world game, very limiting.

- While I actually like the durability system and needing to get new weapons, I think they break a little too quickly. I don't think a Moblin should take 2.5 of my ""Durability Up"" Weapons to kill. It's hard to get excited about a special new weapon when it's literally gone after 0-2 mobs.

Like don't get me wrong, the game is great, and while I'd love to see what Jim had to say that people are literally DDoSing his site over, I can see why people can have issues with it and not give it a 10/10. I shouldn't be losing this much interest in an open world game this quickly. I also didn't buy my Switch until like the 8th, so I'm also 5 days behind everyone who got it day 1 and is still enjoying it thoroughly. I still do love just generally exploring and finding a Shrine or some new material type, but the bulk of the game just feels lacking to me in some way. Once you're free to explore the whole world, it feels great. Around the 2nd or 3rd Divine Beast though, the excitement just slowed down to an extreme halt for me (and I did a TON before doing more than 1 Divine Beast. Hell I did a lot before even doing the first!)

Idk, that's just me and my two cents and I'm sure I'm going to get crucified for giving criticism about a beloved Zelda game, but hey, it's how I see it so whatever.

PS: I'd love for someone to (calmly and without bashing) prove me wrong and tell me why BOTW deserves the ridiculous praise it gets. I get it, it's a great game, but from my hours and hours of experience, so far, not deserving of a perfect score. I'd give it more like an 8.5, maybe 9/10."
