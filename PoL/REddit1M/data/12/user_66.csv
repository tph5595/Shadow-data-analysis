Maybe his (justified) antipathy for Nintendo swayed his score downward unconsciously. Hopefully he'll feel embarassed about it one day :)

There are only 2 acceptable scores for Botw: 9/10 and 10/10. Anything else is a disservice to players trying to choose between BOTW and another game. The game is amazing. It's not a coincidence it got the most 10/10 reviews in the history of videogames. Not a coincidence at all."
31602,"My first sentence was literally ""The man is entitled to his opinion"". 

Here's the thing. If we lived in a universe where half the games out there were better than Zelda. Then that 7/10 would be perfectly acceptable.

But we don't live in that world, we live in a world where the vast, crushing majority of games that are rated over 7/10 are not as good as Zelda. Do you disagree with that assessment?

So therefore, in MY opinion (to which I am just as entitled as Jim is to his), the only reasonable ratings for the game are 9/10 or 10/10.

&gt;Critics that CRITICISE are part of what makes any industry healthy.

he criticized the game plenty in the text of his review, as did many other reviewers. The only difference is they didn't take off 30% of the game score because of its imperfections. "
38051,"Lord...Am I explaining myself THAT badly? In MY OPINION, the only score that I deem reasonable is between 9-10. **If it's less than that, then I will think the reviewer has bad taste in video games.** That's what I mean by ""acceptable"". Acceptable to ME and me only. 

If someone gives Aladdin a 7/10, I will feel the same way about that. If someone gives Michael Jackson a 7/10 as an artist, i'll feel the same. If someone rates Final Fantasy VI or VII  7/10, I'll feel the same. If someone rates The Wire 7/10, same deal. 

And on and on and on. It's all about MY worldview of what makes a good game/movie/music/whatever. 

I mean..what else could I have possibly meant? Give me some credit here. And you didn't answer my question. Here it is again:

we live in a world where the vast, crushing majority of games that are rated over 7/10 are not as good as Zelda. Do you disagree with that assessment?

YES OR NO?"
88435,"play it and come back to me. My opinion is worth something. Yours is worth nothing as long as you don't play the game.

Some opinions are more right than others :)"
88628,"play the game before you comment...honestly. Nobody cares about generic defense of reviewer's opinions. Of course they're entitled to it. Of course this is all personal taste. I was attempting to debate something beyond that.

Of course reviewers should not pull punches. on the other hand, one could argue that 99% of the notable games that get widely reviewed deserve a score above 5/10. The others never make it through production and get pulled, or are indie games (IE: digital homicide crap) that never gets reviewed. "
102234,"Your friend is wrong.
What score would you give the game? 

I only accept my own opinion as the right one, everybody else is wrong unless they agree with it, in which case they are smart and wise and handsome.

It's really not complicated."
120092,"My question was for real. what score would you give BOTW. I'm curious.

The rest, well..come on now :P"
167881,"Good review! Thanks. Hopefully I'll grab a used switch with the game this afternoon and get to playing.

Performance issues are more of a deal breaker for me. Could not bring myself to play it to completion on the WiiU :/
