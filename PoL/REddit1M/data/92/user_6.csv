52915,"I'm playing in master mode and looking to do the Champion's Ballad, but the quest isn't appearing. I've done all the beast  dungeons and finished the quest. Should I do anything else? I've already tried porting around the map and passing time hoping for Zelda to say something but nothing's happening. Is there something else I need to do?"
55754,I went there as soon as I finished off the Beasts. Nothing there but a little korok fella. 
71218,Looks like I forgot to hit up Bludo to finish Rudania's Quest. It finally popped up as soon as I left the next shrine.  Thanks for all your help!
