367127,Sadly they've came out and said they aren't doing anymore DLC :(
367569,"I always hate challenges here that get complicated rules, go for something simple:

- If you see an enemy you have to fight them (Guardians, Lynel's etc all included) 
- Always equip/use your highest rated weapon/bow/shield
- No Fast travel
"
367888,I mean Karok seeds? Beat the game? We have to know where you are to give you advice. 
368350,"Yeah, once you've gotten that far there isn't a lot more to do except your self-made challenges with things like what I advised earlier;

- Must Fight every enemy you see
- Must always use your best equipped weapon (except Master Sword)
- Never Fast Travel

Stuff like that. "
368616,"Have you done the basic, go to Hyrule field and fight/clear all the guardians? "
369053,"You welcome. 

I think the fighting every enemy you see and always using the best equipped weapon will make this a bit harder, as you'll go through your best weapons fairly fast, and be fighting whatever the lower level guys have, won't be able to do weapon weaknesses as you'll go through those too fast (ie no fire sword on ice guys, since it's already broken), and you'll get a lot more blood moons as you'll kill more enemies... I think it'll end up being a fun challenge.
