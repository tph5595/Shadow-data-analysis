348959,"I finished this one just a few days ago. If you go all the way up to the top-ish area of the hill (there will be a little tent-thing up there) there should be some small snowballs grouped up. You should also be surrounded by little divets/paths in the snow, that look like they go down the hill. 

I started on the furthest to the left path, dropped a snowball and let it roll down. I think it ended up being the 3rd, or 4th path from the left-most, but I don't recall that detail exactly.

Hope this helps!"
