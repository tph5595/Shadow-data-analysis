230410,"Thinking of getting this game for my little sister, she’s 9 almost 10. She just got a switch and loves it, but hasn’t played many open world or adventure games. Would she enjoy it or is she more likely to get lost and overwhelmed? 

Edit: I know she may not fully understand the nuance of the story or complete every side quest but is the core gameplay enjoyable for her age and will the game nudge her along the main quests? "
