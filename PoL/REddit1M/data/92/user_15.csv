You should be able to get level 2 with the dragon horn if you throw in something like warm/cold darners or sunshrooms/chillshrooms."
92771,"Master mode is really something you'll want to save for a second playthrough IMO, the game is plenty hard enough as it is even in normal mode, especially near the beginning. You'll still die plenty of times.

It requires a certain level of familiarity with the game's mechanics to properly enjoy master mode, I imagine most would find it frustrating if it was their first experience of playing the game.

Even on the first playthrough I think the DLC is worth owning though, there are some pretty cool additions to the game in there."
92908,"I believe the chance of a blood moon appearing is proportionate to how many enemies you've killed since the last blood moon. I remember trying for hours to get a blood moon one time, before getting frustrated and looking for answers online and found this out - so I went and killed a bunch of guardians/hinox/lynels. Went back and tried again, got a blood moon on the 2nd night."
123278,"Some are used for upgrading armour, but the main effect of them is that if you drop regular blue ones and expose them to elements (fire etc) they'll turn into a chuchu jelly of that type. Then if you hit them with something like an arrow they'll explode. Say you want to freeze a bokoblin, you might drop a white chuchu jelly on the ground and get him to run over it, then if you shoot the jelly it'll freeze everything in a small area.

Kind of a niche use, although red chuchu jellies are great for lighting fires."
177713,"I haven't actually tried that, but no I don't think they work that way. My understanding is that they're supposed to ""store"" energy which is only released when you hit them."
297879,"I think that's a pretty good age to get into the series. I was playing Ocarina of Time at 8 and even though I'd never played a game like it before and it took me an absurdly long time to progress, it was still great trying to work everything out and just mess around in the world. Kids will often find enjoyment in games just running around and doing their own thing, she doesn't necessarily have to finish it right away."
423804,"If those 500 hours were all on the same save file? 

A new playthrough. Absolute gamechanger for me, the game feels completely different when you have limited resources early in the game and everything is more of a struggle. I find that a lot of the things that made the game fun when I first played it are still fun on new playthroughs - the process of moving through the world, finding towers, discovery being rewarded with shrines etc.

Makes all the difference. If I load up a complete save file with an inventory full of crazy weapons and gear I get bored pretty quick, but a new save file will keep me engaged all evening."
423987,"I think the expansion pass has some pretty good additions to the game. Trial of the Sword is one of my favourite parts of the game now and I look forward to doing it whenever I start a new playthrough, and many of the new shrines/other challenges from the 2nd pack are really interesting."
