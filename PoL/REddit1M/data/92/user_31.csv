279635,Still on the beginning stages. What's the trick to beating the shrine that has the robot with the two blue blades that can both shoot and chop you?  It's the one that's on the ledge of that high cliff south east of Heteno.  Apols that I forget the name.  Thanks
279796,what are the stable beetles?  are they actually at the stables or just a name?  I'm asking because I'm chronically low on arrows all the time and rarely get them from enemy kills.

289709,Cool thanks.  The fighting is hard for me because you have to control the camera angle at the same time.
