179703,"One of the flaws of the DLC is that the new DLC armour cannot be upgraded, and so gets outclassed over time. That means that the DLC armour is most valuable in the early game (by which, I’d probably be talking about the first 30 hours mind you, so not a blip, especially in your first play through). Also you don’t immediately unlock the armour, instead that game sends you on treasure hunts with vague clues. I got the DLC after completing the game which completely trivialised the treasure hunts, since I was familiar enough with the map at that point to decipher the clues within minutes. 

Plus, the hero’s map mode which tracks your movement is really cool and only comes with the DLC. It actually encouraged me to limit my use of fast travel, because I got a lot of enjoyment being able to track my journey around Hyrule. It’s cool to have it from the start of the game, rather than getting the dlc late and for it to start tracking mid-way through. 

One of the major additions of the DLC allows you to boost the Master Sword’s power. So it’s a neat thing to get before you finish the game. 

Finally, at the end of the second DLC you unlock a new mode of transport (I won’t say more, though it’s not a huge spoiler - It even featured in some of the DLC launch marketing). If you’ve already been everywhere you want to go when you unlock it, well, that dampens the value of the reward a bit (I’d call this a flaw of the game design, but it’s not a big one). 

I’d say if you’re certain you want to buy the DLC, get it early and you’ll get more mileage out of it. If you’re on the fence about spending your money, that’s fine - the game is brilliant without the DLC, and even if you buy it ‘late’ you’ll still get plenty enjoyment out of it. "
