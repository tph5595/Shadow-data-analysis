559813,"A few weeks ago I randomly started playing Pikmin 3 on my Wii U, years after I got it for free with the purchase of another game. I didn't really expect to play much of it but I ended up chewing through it like a madman. It was a ton of fun. It's a very relaxing (but still at times challenging) game, can only recommend!"

At the moment I'm playing Super Mario Odyssey, imagine how that feels lol. Finding all the moons seems to be damn near impossible without looking them up online."

Dude.

&gt;If you use Hint Toad and Talkatoo together it's not only possible, but quite simple to find them all on your own without ever looking up a guide.

How does the hint system actually work? I kept running out of hints so I stopped bothering with them. When do you get new ones?"
594187,Ahh so I probably ran out because I wasn't able to get the rest because I needed to unlock some stuff first? Well screw me for trying to 100% every world before moving on lol
