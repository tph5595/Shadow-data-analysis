365658,"I have played BoTW for around 500 hours, and I'm coming to the point where the game is a bit stalling for me, anyone has some suggestions to still get joy out of the game? I've noticed this isn't a strange thing, since I have seen probably all of the game's components, but there must something I could do. Thanks in regards!"
