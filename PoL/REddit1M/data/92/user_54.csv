471906,I just buy arrows everytime I see Beedle or happen to be in a village with a shop. Maybe not the most cost effective way but it means I have heaps - and if you sell some gems or something at the same time it works out :)
472090,"Definitely the DLC is worth it when you start. I wouldn't do master mode though unless you like frustratingly difficult games.
But the first DLC pack adds a lot of little things that makes the game a lot better, like Hero's Path on the map (I find this invaluable because I can see areas I never have walked through so just explore and usually end up with at least a couple of Korok seeds and new weapons, etc), the Korok mask is also really good. "
472169,"I only started playing somewhat recently - I've done 3 of the 4 divine beasts and unlocked all the map except for the ""top left"" section - when can and when *should* I do the Champion's ballad quests? Can I do them for each champion that I have already met and beaten? Or do I have to beat Ganon first?"
472527,"I think it absolutely is. The first DLC pack is almost essential when you are still doing the main quest for things like the Korok mask and the Hero's Path mode on the map. I haven't played the 2nd one yet but watched my brother do a bit of it and it looks like there's a heap of extra shrines to do as well as a 5th ""temple""/divine beast :)"
475490,"Awesome, thank you :) Will go and work out how to get into the Gerudo village and beat that divine beast and then do the Ballad!"
