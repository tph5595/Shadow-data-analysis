246554,"My 8-years old son had never played these types of games either (in fact no console games at all) and he is amazed and plays a lot and talks about the game all the time. In fact I bought it for me assuming it would be too hard for him and man I was sooo wrong. He has already beaten 3 divine beasts. Even my 5-years old is close to beating his first divine beast, though in this case with ""a bit"" of help. All 3 of us add up to more than 300 hours of gameplay, I never though it would be such a success at home. "
