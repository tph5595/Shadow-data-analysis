197655,"What's the best way to reach the Lanno Kooh shrine? It's the one just East of Hebra Plunge, and it's surrounded by cold water. I ended up swimming to it and using food to tank the cold damage, but I wanted to know if there was a more elegant solution.

I noticed that there's some wood just outside the shrine. Can I use that to make a raft or something?"
