45397,Is the blood moon always a full moon? I’m currently waiting on one and it’s going slow. 
47961,I’ll try that. I’ve wasted two hours waiting on a stupid blood moon again
96027,I read that too. Unfortunately I’ve killed a pretty small amount of enemies since the last one popped up. 
292522,I gave up. It’s going to be the last one I get now. 
435251,How many shrines are added with the dlc? I only have one shrine left in the base game. 
435356,I actually got a blood moon last night (two in about 30 minutes of course) and saw it around 10:20. I was able to travel to the nearest shrine and get where I needed to go just in time. 
449761,Cool thanks. 
489714,Oh that sucks. I wanted 30 hearts and 3 wheels of stamina. I guess I’ll have to settle for 28
605531,Well I don’t want to spoil anything for you but I’ll tell you if you want.
