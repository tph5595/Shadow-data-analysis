281357,"You will find quite a few of these throughout the game and they vary with difficulty. When you enter the shrine the challenge title will say either a minor/modest/major test of strength. Early on in the game with low level weapons it's tough to complete the modest/major test of strength so save those for later. If it's minor then you just need to time your dodges and you can also parry the laser back at them with your shield (google: zelda guardian laser parry). Also when they start spinning around like crazy, hide behind a pillar so they knock in to it and it will stun them for a few seconds opening up a chance to get some good damage in. "
