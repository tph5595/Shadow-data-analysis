89839,I would like to know the recipes for the best heat and cold resistance. I farmed some Farosh Horn's and I would like to make the 'level 3' elixer/food/recipe where you get three sun icons instead of 1 when you look at it in the menu. 
97674,"What is the fastest way to get arrows? I'm stuck without right now and don't know a fast way to get them, merchants don't sell a lot. Thanks for helping me! "
275703,"How much extra attack power does the barbarian armor gives? Right now I have three pieces on level four but I don't know how much it improves my attacks. 

Would also like to know if the attack power increase changes when I wear 2 out of 3 items (let's say helmet and legs) instead of all three. I know I'll lose the 3 set bonus but I don't really care about that, I just want to wear it for my attack power increase but I just prefer the Champion's Tunic "
290390,Is this with all items equiped or the level ur gear is? Thanks for the numbers anyway!
