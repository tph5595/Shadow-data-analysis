Check in your adventure log to see if you've actually completed all ""Divine Beast Vah [x]"" quests. They aren't complete when you beat the boss and activate the terminal, you have to talk to an NPC."

227218,"Notice how, after you leave the shrine, there are logs there waiting to be pushed into the water and drift outside? Riding a log downstream is the ""intended"" method of getting in the cave. You could also climb from the outside into the interior walls of the cave and jump to the shrine if you have enough stamina"

290871,The level of gear doesn't change its effect at all (in this case Attack Up). It just affects the armor stat and allows for set bonuses. Each piece of Barbarian armor only gives one level of Attack Up no matter what

561368,"I'm like that too. On top of getting 100% in BotW on Master Mode, I actually bothered getting every chest in the game too. Couldn't tell you why.

Actually, Odyssey is very good with completionism. If you use Hint Toad and Talkatoo together it's not only possible, but quite simple to find them all on your own without ever looking up a guide. Tracking missing purple coins is amiibo-locked though, which is bullshit"
566345,"You can get as many Hint Toad markers as there are moons available in the kingdom you're in, as long as you keep paying him. With Talkatoo he'll tell you the names of up to three moons at once (the moons' names are often hints at how to get them). Combine those together, and you'll have a marker of a moon's location plus its name (read it from the moon list) which is a hint for how to get it. Repeat for every single moon you don't have."
