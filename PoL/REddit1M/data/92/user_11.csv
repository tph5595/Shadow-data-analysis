87337,I would say that Master Mode is very much meant for a second playthrough as some of the bosses or larger health enemies can be a real pain to kill. You can buy the DLC whenever you please but I would recommend doing the Champion's Ballad before you beat the game.
560508,It is not. I tried to find it out of curiosity but there is no point at which the castle is that far away from you. It is inspired by in-game locations (obviously) but I donâ€™t think the exact spot exists.
