34517,I'm getting my ass whopped in this game. Not sure I'm doing missions in the right order. Is there a newbie guide for those of us new to RPGs? Like what should I do first or second etc? Help! :(
50019,Thx. I found a wiki guide in IGN. helped me get thru some missions. I'm annoyed that I don't know how to beat guardians (the spider octopus looking metal thingies). Shall I just run? They kill me with one hit. :(
