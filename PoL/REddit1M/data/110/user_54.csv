34926,Different tower. I believe the tower you're speaking of is south of Rito Village.
34984,"I circled the area 5-6 times, missing the arch each time before I even found the eye and metal plank. Entirely doable without it, but it does help get around easier where the archers are at."
35791,"If you go to the northernmost point you can glide across the chasm. It's a relatively short path/climb up to the tower where the memory is located, but there are several guardians along the way. I snuck past all of them with no issues, just make sure you have enough stamina for a couple lengthy climbs. (It will play a short cutscene as you arrive within the borders of the castle, but it doesn't trigger anything so don't worry about it. If you open the map you can teleport to an area south of the castle, or you can just glide back across the northern chasm.)"
36303,"My ass was served to me on a silver platter in nearly every tough encounter, I thought I seriously sucked at the game. Once you gather plenty of ingredients and learn what dishes to cook and which elixirs are best for the occasion it becomes laughably easy in all but the toughest of situations.  
  
Any ingredient with ""hearty"" will fully restore your hearts no matter how many or which ingredients you pair it with. I usually just throw a truffle and piece of meat together for a full recovery meal, or you can add several hearty ingredients to extend your hearts out to +4 - +15.  
  
Sneak around and find bugs and lizards, these can be cooked with monster parts to make eixirs. If your hearts are extended +15 and you have a x3 Defense elixir, It will be difficult to even kill yourself by setting down the controller. Bear in mind only 1 active effect can be in use at a time, excluding yellow hearts. You can't have both a defense + speed boost, or offense + sneak boost, only one at a time.  
  
Otherwise all I can tell you is avoid needless encounters, especially if you aren't prepared for them, and practice dodging and perfect parrying. For specific questions, a search usually won't hurt, just try and avoid spoilers if you can."
39049,Thanks! Now I can stop wasting my prime meat.
