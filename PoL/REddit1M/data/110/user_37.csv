You need a bunch of their wings to upgrade the Desert Voe armor, but in true keese fashion, whenever you actually *want* to find the little bastards they're nowhere in sight. I've wandered around the Gerudo Highlands and Hebra Mountain for several nights running and hardly found any."

27196,Thanks!

53181,"Yeah, ""eventually"". Might just be a crap shoot. Of course, as soon as you're climbing a wall or in the middle of a fight, there the little bastards are, but when you're actually looking for them, nothing."
