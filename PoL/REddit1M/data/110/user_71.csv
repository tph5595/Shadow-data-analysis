One thing to note is that this game *is* hard at the start, so it's okay if you find some enemies too difficult and have to run. One of the satisfying things about this game is that the more you explore, the stronger you get. You don't necessarily have to fight too much in the beginning if you're not comfortable. You will get better over time."

There are waterfalls you can use with zora armor (just look at your map). You can also glide from the high cliffs from the east or west side and land within the castle grounds. The castle has many secret entrances and passageways."
