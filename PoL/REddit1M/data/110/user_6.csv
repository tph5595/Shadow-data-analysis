4618,"You'll use them for armor upgrades. If you want to make sure you're able to upgrade items as soon as you can, keep 30-40 of each gem type on hand. You can safely sell the rest."
4733,"I think he's talking about using the camera item. You can hit X to go into ""selfie mode"" and then you have some more control over the zoom and stuff.

If you meant the game's camera in general, the right stick and L button are the only camera controls."
4912,"Mostly it depends on how much you enjoy exploring and how much of a challenge you want the final dungeon/boss to be. You won't really be missing any story content, other than the memories: I would recommend collecting all of those before heading to the finale."

6855,"You can't upgrade the Switch shirt.

There's no real reason to keep the Doublet or the Old Clothes after you have better armor, but you have (effectively) unlimited inventory space for armor so there's no real reason to sell them either. If you're a completionist, hang onto them; if you don't want the inventory clutter, get rid of them. 

(If you do sell them and change your mind later, there's a vendor that you can buy them back from later in the game.)"

26020,"* Watch for shooting stars, and hustle over to where they land. (The star fragment will disappear at dawn.)
* Kill Silver Lynels. Not sure what the drop rate is; I've probably killed a dozen of them and gotten one fragment.
* Do a simple sidequest for a child at the Woodland Stable. Bring a few Octo Balloons.
* Feed dogs in Lurelin Village and the Snowfield Stable.
* Show a girl at the Outskirt Stable your ""legendary weapon"".
* Find one in a chest at the Typhlo Ruins, north of the Lost Woods. "
