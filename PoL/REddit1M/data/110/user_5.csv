I still have 2 or 3 map areas to uncover, and my health (around 9 hearts) and stamina (around a wheel + a half) feel pretty low. Once I've finished the 4th beast, is it worth going around doing more side quests, shrines etc. to improve before going to the castle? I want the Master sword for sure which requires 13 hearts so I will do that at least. Side question; once you finish the game does it re-load to before the ending? Or do you play on after the end?"
