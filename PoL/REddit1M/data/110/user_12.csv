I played 120+ hours and got every shrine and upgraded all my armor before I took on Ganon, and it was stupidly easy.

You start before Ganon after you beat the game, so he's always available to fight again. And you can go ahead and start doing all the shrines and quests you want."

Every area has an NPC that will rebuild champion weapons. You usually need a base weapon, Flint, and an ore (I think it's always a diamond?)."
