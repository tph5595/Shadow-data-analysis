The goron armor is supposed to protect you from extreme heat and fire, right? Then why the heck doesn't that work in the desert? You need the gerudo armor or elexir/food there to keep you cold. 

Of course I know that heat resistance and fireproof seem to be two different things in this game, but that doesn't mean it makes sense. Heat is pretty much... heat, right? It should work the same way."
