16064,You're able to go pretty much anywhere in the game after you pass the great plateau. 
16200,You can't make them last longer but you can get the master sword (which doesn't break) and the hylian shield (very durable)
16298,You can buy the snowquill armour in Rito village
16366,"You can use almost any weapon to do it but it's probably best to use an iron sledge hammer, rock crusher or drill shaft. "
21575,You could but it takes two hits. The master sword also has many better uses where sledge hammers and rock crushers don't. 
89724,"I don't think they do bonus damage. I don't know if any weapon does bonus damage in the game.
And yeah you'll break the weapon but you can find sledge hammers and drills in lots of places. "
