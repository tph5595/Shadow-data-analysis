42941,"Here's a quick summary of the timelines:

At the end of Ocarina of Time, Adult Link defeats Ganon. Zelda uses the Ocarina of Time to send Link back to a point prior to opening the gate in the Temple of Time. This creates a timeline split: The adult timeline, where Ganon is defeated by Adult Link, which leads into the events of Wind Waker; and the child timeline, where Child Link informed the royal family of Ganondorf's plans, which leads into Majora's Mask and Twilight Princess. 

There is also a third alternate timeline, where Link is defeated by Ganon a the end of OoT. This leads to the ""downfall"" timeline, where Ganon must be sealed away by Zelda and the Sages. In this timeline are games like A Link to the Past, Zelda 1, and Zelda 2.

BotW has a lot of references to games from all of the timelines.

Child: Zelda mentions Twilight in the english dub; Ganon's appearance seems to more closely resemble Twilight Princess Ganon.

Adult: Zora's History tablets describe actions from the sage Ruto that only seem compatible with the Adult timeline (and possibly Downfall); Rito and Koroks have only previously appeared in Adult games.

Downfall: The Triforce is possessed by the Royal Family, which is in line with the Downfall lore; Ganon has been resurrected many times which we have only seen in Downfall.

Each of these pieces of evidence can be easily explained.

I personally put Adult as the least likely, since Wind Waker ends with Hyrule being flooded, then Child is somewhat reasonable, with Downfall most likely to me. 

It's a lot of fun to read into the lore and try to find the pieces to put together, so I highly recommend reading up on it. If you have played other Zelda games, it may give you a new perspective on the stories, and if you haven't then you really should!"
