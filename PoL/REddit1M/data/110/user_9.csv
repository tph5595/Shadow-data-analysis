5181,Is there a stash system in the game? Only way i can think of this us to compare it to Diablo. In that game you can stash weapons and armor (i think) for later.

I apologize if that doesn't need to be there. I just didn't want my question removed... 

How can I get back the weapons and shields of the champions? I really liked Urbosa's weapon (that i forgot the name of)  and the daybreaker shield but they both broke and i want them back. "
