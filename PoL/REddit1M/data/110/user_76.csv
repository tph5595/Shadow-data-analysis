77206,"They do bonus damage to Talus, don't they? Plus if they break you have to go get another one, instead of just waiting for the recharge. "
77495,"This is also true for bonus stamina items. Endura Carrots and Enduring Shrooms, that give a tiny sliver of yellow bonus stamina, will also totally refill your regular green stamina.

Which, imo, is fucking stupid. Why create a dish that gives you a full yellow wheel when you can just create three full-restores? Why create anything other than cooked durian for heals when you can get 30 in 10 minutes? 

It makes me wonder if the eating mechanic was different earlier in the development, and they didn't balance it properly after they changed it. "
77661,"A decent way to make your weapons last longer is to create attack up food and use it liberally. Write down good sources of relevant food and revisit them as needed. More damage means fewer hits to kill the enemy, which means getting more use out of them. 

Also shield surfing takes away shield durability. Rocky surfaces will do the most damage, then grass, and I think snow and sand do none. "
77903,I've seen a few people say that the Master Sword broke on them during the Ganon fight. 
77946,"This isn't true. It has higher than it's normal durability, but it will still break. If you use it to farm Guardian parts it will break quite quickly. "
78013,"When it's glowing it has much higher than normal durability, but it's not infinite. The only time it recharges is when it's ""broken"" and has the recharging timer. "
