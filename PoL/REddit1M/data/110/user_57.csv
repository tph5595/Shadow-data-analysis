Corollary: Cooking a single food material in a pot usually/always does *not* just give you ""Roasted [Food Item]."
38267,This is brilliant and I love it.

I warped out, forgot to unequip the Master Sword, and my very first swing of it powered it down. Yet I originally used it during the entire Ganon battle. Thus I conclude that it is sustained for the entire dungeon — or at least the boss fight — no matter what its durability stat is at the time."
