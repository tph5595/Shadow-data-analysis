11171,"Near to Rito village I've found 3 stone circles. These are like Korok puzzles but when I finish one of them it doesn't give a korok.
So I assume I'll have to finish all 3 at the same time.
The problem is that I find only 2 movable stones around. One next to the puzzle and 1 much higher on green ground (the puzzle is in snow).
Anyone remember to this puzzle? Where is the third stone? Or am I doing something wrong?"
