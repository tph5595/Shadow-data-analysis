34194,"First time I died I was actually so embarrassed for myself. I just played Wind Waker about a week ago and never died once so I was feeling pretty confident about my Zelda skills, but this game really brought me back to earth... Ive probably died 50 times already during BOTW! This is something I didnt realize I was missing in Zelda games, the games should be hard! They were getting too easy. Havnt played a Zelda game this hard since the original for NES. "
