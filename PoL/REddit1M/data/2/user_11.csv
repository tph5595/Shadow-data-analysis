A camp of enemies and I just lost all of my weapons? Don't mind if I do"
67958,A lot of the weapons last a while but what happens a lot to make them break easily is hitting the walls or trees while attacking enemies. Your jump attack also damages the weapon when you slam it on the ground. Though you go through a lot of weapons there are also a ton that you find so it isn't usually an issue.
