62644,"Although I do dislike when people say that this game is somehow an antipitome of Skyward sword, because while Skyward sword had downfalls that covered up a lot of its innovation, there was a lot of innovation in there. In combat (besides the motion), in item use, in art style (especially this one), in the design of skyloft, skyward sword really excelled, and BotW manages to build on those things while leaving behind the handholding and other faults. It's pretty great."
