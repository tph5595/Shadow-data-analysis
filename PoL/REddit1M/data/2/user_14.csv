19271,Early spoilers: [There is a Fairy Fountain very early in the game. You can spend a few minutes gathering 15+ fairies and not have to deal with pesky game overs ever again..](/spoiler)
19833,[Take the path in Kakiriko village up the mountain and go about 15 steps past the end of the path. The giant flower is a fairy fountain and you can gather 3-4 fairies every time you visit by walking slowly and grabbing them (don't sneak or run!) Teleport to the shrine that is about 10 feet away from it and repeat](/spoiler)
20261,"More spoilers. This time about armor. Man I'm afraid to post anything without spoiler tags in this subreddit.

[Following the first part of the main story will get you the shirt you see in trailers. It has 5 defense and lets you see the numerical health of enemies. Besides that you can buy armor in shops and upgrade things at the great fairy previously mentioned in the above posts, but I haven't seen anything fantastic yet.](/spoiler)"
54602,You have a main quest to find locations seen in pictures. If you find at least one location you will get the shirt.
