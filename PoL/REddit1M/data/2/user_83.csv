45780,"So I have to ask, are all the weapons in this game made of balsa wood or something?  I've watched maybe 40 minutes of people playing on twitch and it seems like every three swings they get a ""Your weapon badly damaged!"" warning.   

It just seems really obnoxious to not be able to get through a single battle without swapping through three weapons.  Maybe that's an exaggeration, but it would be nice to know you can eventually find or make a solid sword that won't snap in half when you're hit by a slight breeze.   

I even saw one guy get into battle, open his weapon menu, scroll past four or five powerful looking swords, and say, ""No, I don't want to use any of my good weapons on this.""  I'm getting anxious just thinking about it, like they're like elixirs in final fantasy.  You hang onto them all game despite finding hundreds of them cause you just never know..."
