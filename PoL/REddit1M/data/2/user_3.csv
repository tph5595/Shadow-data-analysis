8303,I definitely fell off the tower in the plateau a few times.. those x marks are embarrassing when something like that happens!
92897,I was trying to climb a tower that had thorns and I cleared all of the thorns (or as much as was necessary) but it took me like 10 minutes to climb the tower because I kept pushing the wrong buttons or other just dumb mistakes.. I was fuming lol. It was also like 3 AM so I was probably tired lol
