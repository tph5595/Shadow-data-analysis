56469,"Ive died falling off the Tower in the Great Plateau, getting too close to a remote bomb, falling into the muck next to the magnesis shrine thinking I could make a jump, getting beaten up by a blue bokoblin, drowning a few times, falling off of a rock face I was climbing, and drowning in the pond in Kakariko village. 

I attract death wherever I go. I don't want to see a tally at the end of the game, for the love of Hylia."
