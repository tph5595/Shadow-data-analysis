28432,"i've been living (and dying) for these moments! My method - see camp of enemies, sneak as close as i can, drop a square bomb and whistle to get their attention, train group over bomb and detonate. Run around to regroup the mobs, pull out another bomb and drop with A, rotate camera to see behind me and detonate as the mobs reach the bomb. Takes a minute but it's DAMN fun and no weapon durability loss :)

EXTRA FUN FOR MOBS ON HORSEBACK! Watch me fly!! â˜º"
