Took me at least 20 tries to rush my way up there without getting one shotted immediately "
46932,"Found that fire sword on a tree stump, same one? It's got pretty good durability I tried using it til it broke to see "

There's a tower that's even harder than that one because the enemies can fly. Good luck to you once you get there "
47197,I managed to get up that tower with 3 hearts and a lot of persistence. If you time every single jump right you can avoid every hit. But you gotta be lucky and hope those damn things don't tele above you 
61201,"You can do this with anything if you want to unaggro, it's really cheesy. Just save the game and reload it, the enemies will lose aggro. If you do this on a platform mid climb it'll be a piece of cake. "
61337,"If you have weapons with elemental. Affinities or arrows, those wizards get 1 shotted. They're real easy to take down if you have the right things "
61525,"Is that the shrine that's a ""massive test of strength?"". I got one of those and gave up because I couldn't do it without destroying all of my weapons "
63456,Without giving up too much - is it in the South East of the map? I haven't really explored around there I'm focusing on the North. 
89585,"If I parry right when the lazer shoots at me it'll deflect? I've tried that before but it didn't work, maybe timing was off. "
