76379,"I was fighting the bokoblin hideout on the plateau. I had pretty bad weapons since this is super early in the game, but I defeated all the red ones by making the explosive barrels blow up. The green one was still kicking, but hey, I can take him. He comes out of the hideout with a flaming club, and I get him pretty low. Of course, I got a quarter of a heart left by this point. But one more hit and he's a goner so I don't have to heal.

His club set the grass on fire and when I ran forward to stab him the fire killed me."
