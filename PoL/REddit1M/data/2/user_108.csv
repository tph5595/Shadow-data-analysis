But usually I am just sitting there thinking ""this is going to look so fucking cool"" and when it works the gf tells me how stupid I am and she can't believe it worked. When it doesn't she still tells me how stupid I am. But the real point is I am laughing either way. Death is not a punishment in this game so just go ahead and get creative. "
