68715,"Ocarina of Time 3D has some mild motion controls indeed, but only at times when it's actually useful.  If you've played the original on the N64, you know that if you push the 'up C button' you could look around, but you then used the joystick to move your head around.  Same with firing arrows, you would use the joystick to move your aim around.

In OoT3D, you can move the 3DS around and the view would pan alongside.  It worked really well and made bow aiming much easier.

It reminded me of playing Twilight Princess and aiming with the Wiimote for the first time.  Accuracy is so much improved cause you're not fighting with the joystick.

Agree with others on this thread though, that motion controls for sword fighting didn't add that much, I would be happy to have them but equally as happy to go back to buttons."
