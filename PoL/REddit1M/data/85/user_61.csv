I really want to be a Goron or a Zora again, and please make it a real and final sequel to the Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask series! I miss all the characters from those games and want to know what happened to them!
Edit: Spelling."

121030,"uhmm..... why do you think that? I'm not saying make Majoras Mask 2 blahblah, I'm saying continue it in the aspect and feel that Majoras Mask and Ocarina of Time had, it would actually be a huge hit..."
127109,"Well Majoras Mask was a sequel to Ocarina of Time, so it's obvious I didn't mean it like that. Even though Majoras Mask was amazing it sort of left me empty to where everyone went, I wanna know where all the characters like Navi or Princess Ruto are now and I miss playing the Ocarina.."
