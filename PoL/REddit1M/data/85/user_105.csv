I actually think Ocarina was the perfect balance. TP was dark and I'd say that is a close second to the N64 games. Parts of Ocarina were darker than TP but other parts weren't dark at all, just not bright and cheesy. Skyward Sword wasn't so bad aesthetically, but I really prefer the mood in games like Ocarina, Majora, or even Twilight.

The E3 Tech demo was great, too."
