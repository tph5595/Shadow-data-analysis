70793,"I wish they would move as far away from Skyward Sword as possible. In my opinion that game was a dark spot on an otherwise perfect 3D Zelda legacy. The unemotional, robotic way in which the story progressed, the backtracking to previously explored dungeons to fluff the game time, and the art style (though that is a minor complaint) all lessened my enjoyment of the game. It felt like a Hollywood movie; mass produced and designed to appeal to the widest swath of people possible. And that's just not a good game. I want this next game to be developed by people who actually care enough to put a heart into the game. What I don't want is a board room full of executives re-doing Skyward Sword because it made money, and shoehorning all these new Wii U without a thought given to whether or not they SHOULD, just so that they can claim the game is ""revolutionary"". Everything in this article felt wrong to me; all that talk of ""appealing to casual and hardcore gamers alike"" is so very, very worrisome.  "
