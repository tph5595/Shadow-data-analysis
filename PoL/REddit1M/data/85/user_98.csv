73251,"I'm honestly pretty skeptical about this. Not in that I disbelieve what I hear, but I'm not sure what I'm hearing adds up to a good Zelda game.

To me a good Zelda game is synonymous with having an interesting world just begging you to explore it. We haven't really seen a world like that since Wind Waker, IMO. In fact Skyward Sword was almost as bad as the DS games in this regard.

Plus, I don't really know that super long dungeons are even a good idea. Length isn't really what makes a good dungeon. Good dungeons have a strong theme, good level design, clever puzzles. I feel like if I end up spending 2-3 hours in the same place I'm going to just get tired of it. 

Everything else looks good. I love the Demon Souls style of online play, but I hope they have a good way to explain it. And 2014 release date? Yea, doubtful."
