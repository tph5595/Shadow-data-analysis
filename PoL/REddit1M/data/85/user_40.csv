31125," “The Wii U Zelda stuff you saw at E3 2011 was just a tech demo, nothing else. I’ve seen none of that in the real game. The tech demo was even made by an entirely different team with an older engine”.


I'm..crying... It was perfect. I don't want to play another cartoon. I just tried to start SS again (I've 100 percented it) and I just can't enjoy it. You literally can't go for 3 minutes of gameplay without being interrupted. everything is so light and happy that you don't have the same sens of impending doom that you get from other games. I just want my Ocarina back. Is that so much to ask."
31312,"Agreed, most of the time you just end up waving the wiimote around frantically so fter a while your hand starts to ache. It might be better to implement very precise sword controls at times like in part of a boss fight but revert to more simplistic controls during regular gameplay."
31414,Yeah I'm depressed about that too.
31536,"Yeah, what sweet spot. I almost felt like I was playing it out of obligation. It didn't feel nearly as epic as Twilight."
31616,"I'd love to see that happen but I don't know. OOT was a true, once in a lifetime, masterpiece."
31717,Man they got it perfect in the demo if you ask me. They know that's what we want but they feel like it's more important to market to kids as young as 10 so they aren't going to play to the die hard fans. It's a catch 22.
32157,"Well that's another thing... context. When I brought OOT home for the first time, what I experienced is indescribable. I don't think I'll ever feel that way again so I must admit I'm immediately critical about anything new that comes out."
