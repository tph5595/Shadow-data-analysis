Then again, I also didn't have terribly much trouble with the motion controls, found the story and characters fresh and exciting for the first time since Wind Waker, and was generally pleased with the beginnings of a crafting system, so mileage may vary, I guess."

The pastel, almost-painted style, I felt, lent to the game's believability in a certain way. When I look at Skyward Sword, I don't think, ""This is a video game-ass video game."" I see a colorful world being represented by a skilled artist, the same as when I see an actual painting. Sure, it doesn't look hyper realistic, and it's not like I'm standing in that world, but it gives me the overall impression of an actual, cohesive world.

This is in opposition to practically every other 3D Zelda game but Wind Waker, and it certainly gives me a much better impression than Ocarina of Time ever did."

I mean, I don't think it's the golden apple handed down by Aphrodite, but I'm curious to hear your counter points to actual praise of game (as opposed to arguing against the perceived notion that people think it's a masterpiece without flaw)."
