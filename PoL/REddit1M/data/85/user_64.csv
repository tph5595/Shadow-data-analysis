49133,"To me, WW's art style worked because it was aq ""child-like"" cell-shaded style for a plot where the main characters were children. It was all very sweet adn the art syle fit that.

TP's style was more rugged and realistic, because there were some darker elements in there. The tone of the story was a lot more adult (albeit, not as adult as we're used to in gaming these days).

SS's style was bright, beautiful and clear. The elements to this story strongly involved the relationship between Zelda and Link, as well as other characters. It was a person-based story, which we haven't seen much of in previous games (except between Link and Aryll). Also, you could harldy have a sky-based game with so-called ""dark"" style. 

If the same style is going to be used in this new game, I assume it's because they will be following this new tactic of employing emotional investment in the characters and their relationships, or else it will have a similar motif."
