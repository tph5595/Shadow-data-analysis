9655,"I read an interview with miyamoto that said they'd gotten a lot of mixed feedback on SS controls. From what I read it seems that they were considering not doing that again.

and since it looks like the wii u is gonna have a completely different control scheme than the wii, my guess would be they're not gonna bring back the SS controls.
