65821,"it sounds amazing. the only thing i don't like the sound of is the skyward sword art style. i feel like i'm the only one who really hated the wind waker/twilight princess hybrid they created. i really liked the graphics of the e3 demo, but they've confirmed it isn't going to look like that. it's a petty thing, but i really like the hd graphics of twilight princess, and while the wind waker is one of my favorite games, i much prefer more realistic graphics. alas, this sounds like it will have a lot of the things missing from skyward sword and by the looks of it, they're veering away from stupid motion controls and going back to traditional, which i like."
66232,"i agree that skyward sword had a great and in-depth story (possibly one of the best) and it had a much better story and character development than twilight princess (midna being an exception of course) but i found it very hard to enjoy the game's story because of the pushing of the motion controls. we get it. this game has motion controls. yet the whole game, you're just being told how great motion controls are and constantly having to use them for everything, even when it's unnecessary. my only problem with any zelda game is when they add something unnecessary that not only doesn't add to the storyline, but detracts from it. i think the motion controls did this to skyward sword and i would have enjoyed it a lot more if not for that."
66343,"i agree, which is why after i finished the game, i would have given it a solid B. it had amazing attention to story and character development, but it was at the cost of enjoyable gameplay and less-than-desirable graphics/art style imo. i was fine with fi, i mean we all got through navi and tatl, right? she just popped up a bit more often than she should have, that's all."
66474,"i really hope they don't go with motion controls. i've never played it, but i heard ocarina of time 3d had mild motion controls. it sounded dumb, but like i said, i've never played it. i think it might be able to work with the wii u controls, but i agree. trying the same motion controls as skyward sword with a tablet would be a mistake. it's way too big and bulky and in no way versatile enough for those kind of movements."
66660,"it makes sense, and it'd make mostly everyone happy, but having to develop the game around the versatility of extensive motion controls and very limited motion controls would probably be very difficult. but then again, i'm no game developer."
66923,"it's not that i'm lazy. obviously the tennis game on wii sports is more fun for me than mario tennis on the n64. because it more makes sense for a game like that to have motion controls. but games like zelda don't need motion controls to make them more interactive and immersive, cuz they already are. it was dumb to put motion controls in zelda imo cuz most people i know can't do the things link can do. most people know *can* play tennis, or bowling, or box, etc. and even some mario games make sense to have motion controls (i personally loved super mario bros. wii) but zelda is an adventure game with lots of puzzles and complicated combat. i just really think more traditional controls work better for the zelda series. they always have."
66990,"i know i would, but i actually think a good amount of people would go for the motion controls. i mean hell, enough of them adored them in skyward sword. i hated them, but a huge amount of people praised it for being ""so innovative"""
66999,that's what i'm saying man...
67272,"exactly. it seems like nintendo's afraid of introducing a new art style. it's probably because of the awful feedback the wind waker got before it was released (i thought it was great from the start, but i was in the minority) i loved twilight princess's art style because it was detailed, but it wasn't just an hd version of ocarina of time. it was very unique (i especially love midna and everything about the twili. it all looks beautiful) i personally did not like skyward sword's graphics, because it looked like twilight princess done with the wind waker's graphics, and it just looked wrong. i loved how ghirahim, impa, zelda, even groose looked. link looked dumb, and i think fi could have been done slightly better (less like the fairy queen from the wind waker if nothing else) i just think nintendo is too willing to change the wrong things (like controls and overall gameplay) and not ambitious enough when it comes to plot elements and art style."
67407,"i hope so. twilight princess got my hopes up so much by being rated T. to this day, i'm not sure why it was. it's no scarier nor more violent than ocarina of time or majora's mask. the only thing that seemed worthy of a T rating were the shadow beasts, and ganondorf constantly talking about blood (i found that annoying. he shouldn't have to insistently convince us he's evil)"
67499,"i guess not. if it *is* a direct sequel, i might be able to get on board with it. in spite of my hatred of skyward sword's art style and link's voice, i would like to see how skyloft turned into hyrule, and see the new races (gerudos, zoras, gorons) start to arise. it could be done really well, or not well at all."
67571,"that i can agree with, i just don't want to see skyward sword's graphics again. something similar would be alright i guess, but i miss originality."
67634,you mean the one for the gamecube? i actually thought that one looked a little weird. i'm glad they did the wind waker then waited til twilight princess to do the more adult graphics.
67737,"i definitely agree. the wind waker was beautiful, and one of my favorite zeldas. however, i'm not 9 years old anymore, and i'd personally prefer a game that was more fitted to an older age group. most younger kids don't really like zelda anyways because they don't get a lot of the subtle themes and some of the puzzles, dungeons, even combat are too hard for them (hell, i have trouble from time to time, and i'm nearly 20)"
67774,THANK YOU! i also hated his lesbian haircut and his ridiculous voice.
67902,"same here. NINTENDO, Y U NO STOP BEING UNORIGINAL?!"
67944,"exactly. i found myself trying to make myself like skyward sword, which disappointed me greatly because it was literally the first and only time i ever had to do that for a zelda game."
68044,"the only one? i mean not so much anymore, but i always felt like i was the only one who didn't like it (obviously still don't) skyward sword gets way more praise than it deserves imo and i honestly think it was hyped up just because it was released on zelda's 25th anniversary and there was so much talk of zelda already."
68112,"the gratification crystals were bullshit. it's the same concept as the notebook in majora's mask, but i thought it was dumb that when people were happy, they ejaculated little stars. "
68282,"this is exactly why i think it'd cause more harm than good, because i'd probably just end up ignoring the hints anyway, cuz that takes away from the whole experience of playing the game for me. i like figuring things out for myself."
68528,"that's the thing. i don't think zelda can ever appeal to both the casual and the hardcore gamer. ocarina of time and the wind waker are the only ones i've seen do this, and that was only to an extent. i couldn't agree more with the rest of your points. skyward sword was way too childish for my tastes. people always bring up the wind waker, but it was still pretty adult in some areas. the earth temple was really creepy and i jumped when i first saw a redead. i had a very hard time getting through the wind temple, as well as some of the things you have to do to get the triforce shards. skyward sword was way too easy, but hard in all the wrong areas (it shouldn't have to take me 10 minutes to kill one lizalfo..)"
68561,dafuq did i just read?
68640,"i can get on board with the other two but twilight princess and skyward sword were in no way better than ocarina of time. i'm not even speaking from nostalgia, ocarina of time is just a great game, just like the wind waker and majora's mask."
68679,"motion controls aren't new. maybe it was revolutionary for zelda, but not for the better."
68738,"the gamepad seems like a mistake to me, like they're trying to make us all play the ds. however, it's a step up from motion controls, so i'm alright with it."
68813,"no time to explain, just get in the tardis..."
68861,"as long as there's a lot to do, i see no problem"
69190,"this is ridiculous, and exactly why gamers of other franchises like the elder scrolls, gta, and call of duty don't take zelda seriously as a game. nintendo needs to get off its high horse of needing to make literally ***everything they make*** family friendly. i seriously have no problem with making the bulk of their games family friendly, i understand that it's the only gaming platform that's really willing to do that, and hell one of them has to. but seriously, zelda does not have to be family friendly. that's what the mario games are for (not bashing, i love mario games) if you want to make a light-hearted, family-friendly zelda game, do it, but don't try to make everyone happy, because you won't, and you'll most likely piss off everyone."
69257,"i felt this way in both ocarina of time and skyward sword. the wind waker and twilight princess were the only versions of hyrule that felt real (except of course when the king of red lions said, ""we need to turn around"" when you reach the end of the map)"
69312,"couldn't agree more. over the years, nintendo has become much less about actual quality and much more about marketing and taking all of our money. the worst part is that it's working..."
69344,HA! TRUE! i was just about to say that!
69543,"i'd actually enjoy a multiplayer zelda, maybe designed kinda like gauntlet legends, but it'd be damn near impossible to design *just* right seeing as you'd have to keep link the main hero. (though i thoroughly enjoyed the multiplayer aspect of harry potter and the goblet of fire) four swords adventures did perfectly with this, apart from the fact that you needed 3 gameboy advances to play it with your friends. oh, and have you seen news about [the latest in multiplayer zelda?](http://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Zelda-Battle-Quest.jpg)"
69593,NO MAJORA'S MASK SEQUEL! IT'S PERFECT WITHOUT ONE!
69629,"that's what ruined skyward sword for me. every three seconds, it seemed like the game was saying to me, ""BEE TEE DUBBLES DID YOU KNOW YOU WERE PLAYING WITH MOTION CONTROLS?!"""
69687,"yeah, i loved faron woods in twilight princess, but it was a bit too small. that's the only thing i liked about faron woods in skyward sword. it was really big and full of lots of exploration, it just looked retarded."
69756,"i worry about that too, but i think they've heard people's complaints about ocarina of time and twilight princess being too empty. i honestly think they'll fix that, but then again, they didn't in skyward sword..."
69829,"i could see this working, but it sounds too much like two of my least favorite controls: ds and wii motion+"
69992,"i agree that twilight princess's art style was pretty unoriginal in some areas, as was ocarina of time and majora's mask. but in the areas it *was* original, it looked really good. a prime example is midna. she looked realistic, but not too realistic, and she was really original."
70051,"okay, well that  being said, i could get on board with controls similar to the 3ds"
77973,"i know, but some people think that hyrule field didn't have enough to do. i'm not one of those people, but i can see why one might think this."
78554,"the wind waker *is* a beautiful game and i'll probably start playing it again soon at age 19. i just meant to say that repeating such a child-like art style can be risky if you don't give the game at least *some* adult themes (my personal opinion) what i didn't like about skyward sword was that it looked and felt like a coloring book. everything was spoon fed to me like i wouldn't get it or something, and most puzzles were very easy to figure out (just not so easy to execute) skyward sword's puzzles and dungeons were easy, but the controls made everything more difficult than it should have been. the wind waker had very difficult puzzles and dungeons, but the controls were simple. i much prefer this method of gaming, because it makes the gamer have to think instead of having to try over and over again when he or she already knows what to do.

the wind waker is perfectly suitable for an adult to enjoy, i would just prefer a different art style, because typically (typically, not always) with a childish and light-hearted art style comes a really childish game which just isn't enjoyable for me. the wind waker was able to avoid this, whereas i think skyward sword did not."
86964,"i guess i can agree with that. while the cartoony art style makes them more original, i would much prefer something that looked maybe a bit darker, and slightly more detailed, like how the fake trailer for the majora's mask game looked."
97077,"not sure. maybe a few more enemies, or even some NPCs"
108874,"the concept of the masks is fine to bring back, just continuing or re-hashing the story of majora's mask in any way is a bad idea if you ask me."
111646,"twilight princess wasn't quite as big as the wind waker's world, but it was much bigger than both ocarina of time and skyward sword's worlds. it had 6 provinces, each that were about the size of the entire map of ocarina of time"
111663,"on an unrelated note, i love your username :3"
112618,"* does it have a good story?

yes, a great one at that. however, it was a bit slow-moving at some points. the only part i really remember being excited was when [impa rescues zelda from ghirahim after the lanayru mining facility](/spoiler) and when [ghirahim sends the horde of enemies after you in the sealed grounds leading up to the final battle with him](/spoiler)

* did it pay attention to character development?

yes. much more than any zelda game i've ever seen. most characters were given the same amount (if not, more) of attention to development as midna was in twilight princess (one of my favorite characters) i especially loved groose's transformation, and how much zelda matured after [she found out she was the goddess, hylia](/spoiler) impa was also a great character, and i LOVED ghirahim as a villain. link's been better, but was decent. my only complaint in the department of characters was the cop-out that was demise. just like ganondorf in twilight princess, he was not threatening, he just came out of nowhere and talked constantly about blood and darkness and death and expected us to cower before him. i definitely feared ghirahim more than him.

* did it have amazing music?

yes. again, one of the best soundtracks i've heard in a zelda game.

* did it pay a great attention to aesthetic dungeon design?

again, one of the best i've seen. however, the puzzles were a bit too easy at most points and some of the items seemed a bit useless (the gust bellows) i found i could get through every dungeon in one sitting each (maybe i'm just getting better at these games) but i remember in previous games, i'd actually get stuck and have to come back to a dungeon, which i liked

* did it have spot-on controls that innovated zelda's gameplay for the better?

this is where people lose me. i really disliked the motion controls. before you infer that i just didn't do it right, i was able to master it pretty well after a while. however, the difficulty of the motion controls paired with the increased amount of damage enemies were able to inflict on link made it so it would take a good 10+ minutes to kill just two lizalfos. it was ridiculous. not to mention the fact that any time you even moved the nunchuk, link would raise his shield or do a spin attack. aiming the sword and getting just the right angle for the ghirahim battle was also far too tedious. motion controls are great, and the wii motion+ was much more accurate than the previous controls, but i just don't think they belong in zelda games. 

* did it have a highly original art style that was aesthetically pleasing and easily conveyed the tone of the game?

i didn't care for the art style. it was a weird hybrid of the wind waker and twilight princess that didn't work. faron woods was an eyesore, and the bokoblins and keese looked ridiculous. the dungeons looked beautiful, but that was about where it stopped. demise looked really dumb, like a 7-year-old boy's fanart of an OC after he watched too much dragon ball z. link looked like a lesbian with his weird hair and overly-detailed lips. it also didn't help that his voice sounded like twilight princess link on crack. this was also present in the tone of the game, one minute it was trying to be serious, tugging at your heart strings (""i'll always be your zelda"" and ghirahim's first appearance) but then it'd be ridiculously light-hearted that seem childish and almost condescending (much like how the game spelled everything out for you via fi) like moments with the people of skyloft, the kikwi, the water dragon, etc.

those are my thoughts on skyward sword. after i finished it, i decided i'd give it somewhere between a B and a C. it had some really great elements, but the negatives were so prevalent that they really detracted from the game for me (the pushing of the motion controls did this the most)
