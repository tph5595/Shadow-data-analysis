72212,Really? Link was weird looking in that game. I didn't like his appearance in SS at all.
72413,"If it really will have huge scale dungeons and what not, including a forest, it was just *begging* to have graphics more like Twilight Princess.

I love all Zelda games, but Skyward Sword's graphics need to go. They fit Skyward Sword's very small gameplay areas, but if there are going to be huge sprawling forests, we need some effing natural beauty all up in here, not watercolors."
