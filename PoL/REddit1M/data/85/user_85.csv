65710,"I know I'm going to get downvoted into oblivion for saying this, but that whole article seems, I don't know, a bit sensationalized?  I understand it is from a ""reliable"" source, but this so-called source ""revealed"" that Nintendo would have an online social network and achievements.  I'm pretty sure anybody could have predicted that.  Everybody pretty much knew it was coming. 

And to say that this is going to be the ""biggest, best zelda game evarr!!11!"" is also kind of a no-brainer.  Of course it is.  Every new Zelda game gets bigger and looks better than the last.  And don't forget, Nintendo also said that SS was going to be the most innovative Zelda game ever, and judging from the comments here, the reaction seems a bit mixed.

I hope it's awesome, but that article is kind of just over-sensationalized, pandering, rumor-mongering, and ultimately, poor journalism.  "
