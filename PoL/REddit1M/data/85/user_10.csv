I was hoping for something similar to the tech demo... With less glowing..."

But one thing I love about the Zelda series is the constant art style changes. TPs graphics were great for TP, (those were my favorite, though, I would love to see something similar again) WW's were great for WW, and SS's were spot on for SS. 

I just like Nintendo experimenting with new things. :)"
