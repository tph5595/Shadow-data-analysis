15548,"I am not getting up hopes up yet. they say as many dungeons as previous games...so does that mean 12 or 5? how close is the art style going to be to skyward? while i did like the light hearted feel id rather it be like that picture at the bottom of the article, not photo-real but still mature and serious looking. and how are they going to make it appeal to casual and hardcore? will they have a decent difficulty curve like old games, where anyone can beat the first few dungeons but kids may not actually be able to finish because it actually gets challenging? and i pray to god they ditch that whole ""constantly redefine every item we pick up have fi tell us every single thing that is happening schtick"". The past few zeldas have been good, but if they claim an epic I want it to actually follow through"
