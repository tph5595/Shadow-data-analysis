And honesty, I don't think that the tablet will be as great as they're hyping it up to be. It seems costly, (I can't imagine buying second tablets will be cheap) but seeing as the article doesn't cover exactly *what* the new features are going to be I guess that I'll just have to wait and see.
But those were just my post-CREAM-PANTS-AND-EVERYTHING-NEAR-ME thoughts."

My only two problems with it was that when they announced that you'll be able to point the sword wherever you want, that it was rather limited compared to my expectations. The other was that I found I ***really*** need to get a wireless nun-chuck because I almost made myself bleed from whipping it around."
30788,It appears that their source is considerately solid. It's stated that the site has faith in the source and seems to be that they've certainly seen the game (at least what they've got so far).

30963,This will easily be one of maybe three reasons I'll be buying a Wii U.
