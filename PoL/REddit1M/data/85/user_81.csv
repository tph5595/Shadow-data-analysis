Maybe it'll be like the DS where you swipe on the touchpad to do sword strikes, but I hope not. I kind of just want to go back to button pressing for sword action (if we're to use the gamepad in playing this new game)."
70076,"I think, if it's used correctly, the gamepad will make playing Zelda a much more rewarding experience. There are SO many things you can do with it. Of course, the most obvious thing to me is to allow you to use the gamepad as your item depot, where you can just tap an item on the gamepad and you will have it available for use immediately. One of the very few things I dislike about a lot of the Zelda games is constantly having to pause and select, then re-select items. It breaks the sense of immersion for me. 

I think that Skyward Sword did an excellent thing in this regard, using the radial and not stopping the action while you had it up. I loved being able to check out my items as I was running to a destination, and I thought that it added a real urgency to item choosing.

Also, you can have maps, hearts, basically everything on the gamepad, which may eliminate any HUD on the TV. I think THAT would be the best thing for this game."
