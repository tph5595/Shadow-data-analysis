75081,"&gt; however, i'm not 9 years old anymore

I'm not sure what you're trying to say. You're admitting you think WW is beautiful. If it's beautiful, what does it matter that you're not 9 anymore? Do you think it's not okay to be an adult and think WW is beautiful? Or to like WW despite the fact that it's not a ""proper"" adult game?"
75302,"I think they could definitely go for full on cel-shaded again and still achieve a ""dark"" look. Not all cartoons are colorful, after all. "
75615,"I don't think we needed anyone to debunk it for us to figure out none of this is true. The two ""scoops"" that site had broken before (achievements, online network with social aspect) were things anyone could've guessed. It's just way too much information for this early on in development, and a lot of it honestly just reads like fanbait."
75843,"Yeah, I guess the people who like ""dark"" Zelda started with OoT? Even that wasn't really dark until the very end. A lot of the design of the game, especially the character design, was cartoony as well.

I think the Zelda formula was really laid down with LttP, and that is definitely bright and colorful. I think WW, for beeing so cartoony, is closer to the look of the classic 2D Zeldas than either OoT or TP."
76886,"If Wind Waker wasn't such a milestone for me as a gamer, I think I would definitely consider Skyward Sword the best 3D Zelda. The story is just so much more well-paced and fleshed out than any of the other 3D games. The characters were also very well written.

Ghirahim is my favorite villain so far. He's not the most physically imposing character, but he's just off-the-rails psychologically. He's got an actual personality, not just a brooding cookie cutter villain like some of the Ganons have been, so you get a real look into his psyche. The deranged evil actually comes from somewhere, it isn't ""just so."" They do a switchup with him at the end, but it wasn't a huge letdown like Zant was in TP.

Also, the actual dungeon/temple design is much better than it's been in any of the other 3D Zeldas. Going back and playing OoT, I realized how much it was a direct 3D translation of what they'd established (and worked) in 2D. Everything felt boxy and rectilinear--straight hallways, with flat floors, walls, and ceilings, everything at a 90 degree angle. Everything felt artificial, even when the setting was supposed to be organic, like the inside of a tree or a fish. I know some of it was the limitations of the N64, but a lot of it was simply that they didn't know how to design for 3D yet. Skyward Sword, by contrast, was much more naturalistic. Just look at the Great Tree in SS and the Deku Tree in OoT; in SS it feels like an actual tree, not just a tree-shaped building. Overall, SS felt less ""constructed"" and more like a fully realized, living world. And this was all in spite of the colorful, cartoony art style.

Anyway, I could go on and on.

TLDR: you're not the only one."

&gt; everything was spoon fed to me like i wouldn't get it or something

That's my biggest gripe about SS. I think Nintendo's done a lot of customer surveying and has been dissatisfied with the number of people who actually played previous Zelda games all the way through, so they implemented a hint system disguised as a character and just completely overdid it, in order to accommodate what they felt was their main audience (the one that made the Wii so successful). What I think they forgot is that Zelda has always been a game for core Nintendo gamers (though not necessarily ""hardcore"" in the way most people define that term), so the person who bought Wii Sports Resort isn't necessarily the same person who'll buy a Zelda. Obviously the two audiences aren't mutually exclusive, but I think Nintendo has just really underestimated its customer base in order to keep the most casual of the casuals happy. I really hope that next time they give you an option to turn off the helper character, or at least tone it down or give you the option to only bring it up when you actually need it.

I think what I've described above is what you've called ""childish"" aspect of how SS played. I don't think that's the right term, but I get what you're saying.

As for the ""coloring book"" art style, I think it isn't entirely a product of Nintendo's desire to make its games accessible to as many people as possible. Maybe accessibility was a concern when they settled on the art style, but if anything, a cartoony look in a game is more niche than a ""dark"" style like TP, which I'd say is more palatable to a mainstream audience. Just look at WW, SS, Psychonauts, or the Rayman Origins games and they've all performed below expectations commercially, if not outright bombed."
91307,"I definitely agree with you; I said ""in spite"" of the colorful, cartoony style because I feel that some people equate ""realistic"" graphics (I put that in quotes because I don't feel even TP or OoT have been realistic) with immersiveness, cohesiveness, and believability, but that's not necessarily true."
