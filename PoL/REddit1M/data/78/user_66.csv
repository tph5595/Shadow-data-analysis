12024,"I tend to agree. There's too much to comment on right now, but one thing I will say is that why shouldn't people buying Nintendo games expect graphics that compete with everyone else? I mean, they're definitely not used to them because Nintendo's graphics have always been behind, but sometimes it seems like they're not even trying anymore.

I'm not a huge gamer anymore, I don't have any next-gen consoles yet, but when I do get an XBone I'll play Dark Souls 3 and appreciate a game that rewards me for exploring my world and learning about my enemies rather than hold my hand the entire way to the end of the game. And I'll appreciate how good it looks, too."
