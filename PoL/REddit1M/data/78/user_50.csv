9420,"No word on price yet. I'm hoping it's discounted, but it depends on how much content is actually in the game probably."
9591,"They announced at the Treehouse presentation that it does have its own story, but it's an extremely light story from the little sneak peek they gave us.

Apparently the game takes place in a foreign kingdom where the king's daughter is cursed to wear some horrible outfit, and as long as the curse is active, she can't take these clothes off. And because the town is so fashion-sensitive, everyone sees this curse as a really big deal. So the king has called for heroes to come to the kingdom and break the curse (presumably for some reward).

The original Four Swords *did* have an actual storyline, and it was actually a debatably more serious story than this game... :P"
9834,I actually am interested in whether or not this game is supposed to be canon.
10991,"They also said that there are more outfits in the game than just what they showed off at E3, so that seems to imply that you'll collect additional outfits as you progress through the game, so it does seem like this will be at least a *little* more substantial than FS (unless the game just features the same 4/5 randomly-generated levels like FS, and every time you defeat one you get a new outfit), but it remains to be seen whether or not it'll get up to FSA level or beyond."
32174,"I thought I saw the trailer say at one point that everyone needed their own copy of the game to play, so the fact that the Download play was announced after that makes me think the Download play will be a pared down version of the actual game (unless I just misread the original disclaimer)."
32265,"New: yes. 

Zelda game: yes.

For 3DS: yes.

Canon: ...Probably? But we don't know for sure yet."
33782,"Well, Hyrule Warriors did have its own story set in the Zelda universe, but that game wasn't canon. TFH also has its own story set in the Zelda universe (as well as dungeons, puzzles, boss battles, etc.), but we don't know yet if Nintendo considers it canon.

The leading theory right now is that if it says ""The Legend of Zelda:"" before the subtitle, Nintendo is going to consider it canon, and this game does have the main title prefacing the subtitle, so that's why I say ""Probably"", but Nintendo didn't officially say one way or the other."
36306,"Yeah, that is typically the case. So I guess we're just meant to assume its canon unless told otherwise."
47978,"There is a story, and there is a hub town, but beyond that it's currently unclear whether there's any overworld outside of the hub town or if it's just straight to the dungeons (but most likely it's the latter given the emphasis on multiplayer co-op dungeon play)."
