341,A little meh about it
3493,Multiplayer centric titles like this don't interest me much. I don't know that many people who would play a game like this with me and its not the same online. There's also not that much exciting to the gameplay. You can stand on each other? Okay. It doesn't have the same spirit as the main series.
18136,Yeah but the fact they decided to make those games instead of the ones people were interested in says a lot.

I had a good opinion of Nintendo going into the conference (not hype, just confidence in the way they were handling dlc) but after seeing this not so much. They don't have a line up while everyone else is fully stacked.  It's depressing."
