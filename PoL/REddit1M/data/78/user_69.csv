12475,"&gt; ""Metroid Prime"" and Animal Crossing U, Nintendo has lost and good will they had from me.

well luckily those werent metroid prime 4 and animal crossing u, so no reason to lose faith"
12598,metroid fan here. was fucking hyped as hell for what is essentially hunters with coop.
12638,"i thought people liked four swords, and have been hoping for a new one for years? plus it even has online. no one thought four swords would ever get online"
12848,they werent shoe horned in. minish cap had the four sword after all.
12905,"there are many people saying this game looks like crap, then proceed to ask for a ALBW styled game. all idiots."
12963,"so zelda 1, twilight princess, OOT, majora's mask and windwaker all sucked then?"
13022,go to /r/starfox for some decent discussion. everyone there likes the n64 style graphics
1165627,"GBA one i can understand, but get 3 friends and play the GC one. its really fun that way. super boring by yourself though."
1166317,how so? 
1166563,four swords adventures was also story driven. it just wasnt single player focused.
1167076,"so you are saying that you hate a game, even though you saw NOTHING of it? how is that even remotely alright? you are making a decision with absolutely 0 information."
1167420,"no, but people seem to only care about the main series games, and everyone likes to think those are main entries, so the wii u/3ds wont possibly get those games, when they are not main games, so its still possible."
1167473,"because its blind hate. i saw one person try and convince everyone the star fox graphics were bad by comparing them to mario kart 8 graphics, which are of the same quality. he even said mk8 has AA, which it does not. it was really bad."
1176830,"the guy was trying to convince people mk8 had AA, and star fox didnt. you can even see the textures in mario kart are of the same quality as those in star fox. its not blind hate, its just stupidity."
