37744,"It's fucking stupid how much hate e3 brings about, isn't it? I loved everything but the amiibo stuff. Sure, i would have preferred ""better"" Zelda news, but it is obviously to hold the fans off. anouma even made a point of saying these weren't his zelda games. and metroid looks decent. not what anyone wanted, but a sequel to hunters. Probably another hold over title. "
