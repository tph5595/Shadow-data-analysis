The worst part was that there was virtually no narrative to what they've showed in the Direct. The only unique things so far are the outfits and the stacking mechanic. The rest pretty much looks like Four Swords minus one player and with a visual update."

I think the disappointment is less with the multiplayer, and more with the fact that it looks a lot like FS."

Maybe Triforce heroes will have a new map, if we're lucky."
24927,"Calm down, you seem a little defensive. Not every Zelda fan is going to buy or like Triforce Heroes, and you need to come to terms with that.

Additionally, if you think all Zelda games are as similar to eachother as Triforce Heroes is to FS, then I'd think you haven't played enough of them. "
