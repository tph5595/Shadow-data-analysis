1826,"didnt say any one did. and bite me. i wasnt rude in asking for a source the first time. you responded sarcastically and i responded in turn. its a nintendo live stream event, until they put up a video theres no back pedaling. it passed so theres no rewinding until after e3. i found a live blog of it though so kiss my ass. you wernt useful anyways."
2474,the thing being i dont care about karma.
2625,"i understand it was just a trailer. i also know please and thank you go a long way but if someone asks a question and you arnt going to be helpful then why answer at all? everyone and their grandma knows e3 is going on right now so of course new game titles are coming from there. thank you for the link, i appreciate it."
2799,"i found it by subreddit hopping. no actual googling helped, thats why i asked."
2881,"no one but people on reddit care about reddit, i rarely post here at all so that doesnt mean much to me, downvotes dont seem to mean anything on this website anyways, and again ""source?"" isnt being rude. "
