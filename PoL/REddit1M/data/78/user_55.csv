And it's coming out in only a few months!"
25766,"That it's coming out in only a few months? Oh, no, I'm not saying that's bad at all. Quite the contrary, actually."
25960,"While the lack of acknowledged narrative beyond an excuse plot worries me, too, I'm going to remain somewhat optimistic and just not trust the trailer myself until I play."
26417,"Er, just gotta say that *Majora's Mask* would like a word with #3."
27618,"*Spirit Tracks* appreciator speaking. It's lonely over here, but like you said, we do exist!"
28071,"The presence of silly elements in a work and said work being serious are not mutually exclusive events.

Unless, of course, you mean to tell me that *The Lord of the Rings* with all of its death and impending doom isn't serious simply because of the presence of Gimli's antics, or that *9 Hours, 9 Persons, 9 Doors* isn't serious simply because of the elevator scene."
28381,"Ah, I see.

Well, I only speak for myself, of course. Narrative/lore/atmosphere is the main reason why I play *Zelda* (good gameplay is something I already expect, really). It's cool if others put gameplay first in their preference, but it's only fair if I make my preferences public, as well, right?"
29267,"Yes, I would. *Emphatically.* Sure, it has its silly moments, and the bright art style is approachable and full of wonder, but that doesn't mean that it doesn't have serious undertones. *Tales of Symphonia* is similar there--very bright art style, very dark undertones. Fact is, silly stuff helps modulate pacing, humanize characters living in harsh situations, and is simply a good way to switch things up and help keep things interesting.

Or instead of listening to me, you can watch this video Extra Credits did. You can skip to 4:00 if you're feeling lazy, but starting from the beginning helps with context, as they give the *Max Payne* series as an example. Plus, it's just informative. It's a good video series. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lzU8wM_S2Ks"
29664,"Haha, it's the *Zelda* fanbase; whatcha gonna do, eh? \^\^;"
29771,Damn straight! :D

For what it's worth, *Phantom Hourglass* is a worthy sequel to *The Wind Waker* in my eyes!"
