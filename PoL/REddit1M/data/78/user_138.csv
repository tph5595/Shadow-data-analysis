47419,"Serious question, why did you get a Wii U if you don't like Nintendo games? I just don't understand why people buy a system even though there's almost nothing on them that they like. It's why I haven't gotten a PS4 yes, I'm waiting for the good games to come out first.

The Wii U has a ton of great games, but it's understandable that not everyone is going to be into them. Just like I'm not into Witcher 3 or Fallout, that's not because they're bad games but because it isn't interesting to me.

Just sell your Wii U, I don't think you're ever going to be impressed with it if you aren't yet."
