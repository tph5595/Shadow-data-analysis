I don't know why they would come out with a bunch of weird party games and amiibo cashgrabs when they could just listen to their fans. I mean, that would likely make them more money in the end, anyway..."
16923,"&gt; Youre a selfish, childish, shit-brain of a fan who lacks reference... It's embarrassing...

Holy shit, way to bring the smackdown"
17476,"I guess so.  I think a lot of this fanbase is comprised of whiny pissbabies anyway. I just wish Nintendo would actually announce something important/cool instead of this stuff because a lot of people are pissed off by it which is giving Nintendo and its fans a bad reputation...

I guess we shouldn't lose hope just yet. I mean, they were doing a lot of things right right before E3 happened. Perhaps we should just wait and see what they have in store..."
