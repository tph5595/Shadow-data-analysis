40297,"We don't know that those titles will ever exist though. You're excusing poor excuses for games by telling yourself the ""real"" ones aren't out yet when in fact you have no guarantee they will ever happen. "
40337,Are you suggesting you shouldn't be able to get a feel for a game from is trailer? Cause I'm pretty sure that's what a trailer is supposed to do. 
40626,"Overall a very lackluster Nintendo E3 offering. Obviously everyone is entitled to their own opinion, but I'd be very surprised if you thought Nintendo's presentation this year was even remotely on par with Sony or Microsoft's or (an even easier comparison) their showing last year.

That's why people are bitter. "
40700,"Maybe it's just me, but the word ""outfit"" just makes me think I'm playing with Barbie dolls. Especially when it's used in the context of striking a pose behind an opening curtain. "
40809,"""Decent discussion""? What makes the negative outlook elsewhere not a decent discussion?"
40918,It's hard to stay continually excited about something we last saw a few minutes of a year ago. 
40959,"I would think  own copy, but I haven't seen it officially confirmed anywhere.

EDIT: [Seems I was happily wrong](http://e3.nintendo.com/games/3ds/the-legend-of-zelda-tri-force-heroes/)! Download Play it is!"
41985,"That'd be fine if that's what they were. They're not. We have fricking Zelda's dress, for pete's sake. "
115457,I haven't seen any of it and I have no interest in seeing any of it - I myself am a perfect example of why Nintendo's piss poor marketing for the title is a bad thing. 
121555,"Edit: Oops, lost track of the game discussed in this particular thread. Most of my comments and harshness were directed much more towards the new ""Metroid"". Zelda wasn't quite as bad by any means but I do think what they showed in the Direct was pretty ""eh, okay"". Certainly not bad but I don't think it built hype either. 

That said - when that trailer is the big announcement for it at the biggest gaming convention in the world? Yeah dude. That's definitely marketing.

In any case, as I said the brunt of my argument was towards Metroid, which I'm just kind of offended by. The 3DS Zelda? Yeah, I'll probably play it, but I'm not excitedly anticipating it or anything at this point. "
122720,"Except this is al we have so far. The marketing we have so far has been relatively poor. (Redacting my previous expression because, as I said, I thought we were talking about a different game). "
123302,"It's enough to judge it so far, which is all I'm doing. "
123670,"...you literally agreed this was marketing two posts before, and now you're saying it's not. I'm done here. "
1167515,"When did I say I hated it? I said I had no interest in playing it from the material I've seen of it so far. You've made the same decision countless times too - since you can't play every game that is released, you have to make judgements and decide what is worth your time based on what you know of the game from marketing. That's why marketing is important. "
1167625,Of course it's still possible. I never said it wasn't. I just said it's also possible that it *doesn't* ever happen. 
1167697,"If you think MK8 and this new StarFox have comparable visuals, you're honestly deluding yourself.

(Sidenote, love how you're calling the negative reception of the graphics ""blind"" hate when it's literally anything but that.)"
