I guess I'm one of the rare people who've played Four Sword multiplayer which is why I'm super excited because multiplayer Zelda is extremely amazing if the level design is as good as it was in FSA."

""Hmm, nintendo's made many a great game in their day, including loads of good Zelda games, but their lineup this year looks disappointing. Well, that's it, good show nintendo but I'm done with you, never trusting you again"" What, are you not going to play the WiiU Zelda? Which is still coming by the way, it's not gone anywhere even if we didn't hear about it today."
