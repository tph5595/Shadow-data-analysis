16777,"Personally, I think the environments look pretty bland and the puzzles look very simple. Granted, we didn't see much, but the repetition of certain mechanics (namely stacking the Links together to make a totem pole) makes it seem like the game will also be mechanically simple. The trailer also didn't show any story or particularly large-scale/impressive moments.

In short, if this trailer was meant to garner interest, it failed for me. The thing I liked most about it was each color Link having slightly different designs."

None of us can speak to the actual quality of the game, so let's not pretend either of us knows otherwise. And I love this series, so I'll probably end up getting it.

But I don't blame people for seeing this trailer and being underwhelmed."
