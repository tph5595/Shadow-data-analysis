I, for one, am incredibly excited at the chance to play a co-op game with friends across the country. There's so many nintendo games that would be so much better with online functionality, and I'm so glad to see that they're moving more in that direction.

It's about time."

I'll admit that a lot of what was shown today was pretty disappointing, but the reason is because Nintendo basically already finished putting out a big wave of long anticipated titles last year. There's really not much left, and the company only has so many resources devoted to churning out enough content to please the endless hunger of the fans.

The entitlement from Zelda purists in this thread baffles me.
