When compared to the other companies this year, it stands on even ground. This has been a disappointing E3 from everyone. For me, the only games that looked worth buying were ones that had already been announced, with the exception of Horizon: Zero Dawn and the co-op Zelda. Still, everyone dropped the ball this year, not just Nintendo."
