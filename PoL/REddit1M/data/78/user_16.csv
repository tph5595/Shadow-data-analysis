2966,"I'm a huge Zelda fan, but this just seems like tat.. very disappointed with this years Nintendo E3 presentation, (I've been looking forward to it all day, I'm in the UK)."

11634,"Where's Punch Out? Metroid? An RPG Mario game? What about a list of up coming eShop games, like Mario RPG or GC games. The only game shown that I'm interested in is Mario Maker. I though Star Fox didn't really look all that great..."
11817,"I got Ryu and co. for Smash, was just playing it there now on the Wii U, (Ryu and Roy are beasts!!). Bar Smash, Mario Kart and me trying to go back and 100% Super Mario 3D World, there's not anything else I own for the Wii U, that I'm gonna jump back on in any hurry. 

That new Zelda for the 3DS looks like a rushed game, not impressed and it will be the only Zelda game that I won't own."
15484,"I don't like the look of that Metroid game, it looks more like the Skylanders thing. I still have Paper Mario Sticker Star and Mario &amp; Luigi Dream Team, that I still haven't played, another one being released sometime in the near future, is not and probably will not be on my radar.

Edit - was there not talk about Retro Studios announcing a new game at E3?"
15591,"I'd rather see a Mario &amp; Luigi cross over game with, say Pac-man, or Zelda, than a Paper Mario cross over. Just seems like they're running out of ideas, which make me feel a bit sad."
15629,"I have four swords for the GC and GBA, I didn't really rate those either tbh."
15966,"I keep buying games for the 3DS, but never actually play them. i always say that I'm not buying anymore handheld Nintendo's because i never play them that much. In the last 2 years I've bought my 3DS, the New Majora's Mask 3DS and about 12 games. 


I also bought Pokemon Yellow back in 2000, that I still haven't played, (I have a good excuse for that though, I just started uni and was partying too much)."
19440,"I highly recommend the DLC for Mario Kart, the new tracks are sweet and the price isn't too bad. As for Smash I paid Â£20 for three characters, (Ryu, Robin &amp; Lucas), 2 extra stages, (4 if you count their omega forms), extra music and Mii costumes, (which I don't really use). So that was a bit more expensive.

I have the Witcher 3 as well on Xbox One, and I haven't done an awful lot in it, but I have been playing for hours. It's a great game. I've ordered Arkham Knight as well, so I should have it by this time next week.

I love my Wii U, but new games, that I would be interested in, are lacking. I'll probably end up getting Mario Maker at launch and may pick up Star Fox and Yoshi next year."
