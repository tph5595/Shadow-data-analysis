11698,"Well, on the one hand I would say that ""it's meant to expand the metroid universe, show that there exists a world outside of Samus's adventures on Zebes"", but on the other hand, it's also ""we have an idea for a game, but it won't necessarily do that well on it's own"", which is how they normally do things. It might be the Metroid of this gen, it might not, we'll have to wait and see. But I don't think I would call it a ""slap in the face"" to release a spin off."
11895,There was a promotion in February last year (or was it this year?) where it was available for 4 days.
12001,Better question: what will this mean for the Hero Cycle?
12088,"Umm, as far as games go I suppose BS The Legend of Zelda (not Ancient Stone Tablets) would be a spin-off. You also have the manga as spin-offs, and the TV show."
12947,"Possibly, but if it doesn't use the four sword it's, ""is it the Hero and his helpers? Why aren't they ""heroes""? Is it 3 heroes? How is that possible? Are they heroes at all? They haven't saved Hyrule."""
13855,"See, that's what we don't know. And that's what I want to find out."
14188,"I feel like it will be, or will try to be. I'm also expecting the fanbase to completely hate it because it dared to focus on dungeon crawling and puzzle solving instead of overworld exploration with plenty of physical rewards that is forced upon the player, not taken by the player's choice."
108372,"Well, based on what they showed in the Treehouse, the trailer is only really showing maybe 1/3rd of the gameplay experience."
108762,"I'm excited for it, because it's a way for me to play the games I love with the people I love. I hope this has multiplayer outside of the dungeons, though. Maybe something like an area based overworld, where you are all in the same area, and have to exit it together to go somewhere else, and can make regular zelda type discoveries in the overworld. I also hope it has more personal progression than just getting more outfits."
119700,"I wouldn't even say there's a line there, I'd say it's more that some games were made with a timeline in mind, and others were made without it being considered. Case in point: releasing Twilight Princess after Wind Waker. The first three were confirmed to be after OoT, as was Wind Waker. Wind Waker and the originals could not take place in the same timeline. Then TP comes along and can't fit before or after the original trilogy either. Nor could it be in the same timeline as WW. It was obviously made without much thought to the timeline that they had at the time."
119943,"How can marketing be piss poor when it was just revealed to exist yesterday? I would not call one trailer the extent of marketing, especially not when it's only one day old."
122034,"I didn't say it wasn't marketing, I said it wasn't the extent of marketing, by which I mean, you can't point to that and say ""this game had piss poor marketing"". Just like I can't point to some of the gratingly high pitched midi instruments of OoT and say ""that game had piss poor sound design""."
123150,"But again, I wouldn't call one trailer that's been out for one day ""the marketing"". One day isn't enough time to do much of anything. Once there has been some time, okay, you can comment on the marketing, but I don't think one day is enough to really judge the marketing."
123503,"Again, not really. Heck, I wouldn't even call the trailer an attempt at marketing, as I see marketing as being ""Hey, you know this game? Go out and buy it."" where as this is ""HEY! There's a new zelda game!"""
123897,"Well, just to be a pedant, I only said that I didn't say it wasn't marketing, I didn't agree that it was marketing. In a sense, yes it is, but in another sense, no it is not. A reveal trailer is not, and never will be, part of the marketing campaign for a game. But in the sense of marketing as awareness raising, then anything that mentions the game is marketing, including the two 30-50 minute play sessions they've broadcast and have available on their channel, as well as all the articles that talk about it, and even this thread."
286705,"It is, but it cannot exist in the same timeline as A Link to the Past or Wind Waker, so it caused the three way split."
