10098,"Besides something like Link's Crossbow training or the Japan-only games like Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland...have there been any true spin offs in Zelda? I would still consider Four Swords to be a main-game for instance. It affects the chronology of the timelines, something the above-mentioned games don't.

Edit: Hyrule Warriors is a spinoff. Still, I don't think Four Swords is considered to be a spinoff, so it's safe to assume that this isn't."
10130,But now you can call Link Zelda and be right!
10181,It's not just this. Most people are just being bitter. The Star Fox thread on /r/games is entirely focused on the graphics. No one is discussing the gameplay. It's really sad since the game looks really fun.
12653,I didn't think about those actually. They're not games though (or an original game in BS Zelda's case). 
14494,You're right. Somehow I forgot that...even though I played it a fuck ton last year.
