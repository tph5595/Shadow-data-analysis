3868,"The only games they showed I'm getting for sure are Star Fox and Fire Emblem. Possibly YWW, and probably Mario &amp; Luigi x Paper Mario. 

I have 0 friends who own a 3DS, so I'll only get Triforce Heroes if the single player doesn't look like garbage, which I'm afraid it will. Constantly switching between 3 characters probably doesn't flow very well, and I think they intentionally didn't really show any of the single player experience because of that.

Why they would make another co-op Zelda perplexes me though. Considering how well ALBW was received, I did expect another 3DS Zelda running in the same engine (kind of like how Spirit Tracks ran on the Phantom Hourglass engine), but not a multiplayer one! Especially since the 3DS is made for playing on the go, where you:

A) Don't have an Internet connection unless you want to hook up your 3DS to your cell phone's 3/4G.

B) Usually aren't playing for more than 10-30 minutes at a time (or however long your bus/train journey takes), which kinda sucks if you need to jump out halfway through a dungeon or whatever.

C) Can't communicate with the people you're playing with.

I'm sure it'll be fun if you played it with friends locally, but why make this? Why give us another multiplayer Zelda which pretty much nobody asked for? If they were fine with making the two DS-games with the same engine, why not just make a new single-player Zelda instead? They know that would sell way better than a multiplayer one, so whyyyyyyyyyy make another multiplayer-focused Zelda? D:

I'm gonna go sulk for a while.

PS. And a multiplayer-focused Metroid for 3DS with the exact same problems mentioned above. What is Nintendo's fascination with online co-op on the 3DS? That stuff belongs on Wii U, not 3DS which is made for playing on the go!"
