6994,Because nobody gives a flying fuck about a multiplayer Zelda game. What a terrible E3 showing.
7945,"That's because you're one of those people with no taste that thinks Nintendo can do no wrong, because your brain lacks the section that allows for frame of references.

There's a reason that nobody mentions Spirit Tracks and Four Swords among the best Zelda games - because they fucking suck. Ok, maybe that was harsh - they are painfully mediocre, just like this newest one is sure to be.

So what did we get this E3 from Nintendo? A Starfox trailer with a gamepad gimmick and Gamecube graphics. An abortion of a Metroid game. And a shitty co-op handheld Zelda. The least Nintendo could've done to appease fans who don't like their shitty games is show a little more of Zelda Wii-U. Nope, just more fucking Amiibos.

Yet MS and Sony give us Uncharted, Halo, Gears of War, Battlefront, Final Fantasy 7, etc

Thanks Nintendo. Just when I think you're on the right track with Mario Kart 8 you go and pull this shit."
9814,"Nobody cares about more 3DS Mario RPG games, as they're generally pretty mediocre. Announce Super Mario RPG 2 and I'll actually start to care. Nobody also really gives a shit about Xenoblade except for the Japanese and weeaboo virgins in the west. 

People want a console Mario. Did we get that? Nope. People want a console Zelda. Any more footage? Nope. People want Metroid. Did we get that? LOL, yeah maybe if Ridley took a steaming hot dump and told Nintendo fans to be excited, I guess you can consider today's announcement to be mindblowing. 

Finally, Starfox literally has GCN graphics and everyone is commenting on that fact.

Whereas, at everyone else's E3, they gave us what we wanted. Everyone wanted more Uncharted, more Halo, and Battlefront footage.

We got The Last Guardian and a FF7 remake. Gears of War 3. Dark Souls 3 was teased. We got a Tomb Raider trailer. We got awesome new IPs like Horizon: Zero Dawn.

We got **Fallout motherfucking 4 and Doom.**

Safe to say, Nintendo had a piss poor showing in comparison."
