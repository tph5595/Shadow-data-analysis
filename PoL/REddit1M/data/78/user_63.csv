11653,"Another strong vote of agreement. With Zelda games I want to take a personal journey. I don't feel like Link is a ""link"" to me if there are multiple others in the same mission."
11923,"Honestly it doesn't feel like a True new Zelda game. If they had released something that was a full new stand alone story based game kind of like how they had Phantom Hourglass and then Spirit Tracks released relatively close together (for a zelda game). That would have been more exciting. The Multiplayer zeldas feel gimmicky (costumes, specifically creating puzzles that one player could solve by themselves and slightly tweaking it so you need to use three people.....) That's not what we are looking for in a new zelda. Put another way, this on feels too silly and off-brand to be a true, serious zelda entry. I feel like I am lying to myself when I start watching this trailer hoping for a regular zelda game."
12051,I feel like it won't really. I think the same was true of the 4 swords games...they didn't REALLY fit into the story....but they were kind of shoe-horned in.
22994,agreed that would be a big improvement
23023,As an extra. The Minish Cap game itself was a story driven single player game.
23172,"1) The ALBW trailer clearly showed an overworld and a villain and alluded to a story. This just seems like a hub world game like Four Swords.
2) Gimmicks in service of and in line with the traditional zelda story. This one is about a world where the people all are very fashion conscious???? This feels about as canon as Hyrule Warriors.
3) Yes"
23265,That is a really interesting bit of trivia and kind of a bummer too :( Thanks for sharing! :)
24228,We will have to agree to disagree. I'm glad you have a game to be excited about. I am disappointed.
