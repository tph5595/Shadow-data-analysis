4900,Wish I had friends who had 3DS's. :(
5506,"Yeah, but there is always something special about playing with people you know. Can't remember the last time I've played with completely random people. Not really my thing that. I love co-op, but I love co-op with people I love. Oh well. We'll see if I can get over it.

Maybe I can just manipulate some new people to become my friends before the game comes out, ha. :D"
6815,"Maybe.

Being a fan of discussion, I usually meet friends and specifically gaming friends online, on discussion boards like Reddit. The reason why I rarely ever meet people in online gaming is that it's not really a platform for discussion. I'm quick to mute anyone with a mic and just get a private skype call going in the background while playing so I can be assured of the people I talk to. 

I hate the idea of being randomly put together with random idiots all across the world to try and solve puzzles and problems without proper means of communication. Doesn't sound fun to me, though I admit that I'm a cynic."
