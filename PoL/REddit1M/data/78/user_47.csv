9009,I have never been this disappointed by a zelda game announcement. Multiplayer zelda has it's place of course but this is just....ehh. It seems very lazy. It's borrowing an idea from two previous games and dumbing it down by removing one player. The reuse of ALBW graphics engine is also pretty lazy.
