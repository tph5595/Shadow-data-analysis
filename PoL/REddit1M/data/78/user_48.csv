12447,"I mean, I agree with you. People don't need to like this nor care about a spin-off. But, like, a lot of people are always bitter about announcements, and rather have things their way when concerning Zelda. That's the kind of stuff that erks me. Just looking through recent threads in this subreddit, it's like, wow people can't be happy with a game announement.

There's some really weird vocal negativity going around today."
