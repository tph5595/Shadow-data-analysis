7057,"&gt;This is definitely not a half-assed game! This is a whole-new Zelda adventure. I wouldn't worry about it.

Not even touching that kool-aid until I hear more about it."
7614,"I would normally give Nintendo the benefit of the doubt, but after watching the trailers for ""Metroid Prime"" and Animal Crossing U, Nintendo has lost and good will they had from me.

They have somehow managed to turn those great IPs into party games...why should Zelda be off the list?"
8168,"I want to believe, but I bought into the hype and Big N cut me deep...

I'm not extremely disappointed by the lack of Animal Crossing U, but find the Animal Crossing x Mario Party with obvious Amiibo cash in to distasteful. It disappointed the big fans of the series and looks like a minimal effort to maximize money by pushing more Amiibo sales.

The Metroid Prime game shouldn't even have that title on it. It could literally be Generic Spaceshooter X and work just as well. I might actually be less upset if that were the case. Instead they gave me Generic Spaceshooter X while dangling the idea of Metroid in my face."
22991,"For now I am off the bandwagon. I have loved them and supported them and defended them for a long time. They just keep doing this. Sure they put out some great games still and I plan on buying them, but the trend lately hasn't been good. Amiibo have gotten out of control. They are out of touch with the fans and for the time being just told all of their Metroid and Animal Crossing fans to go fuck themselves. 

Obviously, they still have time to redeem themselves, but right now they just fell on their face on the biggest stage for gaming. The mood on all the Nintendo subs (which are full of overly optimistic homers) is very bleak. Lots of fans are disappointed and upset. The Nintendo fanbase is small enough already and Nintendo is alienating the remaining few. "
23118,I agree. Nintendo has done nothing to reassure existing fans of their relevance going forward or to win over new fans. They are almost going out of their way to prove they are out of touch. 
25496,"Splatoon, Mario kart, smash bros, and all the respective DLC made it look like Nintendo was starting to adapt to the modern gaming landscape. Then they show us this... Now, they still have great games coming out in the future, but we've known about those for some time now. Nothing new was exciting in the least. "
