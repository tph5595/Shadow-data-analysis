7395,Cause people were expecting so much more from Nintendo. They wanted brand new things all the way. Also half the things presented today were either already known about or leaked to us. Nintendo already said that there wouldn't be a new Mario or Zelda U this E3 so I guess people put their hopes into exciting new projects.
9020,"It may be a new project, but at the end of the day it was a spinoff. It wasn't a full fledge Zelda and that's what people were upset about. While I agree that people are being over dramatic about this game, they're not being fair to it because it's only been just announced."
