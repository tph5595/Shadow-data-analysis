10287,"&gt; They've never let us down with Zelda yet!

I think you're missing the point. I'm sure it'll be a fun multiplayer game. That's not what a lot of people look for in Zelda though. I don't really consider this a new Zelda, just a spin-off really, unless Nintendo gives us true details about a robust single player experience. That's fine for some people, nothing wrong with that at all, but a spin-off Zelda game wasn't enough to lift this showing."
11187,"I mean...look, I'm a huge Zelda fan. But I don't have to like every Zelda spin-off that comes out. Multiplayer spin-off Zelda doesn't interest me, and it seems I'm not alone. I'm not going to dump all over it because I'm not the audience, but it's just not the way I enjoy Zelda. 

Just because Nintendo slaps the Zelda name on it and puts Link in it doesn't mean I'll automatically fall in love, especially based on those videos and available info. I gave HW a chance (and generally enjoyed it) because the core game seemed interesting enough and the fan service was decent. Not getting the same vibe from this. That's okay though. It's going for a different audience."
