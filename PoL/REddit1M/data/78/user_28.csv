4893,I hope there's an actual storyline and explorable world for the game and that it's not just a collection of dungeons like the original Four Swords was. 
10839,"Hm, that's a pretty weird plot. I'm aware that Four Swords did have a story, but that story was very minimal and didn't really impact the game beyond the very beginning and the very end. Everything in the middle is just fighting monsters and collecting rupees. I'm hoping this game is more like FSA, which was multiplayer but still had a world and a story that gradually unfolded as the game progressed."
