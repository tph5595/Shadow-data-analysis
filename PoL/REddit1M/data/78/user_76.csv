I am really angry with peoples reaction to things like metroid prime and not giving it a chance because it wasn't like known metroid prime titles. If metroid prime wasn't slapped onto the title than there would be much much less than 9,000 dislikes on it's trailer video. 

I honestly instantly fell in love with triforce heroes because multiplayer, the whole time I was begging for online multiplayer and as soon as I heard the word online I could hear angels singing ""nintendo has won e3"" in my head. It's a whole zelda game to play with friends from online. What more could you ask for in life?"

15399,"Spirit Tracks? In what way? Do you consider Spirit Tracks a spin-off because it most certainly isn't. And if you are comparing it to spirit tracks in terms of quality then that means you are saying that triforce heroes is ridiculously amazing (that's probably really cocky of me to say, but I am a total sucker for the train mechanic and Spirit Tracks in general :P).
