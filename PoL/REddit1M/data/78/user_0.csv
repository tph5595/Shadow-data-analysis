**RELEASE:**  Fall 2015 (3DS)

**To everyone saying ""But I don't have any friends with a 3DS!!"":** Guys, this is what WiFi is for!! I'm sure you will be able to connect to an online lobby and just play with anyone in the world who is also playing the game at the same time!!

**EDIT:** Thanks to /u/zenzangzong2 for catching my spelling mistake with the title of this post (it's ""HEROES"", not ""Heros""). I'm so ashamed lol.

**EDIT: There WILL be a single-player mode!!**"

The WiFi capabilities of the 3DS will make it legit!"

2526,"Well at least care about the fact that you're making a bad name for yourself here that my stick to you regarding your future posts. You're being rude and obnoxious for no reason, and the downvotes are showing that nobody here appreciates it."

5637,"Honestly, playing with random people is one of my FAVORITE parts of video games.

For example, I've had Xbox Live since it originally came out for the original Xbox (so like over 11 years), and I STILL constantly play with some of the randoms I met all the way back then on Halo 2.

I think playing with people from all over the world that you don't know personally, and are just united by your love of the game, is actually more fun than playing with kids you know.

At least give it a shot, friend!"
