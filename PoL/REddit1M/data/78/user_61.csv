But [this right here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGu3Xe1uUUg) is fucking disgraceful and they should honestly issue an apology to the Metroid fanbase.

We're coming up on the 30 year anniversary of Metroid and fans have been begging for a new title forever and this is what they give them? What the fuck were they thinking??

On the 30 year anniversary of Metroid, one of their few serious game series', they decide to use Metroid's name to sell some barely related kiddie bullshit to their apparent target demographic of 6 year olds. I guess they just decided they're going to be the next V-Tech.

Edit: Maybe I'm wrong and they'll release an actual Metroid game sometime next year. God I hope so. But if this is it I'm seriously going to fucking Boycott Nintendo and find a way to pirate the next Zelda."

Instead we get some lame kiddie game(from Nintendo? \*Gasp!*)

Edit: Fingers crossed that they have something actually good planned for Metroid but at this point I sort of doubt it."
12173,I hope so. Because I don't think Metroid fans are exactly excited about his game.
