6276,Fashion based upgrades. *sigh* I really don't want that in my Zelda.
20163,Yet it uses the ALBW engine directly. And upgrades based on fashion choices. I don't think Nintendo got the memo that the US isn't super into that shit like they are in Japan. Seeing Link in those costumes is just weird and gimmicky.
20337,Oh yes because wearing masks is exactly the same as Toon Link in a dress being revealed behind a fashion show runway-like curtain. STRIKE A POSE. No. MM was not like that.
20648,"Let me re-phrase. Link not wearing a tunic, making costume changes behind a curtain... just isn't exciting to me. He looks so awkward and out of place with those costumes. I just don't think it's a practical or interesting way to incorporate basic abilities like a spin attack.

And no, THREE tunic types is not the same as fashion-runway Link."
20816,Big difference between a few tunics with elemental resistances and LOOK LINKS IN A DRESS AND SILLY COSTUMES. Too goofy and dumb for me.
