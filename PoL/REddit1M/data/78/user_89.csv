17130,"I'm a lot more excited for Hyrule Warriors Legends, though I did expect it to be this year instead of next year... bit peeved at that! Hopefully it'll be EARLY next year! Still, what is this? Is this gonna have any single-player to it at all, or is it purely a multiplayer ""party-style"" game?"
