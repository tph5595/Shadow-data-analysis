3528,Agreed. Super disappointed and not really looking forward to anything Nintendo is releasing in the next year. Looks like the Wii U continues to collect dust. 
16143,"Kind of seems like a lame bone to throw for people upset about Zelda U being pushed back. I agree smash and karts are awesome but I get bored really quick playing those games. I refuse to pay for DLC too so I don't really have a reason to boot up smash again. 

Oh well I got lots of witcher 3 left and in november will be fallout. 

I'm really starting to be disappointed with this Wii U. Nothing for this system interests me at all. "
41326,"Haha I had to put it away until my mid terms are done. I would sit down and say I'm only going to play for 45 minutes and three hours would go by. It was causing me to stay up way to late. 

I plan on putting a lot of hours in on my week off. "
41399,Fingers crossed. 
41492,Ahhh not really my thing. Sure it would be good but money is kind of tight and I have a few other games on my backlog list to get to on other systems. 
74490,"I like Nintendo games just fine but I hate that most of them seem so barebones and repetitive. I bought it for Mario kart, smash bros and Zelda U. Also played twilight princess and skyward sword which I missed cause I didn't buy a Wii. 

I've put around 30 hours into Mario kart (most at the cottage with a group of friends) probably 15-20 into smash and 40+ for each Zelda game so far. So overall it has gotten some use but not a ton.

I bought the Wii U because I thought it had potential and I didn't really realize how bad the third party support was. I figured like every other system I would find some gems and stray from the usual AAA titles. I also didn't realize that 95% of the games on this system were JRPG or side scrollers. Nothing wrong with these genres just not what I enjoy. 

In all honesty after beating Zelda I may turn around and sell it if I can get any kind of decent return for it. If not my nephew will be old enough to enjoy Mario in a few years so he can just have it."
