2720,"I understand you're frustrated but I invite you to take a look at this from another perspective.  I feel that a comment saying ""source?"" can simply mean ""where did you hear this?"" rather than ""could you post a link?""   Secondly, I know it's very hard to read tone accurately online, dude, but from my perspective the first shot was thrown at ""no shit sherlock.""  That's sarcasm.  

""uhhh E3?"" just sounds baffled as if Tomes is surprised you wouldn't piece together that e3 was today.  

At the end of the day, perceive it how you want and react how you want.  Now you have another perspective on why the strong consensus is against you.  

Have a better day."
