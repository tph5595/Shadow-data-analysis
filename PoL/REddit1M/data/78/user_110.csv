28303,"This one probably won't be my thing.  Mayyyybe if I have enough friends who get it, but probably not.  I wasn't that big on Four Swords (whichever one of those came with LttP), and I'm not really a fan of the ""toon link"" games (WW, PH, ST, LttP, LbW) in general (notable exception: Minish Cap, which didn't take itself too seriously and was fairly short).

It's ok for the franchise to have different games that are, yanno, actually different from one another.  This fanbase is huge, and while there are some common favorites, not everyone likes the same stuff.

Maybe because I've been playing Zelda games since I was little, I've gotten the expectation that Nintendo will deliver on their own schedule.  That schedule is usually slow.  If they want to throw out a little experimental game for 3DS, which most likely borrows heavily from materials already generated for previous 3DS games, fine, whatever.  I'll keep looking forward to Zelda ~~2015~~ 2016.

(I would bet, based on comments regarding other Nintendo projects, that WiiU Zelda was getting pushed out regardless of this game.)

Just my 2 cents."
