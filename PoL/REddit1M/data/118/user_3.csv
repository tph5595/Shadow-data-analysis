633,"It works basically like every other weapon: after it takes a certain amount of damage, it breaks. But instead of being permanently lost, it will ""recharge"" and be usable again after a fixed amount of time (I think 10 minutes).

It also gets a power boost (30 to 60) when near Guardians or inside Divine Beasts, and I think it's unbreakable while it's boosted."
1186,"No, it has its own dedicated inventory slot that doesn't count towards your limit and can't be used by anything else."
1497,"It's extremely viable, that's basically the point of the game! If you just stick to the main quest and don't explore on your own, you'll actually be a little underpowered. Exploration will help you build your heart/stamina meters and find better equipment. You might stumble across tough enemies in some spots, but you can just avoid them for now.

That said, I *would* recommend heading east and doing the first couple of main quests early on, as you get some additional tools/knowledge that will make exploring a little more productive. But it's absolutely not required, and you can definitely just head out into the world on your own if you want."
2178,"I'm going through the same thing right now. As the other poster mentioned, Zora's Domain sells them, but only four at a time. 

Some other good sources I've found are the waterfall behind the Dueling Peaks Shrine, and the northern slope of Death Mountain (warp to Gut Check Rock and head west). "
2434,"For tracking down the last few shrines, I found [this map](https://imgur.com/m0zacxO) to be helpful without just giving away the locations. Usually shrine quests will be given by people in the same region as the shrine, though in some cases they might start in an adjacent region. (A shrine in the Hebra mountains might have the quest given in Rito Village, for example.)"
4532,"I don't think you need to have defeated the divine beast (I definitely did Lynel Safari at the same time as the quest to get the shock arrows) but you may need to at least start the main quest chain in that area. If you haven't talked to the King and Sidon and agreed to help them, the other Zoras may not offer their quests. "
5505,"Most of the time, the reward for killing those mini-bosses is the loot that they drop. You'll eventually need a bunch of their monster parts (horns, guts, toenails, etc) in order to upgrade your armor. The equipment that they drop is usually pretty good as well -- Lynel weapons, shields, and bows are among the best in the game. 

Early on, fighting those guys can be a little counterproductive, since (as you discovered) you'll burn through a lot of weapons and you won't have a use for the monster parts right away. Unless you're looking for a challenge, it may be smart to just avoid them until you're a little stronger."
7188,"It would have been a nice easter egg, but he's probably been dead for at least 10,000 years. (Though, do Koroks age and die? Maybe not?) And depending on which timeline we're in, he may never have existed at all.

Map references aside, Nintendo seems to have specifically avoided anything that would specifically tie the game to a particular timeline or era. There are a few references to Ocarina of Time, but other than that it almost feels like this is supposed to be a reboot: it's so far in the future that all of the previous events are just legends. Sticking in a cameo from Wind Waker would have gone against all of that. "
10607,"I think I've found the one you're missing: the [Toto Sah shrine](http://www.polygon.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-guide-walkthrough/2017/3/21/15013392/toto-sah-shrine-location-puzzle-solutions), on the river just south of Dueling Peaks stable. "
10773,"Switch or Wii U? I haven't used the Switch eShop, but on the Wii U there's a place in the eShop menu where you can redeem codes. I would expect the Switch version to work the same way."
10888,"I don't know why you were downvoted, because you're right. One of the pieces is on Mt. Lanayru, the other is on an island in the Necluda Sea."
15870,"Honestly, for Vah Naboris I would put the guide away and just figure out it on your own.  It's fairly short and not that difficult, but it's very easy to get lost or disoriented if you don't have your head wrapped around how the pieces fit together and what's happening when you're moving them. 

Trying to follow a set of directions is probably going to be more frustrating than just jumping in, looking at where you need to go, and moving the pieces around to get you there."
15982,"Yeah, the horse fairy is a separate thing. There are four armor fairies, plus the horse fairy. "
16025,"When you equip all three items, it will appear on the inventory screen where it normally shows armor effects (next to Link)."
18301,"As far as I know, there's no limit. I have one Twilight Bow hanging on the wall of my house and one in my inventory, and I've had other amiibo-specific items drop (like the Hero's Shield and the tunic pieces) while I had copies on my person already. "
20871,"Hard to say. Is that all you've done in the game? In terms of landscape, there is a lot more variety out there -- different regions have mountains, snow, desert, lakes/rivers, etc. The Necluda/Faron is a lot of grassland and forest, so I could see that getting monotonous. 

If you're referring to the activities and enemies you're fighting, though, then that's not going to change much. You're pretty much always going to be scouring the environment for shrines and fighting Moblins and Lizalfos. This is a pretty open game that's all about exploration, so if you prefer to have more direction and a tighter experience, it might just not be the game for you.

Before giving up on it, though -- have you done any of the divine beasts yet? If all you've done is explore the lower-right of the map, I'd recommend heading North of Kakariko/Hateno and trying to find the Zora. That will lead into a major quest which is a little more varied and directed than just ""run around looking for stuff"". You may still be bored, but you'll have at least seen what the game's all about by that point and can decide for yourself whether you want to continue."
