41459,"Legit question:

Does anyone know how NIntendo is going to implement Hard Mode in the upcoming DLC this summer? I ask because I've already beaten the game (near 100% - korok seeds), and I want to know how they would implement a hard mode. Do you think they're going to make you start a new game? How would that work since there is only one save file per account? Also, if you want to make a new game with a new account, the DLC won't transfer over? Does the hard mode basically force people who have finished the game to delete their save?"
