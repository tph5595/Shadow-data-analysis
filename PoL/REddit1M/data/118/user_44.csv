I haven't played that titan yet, 300 hours in.. :P Just continue, and if your really stuck then describe where you are exactly ;) Also, i've ordered the piggyback official guide, will come in tomorrow. Will have it for completion later, not for finishing the game. I can let you know how the quality is."
22193,"Really? I haven't read anything about it. Can you show me off what, for example?
I can still cancel it till it gets shipped to me tomorrow. I thought it was a good guide."
23285,"May i ask what version you have? I'm not quite sure, but i guess there are some things missing in the first version of the guide, but blurry font isn't exactly what i am expecting. To be fair, all reviews say the hard cover version is excelent printed?"
23691,"Alright, appriciate the warning. If i am not happy with it, i just send it back. I've ordered the hard cover only today. Its getting shipped tomorrow."
