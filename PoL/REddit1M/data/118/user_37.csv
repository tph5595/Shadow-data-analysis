46044,Hearty Bass a little scarce.  I farmed mine by the waterfalls south of Tarrey Town.  Stealthfin Trout south and southwest of Great Hyrule Forest near Mekar Island.  There are some Silent Princess near Kakariko Fairy and also the Master Sword pedestal.  Voltfruit is plentiful on cactus all around Gerudo Town and Bazaar.
