4714,Why isn't Makar on Makar Island? Seems like a missed opportunity to me.
5581,"Yes but the difference is there is already a game mechanic (900 korok seeds over the map) which would have made it easy to add him. I'm surprised there isn't a korok leaf on that island at all. If there was, it would have been cool if it was Makar."
7136,Good point.
