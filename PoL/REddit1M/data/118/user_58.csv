33673,"Anyone know good spots to find any of the following?

* Hearty Bass
* Stealthfin Trout
* Silent Princess
* Voltfruit"
33801,It *will* break (lose power) while fighting Guardians. Guardians just deplete its durability much less than anything else.
33938,"There aren't really **13** shrines in the Hebra region, are there? I hate that place."
34582,"Warning: Very minor spoilers just in terms of how things fit together.

&gt; could I gain anything by breaking off and exploring on a bigger scale?

Yes.

&gt; Or would enemies just be too difficult

Also yes.

It's a bit of a balancing act. Keep a few things in mind:

First, enemies will gradually become stronger (more HP and stronger weapons) as you kill more of them. The flip side of this, though, is that you will therefore find better weapons as you kill more enemies.

Generally, it is an excellent idea to spend at least *some* time finding things which will make you stronger: mainly shrines (more health/stamina) and Korok seeds (let you carry more weapons, bows, and shields). Later, when you find your first Great Fairy Fountain, it is an *excellent* idea to gather the components required to upgrade your armor ASAP.

I second u/GrafKarpador's recommendation to make a fairly direct path through the main quest as far as Hateno Village, or at least Kakariko Village. That said, as long as you're not going out of your way to kill every single enemy around all day 'erry day, it's unlikely that exploration is going to cause the game to become more difficult than you can handle.

Plus...it's so pretty~~!"
34941,"Nope, there are just big bad creatures sprinkled throughout the overworld. They each have a certain territory (or in the giants' case, a certain spot where they like to nap).

The centaurs are called Lynels, and are definitely the strongest of these mini-bosses in the entire game. The giant cyclopses are called Hinoxes, and they're actually quite easy to deal with as long as you stay out of their way. (They're slow and dumb.)

They drop good weapons and good loot, and you'll need a bunch of that loot to upgrade some of your armor.

One warning: as far as I know, Hinoxes will always stay the same; that is, if you find a red Hinox in a certain place, it will always be red when it respawns. It won't scale up. I haven't been able to confirm this myself, but according to the guide, *apparently* most Lynels scale up as you defeat more of them, with a few exceptions."
35091,"You have to stun him by hitting him square in the face with an arrow, at which point he will fall to his knees. Then run up to his flank and you can press A to mount him like a horse. You can get in a bunch of free shots that way, it's great. Best part is, you don't even get thrown off, you jump off automatically and land on your feet."
35670,"Other regions vary widely: some are mainly grassland and forest--the ones you've found--some are mountainous. There's a desert, a volcano, a couple of tundra areas, a wetland or two.

You can beetle your way through the main quest lines and have a fairly typical Zelda experience if you like, but this game emphasizes exploration and rewards you for it, mainly by letting you upgrade yourself and your stuff. If you don't find those rewards rewarding, that's fair, though."
35744,"I think you were lucky. ""Modest Test"" Guardians can drop cores, but don't always.

Hell, I fought through 6 or 8 Stalkers in Hyrule Field in one go and only got a single stinkin' core."
36079,"To expand on inventory expansion: on the way to Kakariko Village you'll meet an enormous Korok named Hestu. He will upgrade your inventory capacity in exchange for increasing numbers of Korok seeds. So keep your eyes peeled for Korok hiding spots!

He will do four or five upgrades right there on the road, then move on. You can later find him near Riverside Stable in the Central region, close to the border with Dueling Peaks region. He'll do another six upgrades for you here. After that you have to find your way through the Lost Woods into the Korok forest, where he remains for the rest of the game."
36240,Haven't seen a single one. I guess I need to wander more.
43565,"No, that's Blue Nightshade. Or is there Silent Princess there too?"
43579,Thanks!
44494,"There might be. I'll check. But it's definitely Blue Nightshade that grows plentifully there.

I *did* find a couple at the fairy fountain deep in the Gerudo desert. But I think that was just a one-off; it's nothing like the number of Blue Nightshade/Armoranth/Mighty Thistle that you find at the other three fountains."
54506,Nothing but mountains and snow. Takes ages to get anywhere. Plus you're forced to either use the Snowquill armor set or stock up on elixirs.
54573,Thanks!
54600,Huh. Apparently I haven't been checking carefully enough around the fairy fountains.
98159,"Good to know, thanks."
98360,"Thanks! 

I guess I just haven't wandered around the desert enough to find any Voltfruit. The only time I was there, I was making a pretty direct beeline for the Fairy Fountain, so I wasn't really looking."
98423,"I do, actually. But that still doesn't help you move about on the ground."
