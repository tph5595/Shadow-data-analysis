53102,WHY HAVE I NOT THOUGHT OF THIS. IT WAS SO OBVIOUS
53333,Nintendo trolled us by leaving a lone rock at the base of a lone tree on a lone island. I wonder what everyone's faces looked like when they picked that rock up and there was no korok 
53451,There's 3 silent princesses near every great fairy. 
53572,"* Heart Bass - Zora's Domain and Floria Falls

* Stealthfin Trout - the river around the Great Hyrule Forest. Hunt at night so they glow 

* Silent Princess - near each Great Fairy and Satori Mountain 

* Voltfruit - Gerudo Desert (growing on cacti)"
53761,Yeah they come out during storms 
53907,"Yes, I've been playing after beating the game. I'm just exploring and trying to get as many Korok seeds without guides (I have a little over 400 now)  Once I feel like giving up, I'll use a guide. Most people will probably stop after beating all the quests/shrines though. "
54160,Horses come in two temperaments: gentle (spotted colors) and wild (solid colors). Gentle horses are easier to tame and you'll be able to grab one easily with one stamina wheel. Wild horses tend to have higher stats but will typically require more stamina to break. You can also use stamina-restoring food if you can't upgrade stamina yet.

54367,"Previous Zelda hard modes have been a new game. But they've also had multiple save files so I'm not sure. As for DLC, I know for the Switch the DLC is available for all accounts when you purschse it once. "
54426,"Locations. Some locations on the map are only unlocked when you visit it, so you have to explore more. "
71243,Visit the area at night. But be prepared ;)
71282,Are you using the Ceremonial Trident?
