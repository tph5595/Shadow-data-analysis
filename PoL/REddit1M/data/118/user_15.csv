4825,I just killed some badass centaur that was shooting ice arrows at me (I only have like 6 hearts so I backflipped a bunch and used up like all my weapons in the process ) then I found some giant and killed him at this lake called purifier lake. Was there something else supposed to be here? Seems like a pretty tough boss to be gaurding basically nothing!
