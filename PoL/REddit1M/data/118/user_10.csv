3255,"So I'm trying to get into this Shrine in Zora's Domain by doing The Ceremonial Song sidequest, but when I talk to Laruta the quest doesn't activate. Do I need to have defeated Vah Ruta before the quest will begin? Also, the Lynel Safari side quest won't activate either. Do I need to wait until after Vah Ruta for that one too?"
4931,"For both of them? Is it possible to activate the shrine without activiating the side quest? I've done that before. But for the Lynel Safari, you have to wait?"
11403,"Hmmm I talked to the girl who gives you the quest and I even took a picture of the Lynel in question, but she's still grumbling. Do I have to do anything to trigger it?"
