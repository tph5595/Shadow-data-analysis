14077,"I'm on my last beast  (the camel one) and my guide is so poorly written I'm setting that task aside for a few days. 

Anyone know of any guides that are actually worth the money? 

Also the yiga hideout is so fun. "
21822,"The Piggyback guide is the worst, dude. Return it if you can. 

Tons of missing and inaccurate info. "
23120,"It's missing a few shrines, a few ""go left, no other left"" gaffes. The print quality is very poor. TINY, blurry font. 

The walk through is very vague and often inaccurate. I got super turned around in a Beast yesterday because that guide kept telling me to kill Malice goo that doesn't exist. 

Stuff like that. You're better off here, with YouTube or zelda Dungeon. "
23629,I have the paperback from Amazon. Ordered it a few days after launch. I'm out and about right now but I'll let you know which version when I'm home!
