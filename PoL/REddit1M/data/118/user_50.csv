25231,"Where are the best places to farm cores? I've seen online guides that said to attack mobile guardians, but I've had crap luck getting them to drop cores. I've only found 10 total between shrines and drops, and spent about half of them on updating stasis. 
Edit: I mean the small cores, not the large one. Weirdly, I've had better luck getting giant cores to drop from guardians than small ones."
