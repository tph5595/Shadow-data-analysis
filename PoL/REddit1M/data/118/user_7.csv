You can wander around and mostly find weaker enemies for a while if that's what you're in to, or you can rush around to the Divine Beasts and plow through the story first. It's entirely up to you, which is one of the glories of the game.

If you are extra sneaky, sneaking into Hyrule Castle can get you a lot of nice weapons much earlier than you would typically get them, and there are plenty of things to discover just by wandering around."

You might not be able to get it until you are officially sent to get the Shock Arrows by King Zora and Sidon. That might be the trigger to activate the quest."

I would suggest holding on to Diamonds though, they are the only way to get certain weapons and are fairly rare, plus there are tons of ways to make money in this game besides just selling stuff."
99803,"true, but if you're going by monetary value, the 10 Luminous Stones that you have to give to get 1 Diamond are worth more than the Diamond. You'd be better off selling the 10 Luminous Stones, unless you're just getting the Diamond for a specific reason."
100689,That's fair. To me I just stockpile all the Diamonds I can and just head to the Hebra Tower to bowl my way to riches when I need to.
