I've tried nearly everything-none of your runes work on the bones-you can't blow them up or freeze them, lift them with a magnet. U also can't use fire arrows or any other type. I've tried using a sword and other sword like weapons on them. The only thing I can thing of is to try a hammer-like weapon."
