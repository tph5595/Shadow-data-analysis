Also, how exactly does the Taming a horse mechanic work? I killed an enemy on a horse once and just stole it without a problem. But now that I've found a few stables I really want to register a wild horse.

Anyway, once I get on a wild horse it just starts bucking and it says press L which I do a few times until my stamina is out and I'm thrown off. Is it a timing thing with when I hit L or do I just need a lot more stamina? I am pretty early in the game and only have 5 hearts. Thanks!"
