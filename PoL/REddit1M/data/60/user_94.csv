39961,Bullshit. That was Ura. MM started as a project of a few employee in there spare time. The deadline at first was get it done in a year or it gets canceled. After the people saw what  they were working on was great they gave them more time. Having the game basically finished it was mainly used for polishing.
40026,Ehhh? I don't like TP to much. But SS is easily the best in the series from an objective point of view.
44646,It was. The bug collecting killed it for me. The dungeons where great but fuck those god damn bugs.
58616,"Subject as in pure gameplay and mechanics. I personally  found it , even with wii controls which I would trade for a controller at any time, to play smoother and more intuitive then a lot of the previous games. From being able to store bombs in your bag to rolling them it felt like natural ways to use the items instead of the one trick items a lot of the past Zeldas had. 

TWW and OoT are major offenders for that . I love both , TWW being my favorite Zelda game. But some items have one very lame use and then just sit in your inventory forever. 

How much did you use the magic ? How often did you pull out the Hammer unless the game made you? How much other stuff then a fairy did you really have in your bottle most of the time?

It is not that those games are bad but mechanically and from the story flow ( not the story but rather how you progress through it) is worse then in SS. Or at least it felt for me that way. They are wait better games to just get lost in. Which SS sometimes lacked. But there is no denying that OoT's story is sketchy at points. And tww  litrally makes you grind at one point. "
64306,No just unlike most I don't have only a massive boner for OoT and see it as the good game.... Jesus it is like most of you never played any other Zelda game.
