One of the reasons TP was delayed was to revamp the visual style of the Twilight Realm from black/white to creepy over-saturated colors."

Why can't they ever keep a time table? There's no ~~fucking~~ point in announcing a release date if they can't be honest with themselves about development time.

Nintendo's third party support is bad enough that they need big first party titles at their console's launch, not three or four years afterward.

Also, I don't think longer development time necessarily translates to a better game. Based on the gameplay footage, I don't think there's much to do aside from polishing, unless they scrapped some of the content, or decided to change the gameplay completely.

Since the Wii U is three years old, and there's been such minimal information about Zelda U, I've become pretty anxious about it. It's the only reason I bought the console."
