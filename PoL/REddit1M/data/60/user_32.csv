These trailers have little to nothing to do with the production of the game and after revealing it last year, and even bothering to show gameplay at VGA, there's no sense in it being completely absent.

But hey, it wouldn't make any sense not to show any part of the game when they were able to at VGA. It's very likely this'll be the last E3 before the game's release unless it gets pushed to summer 2016 which I doubt will happen so leaving it out would be a glaring omission. "
