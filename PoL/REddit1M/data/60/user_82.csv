Also, there's no reason to take this so personally and get angry. I was simply asking why is there so much hate. Twilight Princess is my favorite Zelda game after LttP, so I'm going to defend it to the grave. It had my favorite art style, mechanics, and setting. Also Midna was the best companion Link has ever had, that's not even debatable. "
