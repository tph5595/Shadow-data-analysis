903,"&gt; This feels similar to Twilight Princess, in that there's a possibility we could see dual release across the Wii U and the ""NX"".

No. There is not.

That would be such a big slap in the face to all the damned fools (like me) who bought a Wii U for Zelda U. I wouldn't expect Nintendo to the same shitty thing again...and to a console they're struggling to sell.

Seriously, fuck Nintendo if they do that. "
2194,You're right my bad...so it would make it even worse if Nintendo does it with Zelda U. 
66050,"Highest selling doesn't mean best. It's a mediocre game with horrible pacing and a lackluster art style. In terms of sales, not only was it released on the Wii, the best-selling console at the time, but it released on two consoles. 

Even then, it sold less copies than OOT on the Wii, (OOT 7.6 mill, TP 7.2 mill) only when you add the copies it sold on the GameCube (1.32 mill) does it become the ""best"" selling Zelda game but those numbers aren't something to get excited about. "
