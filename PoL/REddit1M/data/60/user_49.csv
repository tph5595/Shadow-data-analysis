8000,"To be honest though, the last two console installments were... Ehh??? And they were delayed how many times?? I wonder when they delay games if they are simply dilly dallying around. I know it's good to release a game when it is ready, but when they assure us over and over that it is a 2015 title this is kind of ridiculous."

Twilight Princess was given an extra year in development and I have personal doubts how beneficial it actually was to the overall final game. Normally I'd be fine with delays, but from Nintendo this is kind of ridiculous after they were assuring us 100% that the title will release in 2015. I'm not so optimistic for this title anymore. Sorry guys, bring the downvotes."
