7904,"Preparing a hands-on version for E3 is a major undertaking and takes a lot of time on the developer side - presenting something playable at E3 would push the release date even farther back. Hands-off versions or videos are not that problematic, maybe they resort to that - if not, key features may not be in a presentable state and would distort the impression they want to convey.

Don't get me wrong, I was also preparing to be blown away by Zelda footage at E3 - but E3 isn't the only video game fair, they have Nintendo Directs and sometimes even little fairs of their own. Maybe they pull something off as soon as they're confident in showing it. In my opinion, hardcore fans should be the ones who understand the reasons behind delays, and they should have the stamina to wait for more info because they already experienced what ""happened"" to delayed Zelda games - they became brilliant games. The development of that game costs a fortune, they also want to please their investors, and I'm sure that it was no easy decision.  
What's very different from other developers is that they don't release the smallest snippet, no screenshot and no gameplay info, over time. Maybe you can do that when you own the brand ""Zelda"" - mentioning it creates enough attention in itself. If Zelda were the only thing to show at this year's E3, maybe they had decided differently? We just have to wait a bit..."
