4437,"Honestly I never thought they were going to release in 2015 anyway, but I wouldn't be terribly surprised if it gets pushed all the way back to late 2016 as then they will have a chance to hype it up at next year's E3 (and would explain in part why they wouldn't show anything this year imo).  In fact, I think if nothing is shown at E3 this year, we can take that as confirmation that they are waiting until next E3 to reveal the big details which means at best the game is second half of 2016."
