The delay and the potential for an E3-no show is kind of foreboding to be honest. If they are indeed doing something new they should at least be able to give us a glimpse to whet our appetites. Makes me wonder if they had to go back to square one on some things."

I'll always be a fan though. Just have to wait and see how this all shakes out."
17296,"I certainly understand the effort involved in prepping a hands on, or any type of presentation. But what concerns me is that the official statements from [Nintendo](https://twitter.com/NintendoUK/status/581580144747372544) and [Aounuma](http://nintendoeverything.com/zelda-wii-u-wont-be-shown-at-e3/) so far appear to indicate that Zelda will not be shown in any way; no hands on, no trailer, hell we might not even get a name.

If they really do forgo any and all Zelda info at E3, then I think that is a bad sign. They have already been capable of showing two videos in the past year. Exactly how much are they changing that would prevent them from providing even a glimpse? To say nothing of what a slap in the face it is to hardcore fans who thrive on the potential for Zelda info at E3, it portends some kind of snag or massive realignment in this title. And it remains to be seen (until after E3 at least) whether that is ultimately a good or bad thing. "

Though it is awful hard to think they would make the effort to say, in no uncertain terms through various channels, that there will be no Zelda at E3 and not really mean it."
