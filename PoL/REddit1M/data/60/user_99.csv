45148,"I bet you that Zelda Wii U won't be Zelda Wii U, this game isn't going to safe the Wii U, if it is, it'll probably upset a lot of people if there's a new console after they just bought one to play Zelda Wii U, I think this game is going to be the release game for Nintendo's new console. Just theorizing, but I would make a lot of sense if you look at Twilight Princess"
