49927,"Unless you got to play an actual copy of a less developed version of the game, which is impossible because it doesn't exist, then you have no grounds to say that this is a bad thing. Twilight Princess with a year less time in development is just the game with that much less content. Just because you didn't like the final result doesn't mean something evil happened in that extra year."
56563,I commented because of how illogical what you said sounded. You implied that because this game got delayed that it somehow is going to turn out like twilight princess. Whether or not you meant it that way that's still how your comment reads.
58665,"Just because it's a recent example doesn't imply that the delay has anything but a positive affect on the outcome. These games are often delayed, not just twilight princess. And despite all that, it remains many people's favorite game in the franchise. It's just one instance of a game not being to your taste, but this is a different game with a different intended direction and the delay has nothing to do with it. My point was that you probably would have liked it even less without that extra year of development."
