254570,You're absolutely right! I've been saying this for years. Why can't we have two full Zelda games per console anymore? Just use the same engine to make a sequel. Maybe explore more of the same world. Just stop making a Zelda game every five years. That's way too long for the quality we seem to be getting the past few games. If they were OOT quality that'd be one thing. What Skyward Sword had in story it absolutely lacked in overworld and good sidequests. That game was a total letdown to me.
