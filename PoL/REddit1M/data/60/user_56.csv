9900,I agree...this reminds me too much of TP and I absolutely did not enjoy the game as much as I had hoped to.
55750,"OOT has it beat at 7.6 million copies according to wikipedia. And just because its one of the best selling zeldas doesn't mean I have to like it. I just don't think it was that great of a game, especially with how long it took to finish. I didn't care that much about the dark styling of it, several of the items weren't useful after their dungeon, the story didn't capture me like other zeldas.

I just don't care for it. I had been planning for a while to replay it and give it a second chance, but I don't expect much."

Does it matter how long they had to develop something? If I don't like it then I don't like it, regardless of effort or features put into it.

I just feel like you get angry at someone with a different opinion than you and you just had to attack we with some weirdo comment."
57843,I was giving an example of how recently they had delayed the game and it ended up being rather bland in my opinion. I didn't insist that the reason I didn't like it was because it was delayed to add features. I'm just worried about them delaying games and them not coming out as good as they promised.
