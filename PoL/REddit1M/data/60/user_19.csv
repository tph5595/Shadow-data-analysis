1958,And four sword adventures.

In a couple of years you won't be able to say a bad thing about it without getting shot down for treason against Hyrule.  

Right now we are somewhere between MM and WW being the ultimate games (I don't mind the WW love personally, since it went through the hate part of the cycle too and it is my favorite)  
Somewhere after Zelda U the cycle will move onwards to TP being considered the best zelda game.  
On and on until eternity, for it is the cycle that keeps us spinning."
39210,"The idea was that you could travel between them (like the light/dark world off alttp) so having to switch between discs wouldn't have worked very well.  
That said, they didn't cut the sunken hyrule part of the game just for time like some people seem to think.

So they did say it indirectly."
39276,Unless they pull a game like Four Swords adventures for the WiiU (which I would like tbh)
73609,"Zelda-Cycle is irrelevant on a individual level unless you are someone who believes what people tell him (which happens a lot, hivemind mentality and circlejerking)  
But the zelda cycle is currently at that point and shifting."
74754,"K, thank you for making sure I was notified."
97213,Still the same I see.

Probably around the time a lot of people wished there was more story-focus in zelda games again."
