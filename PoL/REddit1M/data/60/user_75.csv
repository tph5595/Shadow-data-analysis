18362,I mean it was made out if assets from ocarina of time. Half the game was already done. 
176163,You do realize they used the same engine right? Which is the part that tales the longest of time while making a new game. The whole low level understanding the hardware and it's capabilities?  The part which determines what can and can't be done in the hardware. I mean yeah they added new stuff but they were halfway done by the time majoras mask went into production. There's a reason it took them 18 months to make. 
179142,Thankfully they will never do such a thing. 
356035,"I'm all for a new game with the Hero of time, but using the  same engine from those two games would be kinda pointless. And the titles you proposed sound taken out of a fanfiction or written by tetsuya nomura, which isn't bad really. It's just not the kind of title Nintendo would give their games. "
