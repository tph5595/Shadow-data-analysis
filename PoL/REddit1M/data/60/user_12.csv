1182,And they aren't even showing it at E3. https://twitter.com/nintendoamerica/status/581579256704081920
2423,"Yeah, they actually came out and said they were going to show it at E3 2013 and Comic-con 2013, but decided against it. I'm not sure why they're being so secretive. A trailer would be awesome to maintain the hype, I don't even know if we'll see any more of it between now and like Summer 2016, which is really bad."

13425,How? They aren't showing it at E3 2015.
