138633,"Sorry, but not everyone sees it that way. When someone says, ""we will release in 2015"" or ""we expect to release in 2015"", I genuinely believe that's what they mean and it's not some secret underhanded marketing tactic. It wasn't obvious to me at all and I did not expect a delay. 

Edit: To those down voting me, I'm not saying that I'm super upset or angry about the delay. If Nintendo wants to make it their priority to push the release date off to make it better, then so be it. I'd rather it be a good game than be something they rushed. I'm just saying that some people like myself honestly didn't anticipate it being delayed as we just didn't see it that way. Either way, it's not a big deal. We'll get it eventually and I'm sure it'll be awesome."
