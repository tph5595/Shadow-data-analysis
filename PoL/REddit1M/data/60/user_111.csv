56511,Or MAYBEEEE we can form our own opinions and we like those games because they focus on exploration and have ample side quests?

174401,"I like how reusing character models amounts to ""half the game"" for some people. How bout like every single new environment, music track, new items... and more importantly the event scripting, enemy AI, etc. People always act like they just slapped a new paint job on OoT and it's clearly much more than that. "
174568,"I always advocate that the next 3DS Zelda should complete the Ocarina/Hero of Time trilogy. Like how amazing would it be to have a third Zelda game in everyone's favorite engine with new environments, it would be just as golden as ALBW was to ALttP. "
178143,"I'm fully aware of that, I just think ""half the game"" is a bit of a  hyperbole that neglects the artistic aspects that went into it. In fact, I'm still hoping on a third game to use this engine. It would be great, they could call it Link: Beyond Thunderdome, or Zelda and The Last Crusade. "
354131,Haha what? Why not? If they left ALttP untouched for whatever close-minded reasons we'd never have the amazing game that is ALBW.
