It'd be pretty insane for the game to never make to an e3 floor and see the light of day. It's likely going to get a late 2016 release so it can be shown with gameplay at next e3. I don't like it but realistically that's how it's gonna go down."
21367,2013 I recall them not wanting to show it off because they didn't want to risk fatigue for the franchise. They had both ALBW and the Windwaker remake coming that year.

Plus Nintendo will have things to show off this year we haven't heard of, they always do. Will that fill the Zelda shaped void? Probably not. That said, they probably knew of this decision more than a month ago and will be spending a lot of time ensuring that e3 is still a success for them with or without Zelda present. It may be the reason for the lack of a recent direct. They've been known to announce games pre e3 in their directs, perhaps now they want to hold on to those announcements for e3 instead."
