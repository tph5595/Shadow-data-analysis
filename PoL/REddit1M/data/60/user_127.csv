151210,"I do have to ask, what was the hype behind Twilight Princess reveal at E3 2004 about? I am in no way questioning the hype, as any Zelda reveal is total hype, but why is the Twilight Princess reveal considered to be one of the most hype moment of all time? Sorry about the question, I was only 5 during E3 2004, so I'm not necessarily old enough to experience the hype."

152379,"I do find it a bit strange that many people expect the NX to be a home console. The 3DS has been out before the Wii U, generally making it due for a replacement before the Wii U. The New 3DS was made for hardware revisions on the original 3DS, and will likely last about 2 years like the DSi. I hate to say it, but the 3DS is starting to scrape the bottom of the barrel for new releases, and game releases are beginning to thin, other than the big hitters for the handheld. Since the 3DS came out in 2011, it's been out for already 4 years, with the New 3DS coming out early 2015, and an announcement regarding the NX at E3 2016 mostly would mean a 2017 release date. (I'm talking about this like it's the near future whereas I'm going to be graduating by then!) A 2017 release would mean a 6 year life for the 3DS line, which is generally about how long each generation lasts. I mean, by that time, the Wii U will also be 5 years old, and Nintendo could blow us away with the announcement of a new home console and handheld."
152973,"Honestly, as a Zelda fan, I can't help but be disappointed, especially after their repeated confidence of a 2015 release making it seem set in stone. And of course not showing it at E3 feels like so much of a big slap in the face. Like, E3 is meant to update us with how development is going, which would be great so we could know *what* the delay exactly was for. I mean, I'm hoping for *at least* a title. This far in development, a title should generally be decided upon by now, and it would give us fans at least *something* to speculate about while it's delayed.

That being said, I know that they are using the time to create an amazing game, rather than rush out a dull and boring game with nothing in it. I'm not sure how significant these changes they:re making are, but I'm glad to know that they are committed to make this an amazing game, rather than rush it for a quick buck. I mean, GTA V got delayed, and look how amazing it turned out. I imagine a similar situation with Zelda Wii U."
185086,"Skyward Sword did excel storywise, imo. That prediction is definitely plausible, considering Zelda Wii U is open-world, and most of the time, in an open-world game, story tends to take a back seat. Then again, this is a Zelda game, so I can't put it past the developers to make an amazing story with a non-linear open-world."
185281,"Plausible, yes. But it has been done before with the PS Vita. So what can Nintendo do to make it unique and different? I have no doubt that they can, but I really am curious. What if they create a new type of gaming system that is neither a handheld nor a home console? Like, something never done before."
186007,"I mean, of course it was half-hearted. I can wholeheartedly say Nintendo always has had control of the console market, and I don't see that changing any time soon. "
