34949,"&gt;nvm, in Hyrule Historia they say he's the Link from OoT and MM

Which means absolutely nothing. Hero's Spirit isn't HoT Link; nowhere in the game is it even suggested, much less proven. Someone just made that up and called it canon."
37033,"Nah, there needs to be some in-game evidence for that."
37388,Could you enlighten me to the evidence you're talking about? Because I'm 99% sure there isn't any empirical evidence that the Hero's Shade is HoT Link.
37790,"Oh? Then is this canon?

38171,"It's straight out of the Hyrule Historia, and its wrong. He said the Hyrule Historia is canon, and I showed where what is presented in the book conflicts with what the game says. Surely we can all acknowledge that the medallions are on the wrong two sages, yes?

"
38484,"&gt;You seem very narrow-minded, so Im not gonna waste my time. Im just gonna say that no matter what you say, it is cannon and there is a lot of evidence and it is already convinced.

There isn't any evidence in-game, and if there is, someone please present it.

&gt;For the way you are wording these comments, it seems that you don't like that the HoT is the Hero's Shade. Am I right?

You would be right. My main issue is that I don't like Dark Horse comics just coming up with alleged 'facts' and people just swallowing it without a single shred of evidence."
38591,"Actually, Dark Horse Comics made it, and Aonuma even put a disclaimer in the back of the book saying that they have creative freedom and can basically change anything any time they want.

No need for name-calling."
38641,Timeline is wrong too. Downfall timeline? Hah.
38873,"&gt;It's evidence. 

It's circumstantial evidence, which just indicates plausibility.

&gt;it's considered canon.

Doesn't make it so. There are plenty who know better.

&gt;Hero Shade being the Hero of Time is just as canon as the official timeline, which was also made up. 

And the timeline is wrong as well.

&gt;Zelda is a work of fiction and part of that means that the creators can say whatever they want about it and it's then canon.

You didn't read Aonuma's disclaimer in the back of the book, did you? Go crack open your copy and see."
39960,"&gt;Fact is, HH is the closest we can get to true or false, which is why it's quoted all the time and why people point to it in cases like this.

I'm of the belief that the game itself is the closest thing to the truth. Fan theories are fun to talk about, but I don't believe people should take them as fact just because it might be plausible. People get all worked up about something that simply has no basis in the facts. Also, thank you for reasonably discussing it with me instead of getting upset, lol.

103646,"&gt;A simple page layout error doesn't invalidate deliberately constructed points in the book.

True, but combine that with the fact that the claims are unsubstantiated and don't bear a single shred of evidence means that there was no battle in the first place. The claim that Hero's Shade is HoT is simply fanon.

Let me see if I can find that list of Hyrule Historia errors...

Edit: I found it, but it's 6500 words long, and the guy who wrote it asked that it not be put up in a thread, so a pm instead?"
