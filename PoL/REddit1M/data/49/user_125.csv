49970,"They tried to cater too much to the Japanese audience since Metroid Prime wasn't a very big hit in Japan.

By doing so, they sort of turned their backs on the true Metroid fans in the west.

Other M was a solid GAME. In terms of a good Metroid game? Easily the worst.

I'm really happy that they're releasing Super Metroid on the New3DS but extremely disappointed with the direction the new handheld games are going. They're making too many arcade-like games that don't really hold my interest (i.e. Triforce heroes, Federation Force). I want a novel not a short story!

I think Metroid is best as a side-scroller for handhelds and I think that with the 3DS' capabilities, they would be able to pull off a beautiful Metroid. Konami failed in Castlevania, I want to see what Nintendo can do with Metroid."
