Yes, the Wii U isn't getting a new A+++++ game every week like some of the other consoles but that doesn't mean that Nintendo has abandoned it or that there aren't any good games for it.  I have faith that Zelda Wii U will still be released on the Wii U (and possibly alongside the NX just like TP was originally released for GC and Wii)"
