It makes no sense to release a major exclusive title like that this late in a dead consoles generation. Let's face it, the WiiU was shit and is shit. I would rather them wait and release it only on the NX. And I think everyone here can agree that the WiiU is the worst home console of this generation. It's got what? Five, maybe six good games. Not to mention only having a few unique ones. The Nintendo community needs to start calling the big N on this shit before they go under. They won't survive another console generation like the one they just had. 

I personally wish they would just go third party. Nintendo makes great software, not great hardware."

Nintendo keeps creating the same things over and over again, and people took notice this generation. The WiiU was a trash fest of okay but ultimately forgettable games. Save for Bayonetta 2 and Splatoon, I'd say the WiiU is better off forgotten."
