30069,"&gt;Five, maybe six good games.

-Bayonetta 2

-Mario Kart 8
-Windwaker HD
-Twilight Princess HD
-Super Mario 3D world
-Splatoon 
-Hyrule Warriors
-Mario Maker 
-Donkey Kong Country 

All exclusive to the Wii U and these are just what I could think of off the top of my head and not to mention the cash printer that is Amiibo. What good exclusives do the PS4 and Xbone have? I can only think of bloodborne and halo although I'm sure there are more. My point is that although the Wii U is losing the console race by far this generation it's hardly ""shit"" and I believe that the Wii U is the most memorable console this gen."
