NX exclusive? No way. That would mean that the Wii U would be the first Nintendo home console to not have a new Zelda game. I am 100% confident that Nintendo is not going to let that happen. "

Also don't forget that the two main games that should have come out for Christmas last year, Star Fox Zero and Zelda Wii U, got delayed as well. And then there is Twilight Princess HD released just recently. "
