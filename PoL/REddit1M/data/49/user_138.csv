But the original comment implies that it wont be coming out to Wii U... Which is stupid.  "
73078,"Yes, but I wish Nintendo would just put out some fucking news about it. They hyped it up so much at E3 2014... and then at the Game Awards 2014... it's been a year and a half since we've seen or heard any significant news. I don't mean to sound like a demanding fanboy, but god damn it... "
73261,I do love a good bridge moving scene though
96233,"If you look at every title individually, I really think Skyward Sword just doesn't hold up the same as the previous titles. Every console Zelda has been getting progressively less good. While I personally loved Twilight Princess, I totally understand the criticism and think it was definitely a step back in many regards from Wind Waker. I feel the same way about Wind Waker towards Majora's Mask and Ocarina of Time. Skyward Sword was just... lacking, in so many ways. "
