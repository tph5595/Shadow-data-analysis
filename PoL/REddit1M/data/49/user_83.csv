I want something they worked really hard on, they took their time on, and is amazing; rather than something they threw together to beat a deadline. I say take your time Nintendo if it means you're going to make something to compete with Ocarina of Time in it's era. "

110650,Precisely. Oh yeah I forgot about that painfully long intro section. Gah. So many things hold this game back. Also there is no excuse for the Wii controls being this bad. It was late in the Wii's life. Should have known how to do it by then.
