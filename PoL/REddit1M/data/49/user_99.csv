32211,Oracle of Ages has baby Link.
32373,"But we know the year, this year."
32494,"May's too close to E3 for a direct. Last year was an anomally, and having that Direct hurt their E3 presentation."
32565,"Well, we got 13 seconds of glorious horse riding in November, so it's only been a couple months, right guys?"
32618,"Oh, they were Dashing. Link was whooping like 17 times in a row."
32677,Kinky.
32851,"1. Zelda games rarely get delayed twice.

2. It would have been, they got side-tracked.

3. They literally have to release this year before gamer blue balls sets in to a great detriment of the sales.

4. We have no reason to believe it will be delayed again, especially considering how much time they took before absolutely confirming it for 2016."
33000,Play some fan games?
33088,"I believe it's called Super Hyrule Historia. They're working on Hyrule Historia Turbo, though."
33432,Maybe in the new Zelda Collector's Edition.
33515,"...formula of the first 3? 3 was completely different. Besides, I have every confidence that they will have saved the baby and put it in some clean bath water with this."
33749,"Is it now? I suppose Nintendo learning nothing from the WiiU and rushing the next console out to market even with a new CEO at the head is also the most likely course of events? As for the delays, delays happen. They delayed Skyward Sword, but that wasn't to put it on the WiiU. They ""keep"" delaying it (only one delay) to add more stuff to it."
34248,"What about ""here's a buffet of 8 dungeons, of which you need to only complete 5."""
106927,"Not quite. FF15 has only existed under that name for a very short amount of time, and has had extensive advertisement campaigns about it. Meanwhile, Zelda has been awaited under the same name for 5 years with very little information, people do not feel as secure. If it doesn't come soon, they will abandon hope to ever get relief."
4603857,"Yeah, so? We had no reason to assume that this would happen, nor is it necessarily a good move. In fact, it is likely a very bad move. It's killed a lot of hype for the game, and it's going to be an uphill battle to reclaim that hype."
