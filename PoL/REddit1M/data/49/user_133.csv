68972,"I can see it now, Link has slipped into another limbo like nightmare realm and is on a quest to find an artifact that will speak to the windfish and request its help to carry him home, the game ends with the windfish depositing Link in hyrule castle, unfortunately its the Hyrule Castle from the Wind Waker era"
69178,"I think the rumours are based on next to nothing , they are conveyed speculation, not extrapolation of clues or tidbits of info, the Wii was in the same directly compatible hardware line to the GC and there is nothing to suggest backwards compatibility, all the Nintendo official statements about NX talk about how *different* a concept it is, making it seem like a port would be harder than ever before for the company. the game has been built from the ground up to utilise the gamepads screen and motion features for example and the NX may lack motion controls and a second screen if its not a follow up to the Wii in any meaningful fashion"
69388,"pretty normal, the home consoles average out at about 1.5 unique Zelda titles each don't they ? they are around 6 years apart (the consoles) - in the meantime WWHD, TP-HD, ocarina and Majora in 3D, link between worlds and triforce heroes (not counting that beat em up) - we do pretty well really"
75336,I know its considered doubling up and I know we haven't got a prayer but I would have killed for Nintendo to take Grezzos work on MM and Ocarina 3D and bumped them up to 720p 60FPS on wii U with the gamepad screen subbing for the 3DS touchscreen. the models and textures have been improved - don't have the technical knowledge to know if the work required would pay off in sales
597729,I am astonished how fitting that was - just wanna see his reaction when he sees the goatee that has appeared on his face
