17425,"~~I'm not sure it was ever confirmed, though it does make a ton of sense if you think of it. He says a few things like, ""Let teachings of old pass on to you"" and the songs you howl to find him are mostly songs from OoT. He says he's a Hero of old, and he's here to aid the new Hero of the Gods in his quest, which IMO implies that he has more importance than just being some heroic dude.~~

[nvm, in Hyrule Historia they say he's the Link from OoT and MM](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Hero's_Shade)"
36428,Isn't that how all fiction works?
37204,There's plenty of in game evidence. It just wasn't said outright 
38250,"Literally all the stuff I crossed out before looking at the wiki. 

It's evidence. It doesn't prove anything in itself, it just supports the claim. You can choose to disagree with Hyrule Historia, but that book isn't a fan work, it's considered canon. Hero Shade being the Hero of Time is just as canon as the official timeline, which was also made up. Zelda is a work of fiction and part of that means that the creators can say whatever they want about it and it's then canon. "
39413,"I understand that the evidence doesn't prove anything, like I said. It just is in line with what is said in HH. Fact is, HH is the closest we can get to true or false, which is why it's quoted all the time and why people point to it in cases like this. 

If you have an alternate theory, I'd love to hear it along with what evidence you have to support it, but the Hero Shade being the HoT is the most plausible theory I've heard. "
