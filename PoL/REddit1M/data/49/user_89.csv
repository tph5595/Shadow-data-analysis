27233,"&gt; The Nintendo community needs to start calling the big N on this shit before they go under.

What a crock of alarmist malarkey. Nintendo is fine now, they'll be fine in 6 months. They'll be fine in 15 years. Handheld platform is fine and slated to improve market share through the NX, home platform is underperforming but it's sure as shit better than the Wii. Plus, WiiU was/is doing 1080p60 better than any other console could hope. 

Take the good with the bad. I'll forgive the Wii U for having less content if that content is better, and it has been. Zelda U will probably rock on the Wii U, and if it doesn't, I'll eat something. A sock, I guess. "
