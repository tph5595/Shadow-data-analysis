44580,"Right, so did darkhorse make the official time line that was released within Hyrule Historia? No. Nintendo did. And I'm sure Nintendo added the thing about the heros shade being the HoT as well. "

84879,"There's always the possibility that the nx could be another weird gimmicky console. But from the rumors I've heard, it seems Nintendo is actually making a powerful console this time around. Which is why I think the nx version might be better. On a more powerful system, I'm sure the new zelda would at least look a little better. "
