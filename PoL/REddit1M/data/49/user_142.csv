82426,at last years E3 Regi said there will be more informations about the NX in Early 2016. since they didnt showed anything it is possible that we see it at this years e3
82756,"the GC version was of TP was better than the WII version. IF Zelda U will come to NX, it doesnt mean that this version will be better.

what if the NX will be a hybrid closer to the 3ds? do you think a game on this console would be better?"
