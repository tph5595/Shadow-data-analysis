Honestly, there are a handful of things in that book that I think are spurious for not being the simplest and most natural way to put things together, but this one is pretty good. I was glib about it above, but some of the links people have posted below make a pretty good case based on nuanced but bountiful clues, which were almost the only kind of clues we had for the entire Zelda timeline theory before that book came along and not very poetically set a lot of it in stone."

A simple page layout error doesn't invalidate deliberately constructed points in the book. 

Personally, I think the idea of a third timeline is unappealing but acceptable if the explanation was good enough, but predicating it on the death of Link rather than any other explanation for his disappearance is clumsy, poorly-researched writing. -But you're not going to convince anyone of that using the graphic design equivalent of typos as your evidence."
