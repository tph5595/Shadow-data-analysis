34062,"I don't know if it's ""the best"" but I like to cook up potions for cash.  Anytime I see Beedle, I buy all six of whatever ten-rupee critters he has for sale (he almost always has three of two kinds); each ten rupees then becomes 100-300 rupees depending on the monster parts I have on hand.

I also sell any dish I didn't cook (meat that froze/cooked upon falling on the ground or cooked dishes that monsters drop) or any dish I cooked but don't really need."
