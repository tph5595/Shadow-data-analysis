63787,I'm fighting that centaur in Zora's domain and I'm just wondering if I got here too quickly. Even if I dodge his shit and flurry attack the shit out of him it only takes out like 1/10th of his power after like 5 minutes of fighting. All my best weapons broke at this point and I'm just using Zora spears. Should I abandon Zora's domain and go somewhere else?
