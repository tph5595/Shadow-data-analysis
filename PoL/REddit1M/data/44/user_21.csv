8974,"Ah, thanks for the correction. There aren't any post-boss chests. I was able to get all of them, anyway. I just don't recall the one you mean in particular, and I can't go back and check. 

Just wanted to confirm that you can get it right now, though, so if nobody comes by with a hint, keep trying!"
24766,"In the 3DS virtual console, there are a ton of zelda games available on the cheap. I recommend playing A Link to the Past first, as it pretty much established many of the conventions that Zelda games since have leaned on (except BotW). Then play OoT, which takes LttP as a base and moves into the 3D world.

After that, if you liked LttP more, get Link Between Worlds. If you like OoT more, play Majora's Mask. 

Honestly though, you can't really go wrong. 

Edit: time starts with t, not c"

You also have some new features in your map and quest log now."
