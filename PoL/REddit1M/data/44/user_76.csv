43469,Did anyone else get version 1.1.1 update? I just did and it's 8:16 pm central time. I played earlier and didn't have any update. I searched briefly online and on this subreddit and didn't see any results. Not sure what was updated or if I missed an update recently.
45658,"I also got the ""Download Complete"" and had to restart BOTW. And I noticed in the bottom right it said version 1.1.1 on the title screen. Then I posted and I haven't gotten anything else since then. Still can't find anything on it yet. Any luck?"
46200,I guess people are reporting that the frame rate issues are better now. I haven't seen anything else about what else was included.
