2630, Even bokoblin will drown. I think only lizalfos can swim.

If you don't have any it is indeed pointless to activate it."
8171,you've got to get in from the outside

But he's definitely doable. sell all your ores to buy the soldier set at hateno , go to the kakariko great fairy to upgrade your equipment to lvl 1, loot at least 5 iron shrooms nearby (or buy some fortified pumpkins) to cook some lvl 3 defense boost meals and stock up on weapons (there's a stable north west of duelling peak towers where you'll find hestu if you want to increase your inventory space). stock up on hearthy meals as well if you can to get some bonus hearts.

It's gonna take you some time as he have 2k HP, but if you're well prepared he shouldn't be that much of a problem when most of his attacks do less than a heart of damage

a good way to get durable weapons is to buy the house at hateno if you can, as there's gonna be two iron hammers there that respawn over time (12 dmg, 40 durability). there's also a two handed zora sword behind the zora domain shrine"
