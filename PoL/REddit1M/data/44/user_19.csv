Once you have upgrades, then really start mix and matching for effects, but set bonuses will be nice for certain situations. For example: I love using the Climbing set while just running around exploring because it makes climbing so much easier, but when I am coming up on enemies I usually switch to the Shiekah set if I want to sneak up on them or the full Guardian set if I'm just blatantly attacking. Honestly, fighting Guardians at this point is laughable to me because I only take like 1 heart's worth of damage from their laser beam. The most frustrating part is waiting for Link to stop rolling around and stand back up."

Especially if I'm going to a new area like Death Mountain where you literally cannot survive without special armor or elixirs, I'll go and buy the armor first and then worry about what else to buy. Other than that, my money is mostly just used to keep stocked on arrows or for buying certain rare bugs or monster parts that I come across in shops."
