5509,"I was getting destroyed by these too, but once I slowed down and watched their patterns it became simple.  I just beat a major test of strength without taking one hit.  


1.  For the first half of the fight, pay attention to their actions before they attack.  For example, with the big blade, they will flip it over before swinging.  Watch the timing while out of their range, then the next time it attacks do a backflip and flurry attack.  


2.  When it spins, get behind a pillar.  Easy.


3.  When it does the spinning laser, use your paraglider and fly right at the Guardian.  When you get close, hit your attack button and slam down on him.  It will cancel the laser and let you get a few more shots in.


4.  When it starts doing the 4 big blasts that take a while to charge up, attack while it's charging.  When it's about to start shooting you should run in a tight circle around the Guardian and all of its shots will miss by a mile.  Then attack. 


Rinse and repeat, you should have no problem once you figure out the basics. "
52484,"Agreed, but standing behind a pillar requires less button presses/coordination, and I was going for a very simple explanation.

53187,I bought the official guide just to piss my friend off.  He gave me so much shit for using the guide to beat the Water Temple when OoT came out.  No regrets.  Fuck the Water Temple.
53456,Correct.  And I think the NPC for the skeleton horse is just east of the bridge that crosses the river (inlet?) south of Lake Hylia.
