14483,"The best way I've done it is to fast travel to the Lake tower, paraglide to the bridge tower closest to you, build a fire and wait until night. If the dragon isn't there just sit at the campfire again. 

Then you just have to be really patient and wait until it's v close to the tower. Jump off right into its updraft and get directly on top. Slow mo shoot your arrow down and you can't miss if you're close enough. Stay in the updraft until you see the shard fall and grab it. 

This way you're not paragliding until you need to and wasting stamina. Rivali's gale is also useful if you have it. "
15192,Yeah - it's definitely tricky. I just get as close as possible and if you're directly above it you can see where the scale goes more easily.
