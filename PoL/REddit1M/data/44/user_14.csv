6104,"I've noticed that sometimes weapons that I have used revert to being unused. It seems random, but maybe it has to do with the goddess springs? Last time it happened was when I dropped Dinraal's scale in the Spring of Power. Can anyone confirm that this does revert your weapons to perfect condition? Or is this just some type of glitch?"
