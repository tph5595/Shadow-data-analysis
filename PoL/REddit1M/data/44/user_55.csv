20634,"I'll add to the good tips by KlopeksWithCoppers:

* A normal arrow to the eye will stun it. This is how I stop the spinning attack, during it's spin prep time.

* Stasis+ will also stun it, causing it to stop doing whatever it was trying to do when it unfreezes. If I'm up close, I'll stasis+ for the stun, rather than an arrow to the eye, because hitting the eye from up close can be difficult, due to the exaggerated motions you need."
