7120,"&gt; Defense of 15 with climbing gear is not the same as defense of 15 with soldier armor

Source on this? From everything I've seen, 15 defense is 15 defense no matter how you get it. The Solider armor has a higher defense value than most other armor at the same level, but I don't think there's anything special about it that makes you take less damage than any other armor with the same value."
7654,"Did you go up through the multiple levels around the edges? There are a bunch of enemies there that have strong weapons, though the exact types will depend on how far you've progressed in the game. 

Apparently in the late-game everyone here carries elemental weapons. I went fairly early on and found a bunch of Royal equipment -- not the best, but pretty decent compared to what I had at the time."
16652,"All of the Zelda-character amiibos give you a variety of ""loose"" items each time you scan them, plus a treasure chest that can contain special weapons/armor, gems, or regular items. 

For example, Smash Bros. Toon Link will give you a bunch of different fish, and his chest can contain the Cap/Tunic/Pants of the Wind (Link's outfit from Wind Waker) as well as the ""Sea-Breeze Boomerang"", a unique boomerang from WW. Sheik will give you a variety of mushrooms, and his chest can contain Sheik's Mask, a unique piece of headgear.

There's a chart [here](https://rankedboost.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild/amiibo-item-unlocks/) that has a pretty good summary of what each amiibo gives you. Just keep in mind that the unique items are random; you'll always get a chest, but it may just have ice arrows or a regular sword or something inside."
28166,"I bankrolled most of my adventure by hunting. Larger animals (elk, wolves, bears, etc) will drop Prime Meat and Gourmet Meat. Five Prime Meats can be cooked together and sold for 210 rupees, and five Gourmet Meats can be cooked together for 490 rupees.

By hunting animals I saw while I was naturally exploring throughout the game, I earned enough money to buy the house, unlock all four fairy fountains, and pay for all of my other miscellaneous needs. 

Some people prefer the bowling minigame as a way to get quick cash; if you're just trying to farm rupees then it probably is faster, but hunting can be done while you're also looking for shrines and Korok seeds.

Selling gems is probably fine too. You'll need some for upgrading armor, so you might want to save 30-40 of each type for that, but if you need quick cash then gems are a good source. You can always find more."
55250,"For an extra 2 rupees apiece, it's not really worth the hassle though. In the time it takes to teleport to that stable and talk to the guy three times, you could have hunted up another couple hundred rupees' worth of meat."
