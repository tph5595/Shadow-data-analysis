18257,"BoTW is my first Zelda game. 
Now I want more. I do have a 3DS, so I would like to know which title should I try first.
I know OoT 3D is great, should I start from it?
I know people have different tastes, so if you can recommend about 3 titles that I must try on 3DS platform would be great.
Thanks!"
