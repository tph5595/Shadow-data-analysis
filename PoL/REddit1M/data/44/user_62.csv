26633,I tried to play this spoiler-free blind and as a completionist however I found out there are 900 korok seeds and that you only get a tactical advantage from getting about half of them.  I know this because the internet says so but would it be clear to me as the player when I max out my stats that there really is no need to get all the seeds?  For instance does Hestu explain to you that he's done all he can for you once you get the four hundred something amount of seeds?
