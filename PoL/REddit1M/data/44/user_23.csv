8026,"I have already defeated Ganon and I find it a bit strange that the game doesn't change Hyrule Castle and stuff like that as if Ganon disappeared, instead doing a save and making Link start as if he hadn't deafeated him.

I feel like it would be much cooler if Ganon disappeared and everything was ""normal"" again and (for example) new missions and quests appeared or something like that, because I don't know what else to do if not end shrines, secondary missions and stuff...

So my question is if there is what things can I do whhen I end the game?"
