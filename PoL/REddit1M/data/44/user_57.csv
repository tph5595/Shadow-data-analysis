22112,"Seconding the thunder weapons / thunder arrows suggestion! I was getting stomped by the modest and major tests until I wondered if they'd get zapped by electricity. It disrupts them enough to get some two handed weapon swings in without taking damage. 


I'd also recommend attack up boosting food and yellow heart food for the major tests - they have so much HP that the attack boost is a huge help in making them die faster (and the faster they die the less of their attacks you have to avoid)."
