13570,"Ugh I need to get Farrosh's scale for a shrine in the Lake Region but (s)he doesn't spawn every morning. I actually shot it twice; first time I fell into the lake with no stamina and had to warp away, so I lost the scale. Second time I shot it over the bridge, but I was out of stamina and low on health so when I hit the bridge I died. This is incredibly frustrating. Any tips?

Also, which shrines can you only do after doing the main quests?"
14493,Do I have to do this to get a scale? Or can I just wait it out over the lake?
14559,Thanks! I have trouble determining if I've dislodged the scale because of all the electrical surges surrounding the dragon.
16299,Thanks! I usually just panic and fire immediately. Patience is key I suppose.
