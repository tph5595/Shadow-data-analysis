I was able to get 'that horse' on first try with an amiibo. However i used it an an area where the horse can't get off. Will the amiibo be able to drop the same horse in the future or is it a one-time thing?"

I was amiibo'ing using my friends' amiibo when i lucked out by getting the horse on first try. unfortunately I was in the Zora region where it's a bit cliffy with streams all over the place. "
