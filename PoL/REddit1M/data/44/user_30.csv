10787,I don't know if this is the case or not but I noticed it after I prayed to turn in some spirit orbs. It might have happened before then but that's when I noticed it. I'll have to try tonight and see if it works. 
433075,Sorry it's been a while. I prayed at one of the statues and nothing happened with my weapons. Maybe it is only the springs that do it.
