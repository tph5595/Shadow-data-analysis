6386,"In the Vah Rudania, there is a chest behind a locked door near the terminal that is by the map terminal that I can't find anything to open it with. No switches, no balls, no torches.

Did I miss something or do I need to beat the boss first to unlock the door?"
7482,"That's not how it technically works actually. You can't enter again after you touch the terminal after beating the boss. The game will warn you at that point, allowing you to finish up anything before doing so. On the Madoh I found a chest I missed after beating the boss but before touching the terminal.

I'm just wondering if the door is boss related or not because I can't find anything that unlocks this door.

That's all the chest in the Rudania done."
9780,"I was able to find it, it was cleverly hidden with an outside opening. 

Man this area did really well to make me miss the obvious. In the Northern Mine I didn't walk onto the first cannon by the Goron, so I didn't get the small dialogue about how you can turn the cannons. When I finally get to the vault, I spend 30 minutes trying to figure out how I can destroy these seemingly invincible rocks (I tried everything: All arrow types, bombs, rest of runes, ice weapons, blunt weapons), since at that point none of the cannons faced the rocks and I didn't know I could turn them.

Almost came here for that. Would have been quite funny had I not gone back and messed with each cannon till I got the dialogue about it as a last resort."
