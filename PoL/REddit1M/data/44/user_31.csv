10911,"Two questions:

* When I have the Goron power charged (the defensive one), is there anyway I can use my shield instead and just use it to properly protect attacks I couldn't block? I was training deflecting guardian laser yesterday and even when I deflected it properly it'd still use one protection!
* I was walking through Akkala at night, and saw an ABSOLUTELY FUCKING MASSIVE SHADOW OF A DRAGON FLYING OVER ME HOLY SHIT. It surprised me so much that I took too long to look above and couldn't see any dragon. Is this a common occurrence?

This game keeps surprising me!"
