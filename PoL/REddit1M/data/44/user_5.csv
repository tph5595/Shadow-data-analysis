2133,"Off top of my head I'd say around 15. There are Minor, Modest, and Major tests of Strength. Minor test Guardian scouts have only one weapon and the least amount of health, you should be able to beat those just fine. If you see that it's a Modest or Major ToS, I'd recommend you just leave the shrine and come back to it after you've got more health and stronger weapons. Modest ToS Guardians have good weapons (possibly one shield) and they have more health. Major ToS Guardians have up to 3 very good weapons (one could be a shield) and I think 1500 health. 

I'd recommend using thunder arrows against them as it stuns them and you can get in a few hits. "
2267,"3, minor, modest, and major"
2381,"For your second bullet, you can go back and beat the Guardian scouts in any Test of Strength shrine after a Blood Moon. Make a note of which ones have shields and beat them as often as you need to. "
3210,"Yeah, that's from a major ToS shrine. Best save those for later. "
4595,"Yeah, I think there were maybe 2 of those? I seem to remember there was one around the bottom right corner of the map. "
10131,"Ah, they're 3000? Maybe the Modest ones have 1500 then, I stopped using the Champions tunic early on after I got matching armor sets. "
