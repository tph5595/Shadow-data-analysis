9867,I have beaten all 40 Talus but I don't have a medal. Where do I get it from? I thought it was from the shop that only appears at night but I don't get anything. Or do I have to beat them all within the same Blood Moon cycle?
10322,"Ah so it is a post game thing? In that case I will not worry. Business as usual then. Thanks!

Now I just need to focus on quickly getting Topaz. I need 50 of them before I move onto Star Fragment collecting"
62449,I am upgrading all armor. It is going to take a while.
