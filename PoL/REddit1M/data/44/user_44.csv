16216,"What is the point of the stamina wheel for running besides padding out the game?

One of the most frustrating things for me personally was that stupid stamina wheel for running. This world is enormous, just let me fucking run. 

I understand stamina for climbing and gliding. Those are like challenges to be solved. Can I up that mountain or no? is there ledges close enough to reach? Can I reach that spot with a glide? get over that hole without running out? etc. 

but running has absolutely no significance. There is not a single thing to be 'solved' by managing a stamina wheel while running. Am I missing something? Was there something to be accomplished with the stamina bar with running that I missed?"
