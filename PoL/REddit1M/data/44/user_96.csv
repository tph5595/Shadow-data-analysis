75482,"Uhm, how is a better defense going to help him, if his problem is that he doesn't have enough weapons?

I had the same problem with my first major test of strength. I was in there with a couple 20 damage weapons. If those weapons break at 50% guardian hp, all the defense boost in the world doesn't help. 

Of course you can always finish the guardian with bombs. They don't do lots of damage though, so it may take a while..."
