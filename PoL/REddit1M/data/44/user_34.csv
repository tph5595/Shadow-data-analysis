If you gen get a level two or three defense boost it will go by a lot easier. Elemental arrows also help when you get a good opening."
13758,"That's normal. Most of the armor will have roughly the same defense (roughly: the soldier armor in hateno village has more than the hylian set, but an upgraded hylian set will surpass unupgraded soldier armor). You don't buy better armor like a normal RPG, you just upgrade the armor you have.

13869,iirc it was an ancient core.
20160,I meant an upgraded Hylian set will be better than a stock soldier set. Edited for clarity.
95369,Chill. He's asked about finding 'far better' armor. In most games with different sets of armor you just buy better armor later on. He's not going to find better armor anywhere: in BotW an upgraded Hylian set will be better than anything you can find in stores or while exploring. If you're coming to this game from something like Witcher 3 there's no reason to hold onto your first set of armor because even upgraded you'll find something nicer later.
