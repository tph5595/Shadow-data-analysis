59797,"My time to finally shine!  

I got sick of being strapped for cash and started selling gems, only to realize that diamonds were needed to rebuild weapons. So I tried a theory, I took a photo of the biggest gem deposit I could find on Death Mountain, and it registered. So I used my Shiekah Slate+, had it ping for the rare gem deposits, and went nuts. 

It took me about 3 runs to really figure out the spawns but on my 3rd run I found nearly 20k rupees worth of gems in just about an hour, leaving 5 topaz, rubies, diamonds and sapphires and 10 amber and opal in my inventory and selling only 2 diamonds. Over my 3 runs I have made about 50k in rupees and literally could buy whatever I want. I have over 100 of each type of arrow and own al the armors in the game opened 3 great fairies and bought the super mega upgraded house with 18k still in my wallet. Bowling sounded too monotonous to me and this was by far the most reliable time to cash investment I found. 

If you do this I highly suggest you do one run, then buy the house, mainly because it gives you a free sledge hammers and a place to dump weapons while you mining because you will go through about 3 sledge hammers if you take out the 3 talus on death mountain (which are stupid easy with ice arrows). 

Feel free to ask me anything if you need more info. If you ever mined in WoW this is about the same as that. "
