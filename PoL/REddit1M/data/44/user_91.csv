64634,"The best spot I found was the center of Floria bridge. Just teleport to the shrine behind the stable after midnight and run to the bridge. Farosh should spawn right away from the waterfall. He will go towards the bridge so glide up with the gusts and fire away. Very easy to aim at his horns because you're definitely up close and personal! Glide, shoot arrows at different levels to ensure you get at least one hit (I usually do 3), glide again to watch where the part falls, and VOILA! Never failed me once. He's the easiest. Hope that helps. Happy hunting!

EDIT: I just went back to double check what I initially thought. Farosh does spawn after 9 pm. I remember a few times I made it over before midnight and he spawned. I literally just slept in my house, woke up ""at night,"" and then teleported over there and he came floating out of the waterfall. Gives me time to go catch another dragon!"
