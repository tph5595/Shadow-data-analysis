9243,"You can find new elemental weapons in the wild, they're actually not quite as rare as you'd expect. I know there's a great frostblade chilling inside Hyrule Castle thrust into the ground somewhere that'll respawn every blood moon, also if you're far in the game (I'm assuming you are since you've done tarrey town), the coliseum in central Hyrule will have bokoblins, moblins, and lizalfos carrying all the elemental weapons. 

To answer your question, I don't think so--but not positive.

Hope this helps.

Edit: actually answer original question"
