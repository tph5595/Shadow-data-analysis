27825,"Two questions:

First, how many shrines are ""locked"" behind a shrine quest of some sort? I've finished 88~ shrines so far and I'm trying to figure how many more may be quests I haven't found.

and second: I've nearly beat the game on the Wii U, but might be able to get a Switch soon...There's no way to transfer saves between the systems, right? Because I kinda don't want to give up all that hard work just to be able to play anywhere &gt;.&gt; But I also want a Switch because its a smaller footprint (and my desk is currently pretty packed with stuff)."
33264,I count 29 shrine quests that i have acquired or completed... so 29/42 means i still have about half of em to find ;-;
