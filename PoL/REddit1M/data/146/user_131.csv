43840,"It's ok that you're not going to buy it, but you can't blame Nintendo for not treating it like an AAA title. Their involvement in this game is minimal, only providing assets and making sure the game meets Nintendo's standards.

It's a spinoff, you can**'t** expect them to treat it like they will treat the next main Legend of Zelda game.

**edit**"
