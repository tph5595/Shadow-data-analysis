42826,There is no lore in Mario. It is all standard tropes to contextualise a game. Mario has a moustache because he needed a defining feature and it was easy to do given the  graphical limitations of the time. He likes cake because they needed a simple reason for Mario to go to Peach's castle in Mario 64. Bowser steals stuff so that Mario has a reason to stop him. Mario is a great example of how lore doesn't matter in a game and the devs just go with whatever works and doesn't clutter the experience to much.
