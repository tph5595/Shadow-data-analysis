41377,"1) this game is not canonized to the actual storyline. It's a spin-off.

2) While you are correct in that it is always essential to stick to some core roots, roots always grow and dig their way toward new grounds. When you chop off those roots and expect a franchise to grow, it usually falls short. 

3) Zelda is not about sword slashing, stylized fighting, but this new game looks like some mindless fun with one of our favorite games. Soul Calibur 2 was pretty epic, wasn't it? "
