20597,"I am fully of the mind that if you don't like something, ignore it. We have had Wind Waker HD, A Link Between Worlds and now this title coming out all within a year's time. It's safe to say that they are focusing heavily on Zelda, and with ZeldaU promised and rumors of Majora's Mask 3D/HD (finger crossed on my end for HD, they would get a WiiU sale from me in a nanosecond) it's not slowing down. Fans of other franchises might even complain about the Zelda heavy output. The point is, and I think everyone who is up in arms is missing, there's something for everyone either here or will be here soon. There is literally no reason for getting upset over not liking something. Just move on and wait.   "
