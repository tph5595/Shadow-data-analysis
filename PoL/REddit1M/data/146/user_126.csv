33459,Project M is a joke that butt hurt Melee fans made because they could not accept the fact the Brawl was different from melee. Instead of being a bland copy of it that we all know good and well that if they did make it like Melee it would have gotten shit on like the NSMB series is for not changing anything. So yeah I don't want smash 4 to be like Melee. So f project M I want new stuff not a shallow imatation of an old game coded poorly and will crash for no reason made by self righteous hipsters that think that a reskin with new moves and pointles tweaks are inovative and better then what the original creators worked their assess off to make.
