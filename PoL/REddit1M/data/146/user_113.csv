I love the elements in that game that fuck things up, because to me, that *is* Smash Bros. But no, now the hardcore community is slowly turning it into every other fighting game out there. No items, no whimsy, no randomness, nothing other than raw skill-based fighting. Which is fine I guess, but not in Smash Bros."
