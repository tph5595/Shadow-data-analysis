7413,"I've been looking forward to a non-Zelda game set in the Zelda universe. So far, stuff doesn't fit together.

1) Link. I'm sure it can make sense in the story, but Link's gameplay has always been more puzzle-y than combative. We've seen a lot of different incarnations of Link, and their main strength has always been their inventory rather than the sword alone. This looks like a very sword-centric game, with super-awesome-y action moves that don't fit the underdog champion Link has so far been portrayed as.

2) Hordes of evil dudes. Where are they coming from? Who's summoned them? For this amount of evil dudes, there'd have to be a major evil that summons them. A Ganon, a Vaati, a something. The main difference between this and mainline Zelda games is the gameplay, not the story. I feel like there should be a justification for the different gameplay in the story. Hopefully there will be. [Maybe this](http://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1t6w2w/interesting_coincidence_i_found_hyrule/).

3) Generic medieval sword dudes. Granted, the knights (more like guards) of Hyrule haven't always had a particularly interesting design (looking at you, TP), but this looks like something ripped straight out of a Crusade-era medieval game. Hopefully, they're temp models, and more Hyrulian models are gonna be in the final game.

What I hope to see:

1) New champion. We've seen Link beat the incarnations of Demise so many times, and Link's primary attribute is courage, reflected in his piece of the Triforce. The gameplay suggests someone associated with Power rather than Courage.

2) New enemies. The monsters we've seen in mainline Zelda games are randomly appearing, not particularly smart, but most importantly: not particularly organized. These guys are organized, more like an army. New big bad: an organizer, a strategist, someone who doesn't aim to win just with magic or strength, but through strategy.

3) New models. It should look like it belongs in the Zelda universe. This is probably going to happen anyway."

Seriously? This isn't a mainline Zelda game? How could I be so wrong!?"
