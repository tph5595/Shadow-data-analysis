Oh sorry for noticing something guys my bad. I should have known better."
3404,".... Okay? Can't I comment on the content of your picture, or is that not allowed?"
3793,"Well then maybe you should be aware of the content you're posting... It's hardly the fault of me (or any other user) that specific details of your post are brought to attention. (Plus if it made the front page, who cares if people were talking shit).

Anyway man, if you're gonna be into some socially looked-down-upon stuff like My Little Pony (and I don't mean to stereotype, but I assume you're a mid-20's male so..... yeah) then you should learn to deal with criticism of your interests. Don't be so defensive, it makes you look like you're ashamed, and you shouldn't be ashamed of anything you're interested in."
4908,"I don't think I implied I was a victim? In fact, you're the one complaining that people always bash you because of ponies...

Anyway, I tried to convey that I have no issue with whatever you're into in my last post but you must not have picked up on that. I just think it's pretty fucking lame that there's a facebook ""language"", but that has nothing to do with you personally.

But hey, lets just leave this be, I don't want you to feel ostracized because you  like ponies, I was just replying to someone's comment about ""brohoof"" and this snowballed out of control. I had no intention of implicating you or insulting you at all."

70251,"the OP replied to my comment about the Facebook brony language thing and was all pissed off that I couldn't ignore that part of the post and take it for the substance it contained, we went back and forth, apparently OP had posted before and it also had some pony crap in the content, and everyone was ripping into her about it, and she was just tired of being bothered about liking MLP basically."
70333,"Bingo. Other than the fact that the commenter was actually a girl (I know, I thought 25 year old neckbeard too)"
