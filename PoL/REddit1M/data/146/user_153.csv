52880,"That's not true for everything. In fact, I'd say it's not true for this either.

A competitive player's perspective in just about any game can help make the game even more fun. They play a lot and know the game in a much more in-depth way than your typical player. They know which mechanics work, which don't, which could use a tweak, etc. Say what you want, most of the ideas competitive players have about games are good ones.

I mean, who the hell *likes* randomly tripping, for example? Anyone? That was retarded."
53227,You're... missing the point.
53286,What character is that?
53730,"&gt;and I doubt they care about how it plays.

 Excuse my language but... Where the hell is this bullshit notion that competitive, balanced games aren't fun coming from?

You think it's ok to make worse games just because the people Nintendo is targeting don't play enough to give a shit? Is that what you want Nintendo to become? A mass producer of shitty games designed for little kids who don't care if the gameplay is actually good or not?"
53928,Nice English. You type like a pissed off 10 year old.
54533,"I was going to agree with you until you implied that being a fanboy is a good thing.

Also, while I'm sure they're fun games, Pikman and Wonderful 101 just aren't enough for most people to buy a Wii-U. Most people have limited cash and limited time to play videogames these days. They'll need someting bigger than Pikman or W101 to convince them. Zelda, Mario, Metroid, etc... those are the games that sell consoles. Especially Zelda. Mario games are great but I also think it has lost some of its selling power because Nintendo sort of spams Mario games. It's gone from, ""oh, there's a new Mario game out! Looks so much fun, I have to buy it!"" To, ""there's a new Mario game out? Cool. I'll probably wait until the next one in 6 months."""
58984,"Shit. I read it as:

 &gt;Just because you're a poor sport doesn't mean games **shouldn't** accommodate you.

Thanks for pointing that out."
59928,&gt;main-series games.
60712,"Yeah, it was from *your* comment. The point is that all CoD games are main series games. Most Mario games are spin-offs. But they are Mario games nonetheless. They spend so much time making Mario games that they rarely develop new IPs.

Think about what Activision did with Guitar Hero. It was a hit game so they decided to shell out as many GH games as they could. And they're doing the same thing with CoD. Call of Duty was once a great series, believe it or not.

I'm not saying Nintendo is doing is as bad as that but they really should slow down on the Mario games and make some good *new* games."
61295,"You should have been able to understand my point without any further explanation.

Anyway, read my updated comment and then reply. I didn't expect you to reply so quickly so I edited to explain a bit more.

Also, yeah, CoD has a few spin offs but the vast majority of them are main series games. The same can't be said about Mario. Which is why it's not fair to single out main series games for your comparison."
62232,"Zelda, Mario, Metroid, Star Fox, F-Zero, Kirby, and Donkey Kong were all once new series.

The problem isn't that new Franchises get rejected, it's that the new franchises you're talking about weren't good. Or at least not on par with the franchises Nintendo used to churn out. Wii Music was just another gimmicky mii game trying to cash in on the popular music game market that exploded with Guitar Hero and Rock Band. Definitely not what I would call a new franchise."
63082,"&gt;Metroid is not a system seller; the entire series lifetime sales are less than Nintendogs. Skyward Sword didn't do great either, and basically everyone had a Wii, so that's sheer disinterest.

Yeah, because many fans didn't want to play Zelda on a Wii remote with stupid, cartoony looking enemies. Don't get me wrong. I personally loved the game once I gave it a try. It had lors of redeeming qualities. But initially, I was pretty pissed off at how goofy looking it was and I definitely didn't want to stand around in the living room waving my remote around like an idiot.

People got sick of the Wii motion gimmick fast which is why Nintendo had financial problems despite it's initial Wii console sales numbers. People just didn't even play the Wii. It sat in their living rooms and collected dust. The Wii console sucked, quite frankly. It was shit hardware + motion gimmick. The only thing it had going for it was the price.

&gt;MARIO is a system seller, along with Pokemon and the Wii series. Also, I constantly see people whining about Nintendo ONLY making Marios and Zeldas, so it gets annoying seeing people then say they aren't willing to try new things.

No, Zelda is as much of a system seller as Mario. But SS turned a lot of people off with its looks aand the fact that you had to use motion controls.

Also, Zelda games release at a reasonable pace. Mario games of some type come out *all the time.*  I love Mario but they need to slow it down and make some great NEW games. And not shitty Mii gimmicks.

Metroid is a potential system seller too if done right(which they won't ever do)."
67393,"&gt;So what you're saying is that Nintendo makes good, different games, but people don't buy them because they want more of the same old stuff instead of trying something new? Wow, that's, like, what I already said.

No, I'm saying Nintendo makes good games but screw themselves over by making them look childish and silly and trying to force their gimmicks on people. I said Skyward Sword had many redeeming qualities. I didn't say that my original criticisms were wrong. Sorry if I prefer Zelda enemies to not look like Monsters Inc. and ""Where the Wild things are"" characters.

&gt;If Zero Mission, Super, Fusion, Prime, and Corruption aren't ""Metroid done right,"" I don't think you actually WANT a new Metroid game.

I was speaking specifically about 3D Metroid. Not the 2D platformers. But you're right. I admit I spoke without knowing what I was talking about here. The Prime series does look very good. I've only played the 2D games(which I love) and I guess I had a false conception of what the 3D metroid games were like. So, on this point, I admit I was wrong.

&gt;Nintendo's problem is that they're willing to do pretty much anything, but everyone hates them anyway. Nintendo fans beg and plead for Metroid, Star Fox, and F-Zero, but those are consistently mediocre in sales, meaning people aren't actually buying them when they come out. People beg Nintendo to revisit different franchises or make new IPs entirely instead of just more Mario, but when Nintendo makes the much anticipated Pikmin 3 and brand new IP The Wonderful 101, the only game people actually buy is the new Mario.

Wonderful 101 isn't even developed by Nintendo, is it? Iirc, Nintendo is just publishing it. And Pikmin isn't exactly a game with broad appeal.

Nintendo has horrible business sense. They always put out ridiculously underpowered consoles with some gimmick included.

Of course Mario is their biggest seller. Mario is a gaming icon and doesn't require great graphics. In fact, really great graphics wouldn't really benefit Mario at all since a realistic installment would honestly just be really weird.

But Nintendo could be doing so much better than they are. And so could all of their classic franchises.

&gt;No one puts their money where their mouth is; your example of Skyward Sword fits that perfectly, as it was Nintendo's most-worked-on Zelda yet and finally delivered on the promise of good motion control, yet everyone took one look at it and said ""Screw it."" I mean, a cartoony Zelda couldn't possibly be good, right? Remember how the cartoony art style single-handedly ruined The Wind Waker? 

No, Cartoony Zelda's like Wind Waker are fine. Skyward Sword was a different story. Most of the enemies looked retarded, like they had been ripped from a children's book, and Link was wearing baggy brown pants. It just screamed, ""we're specifically targeting children and trying to cover up our crappy console's limitations.""

And the motion thing was an even bigger turn off. They did a way better job with it than I was expecting and I actually came to really like it but I don't think it's that hard to understand why Nintendo fans, who were already tired of the motion gimmick at that point, would be pissed that one of Nintendo's most beloved series went motion only.

&gt;Look, I'm not saying I DON'T want a new Metroid or Star Fox or what have you, but there are VERY REAL and, from a business perspective, GOOD reasons why Nintendo hasn't delivered on such requests. Fans don't know what they want, that has been proven time and time again. We'll get our classic series back, but in the mean time, Nintendo needs to make things that they know we will buy, because we have already told them with our past purchases what those are.

Nintendo screws itself. They could be so much more successful if they would stop making the same mistakes over and over!

* Make inferior hardware that can't play most of the biggest 3rd party titles properly or at all.

* Find some gimmick to draw in kids and their non-gaming parents.

* Make mostly games based around said gimmick(Wii this and Wii that. All with your Mii characters that nobody really cares about and your motion controls that most people get tired of within a week or two).

* Basically ignore the huge online playerbase(seriously, they don't even have a unified account system yet).

If Nintendo made a proper console with competitive hardware capabilities that is easy to develop for, they could attract all of the great 3rd party developers that xbox and Sony do AND they would have all of the awesome Franchises that Nintendo is known for. It would be a dream.

If I could play all of the awesome shooters and RPGs that xbox and Sony AND have all my favorite Nintendo titles on one system... Jesus, there would hardly be any reason to buy the other two systems at all.

Edit: Fixing typos."
85893,"&gt;Then the point still remains. Nintendo tried something new instead of rehashing Ocarina of Time again (which people criticized Twilight Princess for doing) and the newness scared people. You personally may have disliked the art style, but that doesn't make it bad, it just makes it different; many fans and critics actually liked the water color style and the Ghibli-esque creepy-yet-cute feel of the characters and enemies.

I honestly don't believe it was ever a popular opinion that Twilight Princess was a bad game or that returning to the OoT/MM style was a bad thing. What you remember was a vocal minority. And according to the [numbers I found](http://vgsales.wikia.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda), Twilight Princess is the best selling Zelda game of all time(when including both the Wii and GC release) with Ocarina of time coming in at 2nd Place(if you don't count the remake, which puts it ahead). *Clearly* **a lot** of people were excited about the return to that style of Zelda. The numbers speak for themselves.

I'm sure there were quite a few people who liked the art style in Skyward Sword. And, in general, I liked it too. I just wasn't particularly fond of the way enemies were designed. Quite frankly, monsters shouldn't be cute. Especially if they're monsters I'm supposed to kill. And some of them just looked silly. Like, that one you fight on the ship literally looks like a Monster's Inc character. I think the majority would have liked cooler enemies.

&gt;Likewise, the motion controls were praised by many fans and critics, including even yourself when you gave it a chance, yet Nintendo was ""forcing gimmicks on people?"" People hate Nintendo for rehashing old stuff, and they hate Nintendo for trying new stuff; the Big N simply can't please its fans, which is why they just try to do their own thing. The ironic thing is that they are a nostalgia-heavy company; The Wind Waker and Majora's Mask, for example, were both hated on release by many fans, yet now they're everyone's favorites. Twilight Princess has also started to get more love lately, and now I wonder if next gen Skyward Sword will be the new game fans beg for an HD rerelease.

Again, I think you're confusing a vocal minority with popular opinion of Zelda fans. I think basically everyone who played Wind Waker will tell you that it was a good game. A great game even. Even if they, like myself, prefer the OoT/TP style Zeldas.

And I never thought Skyward sword was bad. I think you're confused about the point I'm trying to make regarding Skyward Sword.

I was never trying to say that Skyward Sword was a bad game because of those things. In fact, it's one of my favorites. It had such likeable characters that actually had personalities and backstory. I also loved the way they portrayed the friendship between Link and Zelda. I would like to see more of that in the future.  Also, as I said, the controls are excellent. The point I was trying to make is that those are the reason Skyward Sword didn't sell *that* well(although it didn't flop by any means).

Nintendo took a long time to do anything really great with the Wii motion controls. Can you really blame people for being angry about them using it in Zelda? No game before Skyward Sword had really done anything that amazing with it. I'd argue that it was totally reasonable for people to expect the worst from motion controls in Zelda.

&gt;Won't argue that Nintendo causes many of its own problems; the refusal to take online seriously is completely insane. However, that doesn't change that outside forces are at work (Wii U could have easily run many AAA games that skipped it over the past year and a half, and the launch debacle is unforgivable), and speaking strictly on the subject of 1st party franchises, Nintendo's fickle fans are basically in constant war on the company, and there's nothing they can do about that.

I really think you're exaggerating how fickle Nintendo fans are. I think they're generally pretty supportive of Nintendo's endeavors.

But let's be real, the Wii-U is not a next Gen system. Even if they did manage to get some good 3rd party games that released on the 360 and PS4 in the last year or so, they would eventually be left in the dust in following years. The Wii-U, frankly, isn't going to survive more than a few years. It's not that much more powerful than the 360 and Ps4 were.

Oh, and I'll make sure to play the prime series. It looks fun."
87066,"&gt;I love the elements in that game that fuck things up, because to me, that *is* Smash Bros. But no, now the hardcore community is slowly turning it into every other fighting game out there. No items, no whimsy, no randomness, nothing other than raw skill-based fighting. Which is fine I guess, but not in Smash Bros.

I've never seen any competitive smash player who didn't want items to be in the game. Just because they turn items off in competitive matches doesn't mean they want them removed from the game. I don't know where you heard that from.

Whimsy? Not sure what you mean by that.

The tripping was stupid. Random in a bad way. Random in a, ""what is this bullshit?"" Sort of way. You can't even turn it off if you don't like it.

Randomness can be fun, yes. Which is where items and interactive maps come into play. However, tripping for no reason is NOT fun. If that was fun for you, you're probably a masochist haha(Jk, don't take that too seriously).

Basically what I'm trying to say is that competitive players don't want interactive maps or items taken out of SSB. They want them to be optional, yes. But you'd be hard-pressed to find a competitive smash player who actually wanted those things removed."
87430,"Don't you think evolving, interactive arenas and random item drops are enough randomness?

Tripping me doesn't contribute anything other than getting me killed for no good reason. You can't even turn it off. If you could, I wouldn't have minded it."
101719,You're just being stubborn. Random tripping adds nothing to the game. It's just annoying.
103994,"It definitely does detract from the game. You said yourself you're not good at it. Perhaps that's why it doesn't make much of a difference for you. But I assure you, it does make a difference for many people. Especially people who like to play it competitively. One trip against a good player can be the end of you."
491103,Merry Christmas to you too. But you're either trolling hardcore right now or just don't know anything about technology. Because the Wii-U isn't even that much better than the 360 and PS3. It's nowhere close to the XB1 and PS4
507977,"Yes... better than the 360 and PS**3**. Those are last generation consoles.

But it's extremely underpowered in comparison to what's possible on the PS4, XB1, and PC. Which is going to hurt Nintendo a lot."
510687,Yeah dude... you're way wrong. The Wii U is only slightly better than Sony and Microsoft's last generation consoles. And they've had some pretty serious financial issues in recent years.
