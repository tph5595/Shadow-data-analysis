27394,"I might be able to get into it if it weren't for the fanbase of my little pony. Jesus fuck, if anything is cringe worthy it's how they act and what they do. "
27639,"I haven't been in the sub this month. Could you explain to me exactly what the fuck is going on? We're getting two zelda titles, same year? Do you have a link to them? "
27847,"It's also the fact that it seems to bleed into other things much more easily than other fanbases. I hate crossovers in general, but the more I see a crossover, the more I hate it. "
29484,Arent they both supposed to be 2014 zelda title releases? 
30592,"It would be really sweet if they did. I hope hyrule heroes does really well so nintendo understands that they can do some more innovative things with the zelda series. I wasnt a big fan of skyward sword because it was too hand holdy and every item pick up made me start actively avoiding them, and it was a little disorienting in the dungeons. Never made it past fire dungeon. "
64578,"How do you know that it's a Dynasty Warriors Template? I've only seen one video, and all that's in it is just a teaser of him wrecking hundreds of minions with his attacks. 

And innovative wasn't the right word. Different is what I'm looking for. I was really tired last night. "
65817,"If you watched the video to the end, they said that the name is not final. It's probably going to change to something more catchy/better in general. 

And I don't know who the main character of Dynasty is. "
72204,"Im not saying its not going to be a zelda version of dynasty warriors, I wasnt even really addressing that. I only asked him how he knew it was going to be a dynasty warriors style zelda game from one trailer.

Then I said I meant different, not innovative.  Nintendo might do  different things with zelda if this game does well. 

Then I said that the name is temporary and that I dont know who the main character of dynasty warriors is. I didnt know it had a singular main character.  

So, I never said it wasnt going to be a zelda dynasty game"
98251,I dont give a fuck? Im not sure what you want me to say. I think itll be cool and if it does good nintendo might do different things with the franchise other than just the same old installments theyve been doing. 
161984,"You guys are a bunch of fucking cunts. Yes, I do, you got a fucking problem with that you little fuck? It's different than the rest of the zelda series. It's not an original idea, but it's something other than the same formula that they have been having for the last 14 fucking years, apart from a few differences in the instruments and features, like mask transformations or riding the ocean in a talking boat.

Go get some new insults you mornic cunt. "
194169,"Telling me to go back to cod is as good as one. 

And im not raging. This is how I normally speak. "
