483700,Dude. Have you even read the specs for all three? Wii U has way better specs than Xbox one and PS4. Sit down and have a very merry Christmas. 
506545,"Specifications-wise, it is only slightly better. I may have overexaggerated by a bit. "
508706,"Not necessarily. So far, the lineup for it has been not great, but decent. From what I've read, it is slightly better than xbone and PS4. If I'm wrong, then so be it. But Nintendo is going nowhere. They're by far one of the most financially stable companies. Again, if I'm wrong then I'm wrong. "
