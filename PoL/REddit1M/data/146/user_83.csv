22037,"But there is a lot more to the Wii U than just a new Mario game, and any actual ""hardcore"" gamer would have researched and seen the wonders of The Wonderful 101 and many other games. You know a new core Zelda game is on its way. Do they actually NEED to announce it for you to know it's on the way?"
30628,"Yeah...exactly my point. Baby Bowser is the baby version of Bowser as seen in Yoshi's Island. He fights Yoshi and Baby Mario. Bowser Jr. is Bowser's son. I'm not exactly sure what you're correcting here. And if you aren't and I misunderstood you, then I apologize in advance."
