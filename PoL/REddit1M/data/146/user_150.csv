51296,"...Going off the Dynasty Warriors template isn't being 'innovative', it's the *exact opposite*.

It looks pretty fun, but innovative? lol.  It's been done a million times before."
51440,"This just in:  Some people find different things fun.  I happened to think Melee's precise and skill-based system is a lot more fun than Brawl's sloppy, unrefined, aimed-at-everyone system."
51535,"Yup, and Melee was fun to both, while Brawl is only fun to one.  Get it?"
51605,"Sadly, this is Nintendo's biggest belief lately.  No competition, no difficulty, for the sake of being accessible to people who really don't give that much of a shit in the first place."
51665,"&gt;I doubt they care about how it plays.

wat.

""Hey man, this game kicks ass!  I mean, the gameplay sucks total ass but yeaah it rocks!"""
52204,"Spoken like a true vegetable.

It wasn't about being a copy, it was about being as good, and Brawl simply isn't.  It's not as polished, and it removes features and aspects that made the gameplay a lot more exciting, for the sake of removing competition... in a fucking fighting game.  Wth is a fighting game if it's designed *specifically* to prevent high-skill gameplay?  It's like hosting a boxing match where you're not allowed to dodge.

It was essentially ""let's water this game down so simpler-minded people/non gamers can play it!"", as was Nintendo's big trend with the whole Wii era.

If you can't see these issues, then you're probably one of the people they watered it down for."
52417,"It's almost as if these people have never seen Dynasty Warriors before.  But I suppose if you paint 'Zelda' over it, fans will eat anything up."
63790,"That's a problem between the people playing the game, not the game itself.  If your friend is too much of a dick to play at a level which you can keep up with, there's no reason to play with him in the first place.  Games have good players and less-than-good players.  This is how games work, and it's not a problem that needed fixing.

Things like this are no excuse for gimping an entire game, and to suggest so is pretty ridiculous.  Just because I'm not as good as some people are at certain games doesn't mean games should be dumbed down until everyone else has no choice but to be on my level.

It's like a bunch of guys playing basketball, when a guy who's never played before walks up, demands to play, and argues that there should be no 3-point throws because he can't throw that far."
64849,"The gameplay looks *exactly* the same as Dynasty *Warriors*, it's called Hyrule *Warriors*.. hell, Link even wears the same scarf/shoulder-pad combo thing that the main character of Dynasty does.

132888,Are you seriously saying another Dynasty Warriors clone (which there are hundreds of) is more 'different' than the actual Zelda games?  Same old installments?  Is there something not quite clicking right in your brain?
170651,"So basically, what you're saying is, you want a Zelda game that doesn't play or work anything like a Zelda game...

You should just go back to CoD then, kiddo."
184226,"I don't recall using any insults, kiddo.  Rage more, though, if you insist.  It is somewhat entertaining."
194907,Then you should probably learn to relax some.
