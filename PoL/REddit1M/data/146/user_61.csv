On a similar vein, it always surprised me that StarFox never got a console release last generation. Nintendo has more than just the four or five main series that people would buy tons of copies of."

People like Star Fox, so I can't imagine it being hard to sell. Nintendo can survive on just Mario, Zelda, Pokemon and Metroid, but it has so much more than just those four (amazing) series that could make just as much money."
