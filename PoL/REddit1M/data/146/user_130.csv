36100,"the examples provided were cherry picked. yes, there will always be a few exceptions to the rule. but there are also COUNTLESS games that sucked terribly because they did not stick to their roots. 

Zelda games are NOT supposed to be about sword slashing through large groups of enemies. I would never play a Zelda game like the one they showcased. 

zelda is not supposed to be Diablo 3, or lineage 3, or some other shitty generic ARPG. 

Zelda games have universally been dungeon delving, puzzle solving, rpgs. and they should stick to that. period. "
