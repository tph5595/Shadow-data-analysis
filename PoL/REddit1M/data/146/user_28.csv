8928,I find it really interesting that you hate the community. I thought that's what most fans of the shows were all about.
33604,"I'd venture one of the largest reasons for the mockery and lack of acceptance is the majority (or at least, very vocal minority) of the fan-base that takes the fandom to extreme levels (in the form of furry inclinations and sexualizations). I say this as the former roommate of someone who took his fanboyism to extreme, unhealthy levels. While this certainly happens in other genres as well, I don't think it's hard to dispute that MLP takes the crown there. 

In addition, I would say that the comparisons you made aren't entirely fair. Nintendo, for one, typically portrays characters that (for better or worse) are more socially acceptable. It's not really surprising that a mustached plumber who fights a giant spiked turtle and his cronies is considered more masculine and socially acceptable than a show about ponies and glitter and magic.

Furthermore, there's also the point that yes, Nintendo often (like MLP) targets younger audiences. However, that means today's ""young adult"" age group grew up with Nintendo, unlike MLP, and have an element of nostalgia going for them. As a further example in this, while I don't think current fans of Powerpuff Girls are particularly respected amongst their peers, they're certainly not ridiculed like MLP - because of that time lag. I'm sure in 10-15 years, it will not be unusual to see young adults nostalgic over MLP. "
35706,"I conceded that that type of content exists elsewhere, although as I've said, it at least seems to be much more prevalent in MLP than for other source material. Furthermore, I'm not sure how you take sexualizing a children's show's ponies to be ""non-extreme,"" but I'm not going to get into that topic. 

Besides, that was hardly the main point I was making. And I'm not here to criticize your interests, I'm simply explaining to you why people perceive them so negatively when you don't seem to understand. "
