48267,Sooo can we agree that Mario should have stayed out of space and bowser shouldn't have come for go karting? I don't really think this is the right direction for the franchise.
1104242,But thats what im saying.... I feel like spin offs are for dying franchises that lose their fanbase so they need to test every experimental water to see what the masses will want next. I dont think we have had that problem with any recent Zelda games. I just dont see why they feel the need to throw a 3rd party looking game at us like this.
