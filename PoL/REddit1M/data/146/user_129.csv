35704,"I agree with ZeldaInformer, even if I'm not really looking forward to this at all.

Mostly because Dynasty Warriors has yet to make any significant improvements to its gameplay since like, 3. It's made a few changes here and there, but the core gameplay is still the same essentially thing it's been for, what, 10 or so years now?

Like honestly, 6 doesn't feel very much different from 2 aside from a couple of things. The gameplay has just gotten dull as dirt. Hyrule Warriors does not look to have much difference in the core gameplay.

Unless it ends up being significantly different, count me out."
