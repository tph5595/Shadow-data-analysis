75754,"I've been really regretting my PS4 purchase. I'm sure I'll want one in 2 years but I certainly didn't need it now, I don't have any games for it because there are no good ones in my opinion. I tried Killzone and did not enjoy it.

Never regretted my Wii U purchase though, bought it day one. But then again I'm not expecting any major changes in the hardware, and I've never had a nintendo system break on me. I'm not as optimistic about the PS4, I bet sony is already working on changes."
