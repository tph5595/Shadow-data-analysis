59092,"Because it's a fighting game designed for everyone, not just the high-level players, and certain mechanics allowed such high-level players to win so easily that it made it extremely frustrating for everyone else. "
59242,"Spoiler: As of Call of Duty 2014, there will be as many main-series games in its 11 years of existence as Mario in its 29.

So tell us again how Nintendo spams with new Marios every 6 months. "
60092,Got some context for that quote?
60920,"I know it was from my comment. I said it. You quoted it without explaining at all why you quoted it, made no sense.

&gt; The point is that all CoD games are main series games.

[Well that's just not true.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Call_of_Duty_games) Though I dare say that Mario's spinoffs actually branch out into different types of gameplay, like racing, sports, and fighting, instead of just being more first-person shooters.

See, that's how you quote someone."
61884,"But it is fair. As far as the development cycle, marketing, and even consumer purchase decisions go, Mario Kart et al are independent from the platforming entries (which is actually more than can be said for, say, the portable entries of Call of Duty, which people are likely to pick up if they're fans of the console).

Re: above edit, it's rather closed-minded to think that they exclusively work on Mario, when they're actively working on more IPs than most studios. As far as introducing new IPs go, well, look at how well-received they've been in the past. Spoiler: they've not. The last new IP Nintendo introduced that was received well by the gaming community at large was Pikmin. The best example I think is Wii Music. Miyamoto poured himself into that game, and look how it was treated. Nintendo has learned very much the hard way that when they try to give people new franchises, they get rejected en masse."
66226,"I dunno, maybe it's friends playing at a social gathering, the kind of event the game was meant to be played at?"
67175,"Mechanics that favour skilled players is just poor design for an accessible game. Skilled players should win because of their skill, not because wining rewards them further. However, competitive gaming seems to flock to games with these kinds of mechanics: Melee included, and notably recent entries like Dota 2 and League of Legends. I won't care to ponder why here, but it's a very strong pattern, and as far as games that are meant to be played by everyone go, it's a strong anti-pattern that some developers are moving away from while others move towards. You can call it ""gimping"" or ""dumbed down"" or whatever such loaded term you choose, but the fact remains that for a game meant for everyone to play, it's just bad design.

Edit: An example of this pattern, the Blue Shell. In Mario Kart (indeed any racing game), once you get into the lead you become less likely to be interfered with other racers grouped behind you. This lead will grow and you become less likely to be hit by items. As the race continues this lead will widen and widen, and the likelihood that you will win grows and grows, even though you only applied skill at the beginning of the race, the rest was just cruise control. The Blue Shell counters the anti-pattern, disrupting the confidence that they will remain in the lead and require them to continually apply their skill in order to earn the win properly."
