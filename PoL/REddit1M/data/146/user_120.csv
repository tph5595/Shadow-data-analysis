32459,"Hes being downvoted because the hardcore community only represents a minority of the people who like smash, so it's irrelevant to say that people aren't going to get a Wii U for smash. Aside from the 4-5 people in my school in the smash club, I know TONS of people who love smash and are super hyped for Smash 4, and I doubt they care about it being competitive or not.

Edit: changed stuff to make it more clear."
32658,"Well said. People say that the Wii U has no games, but compared to the PS4 and Xbone, it has tons. I don't see myself getting a PS4 anytime soon (PS3 is the shit though), but I got a Wii U recently and am enjoying Sonic, Mario 3D World, Monster Hunter, Wonderful 101, Pikmin, Wind Waker, and ZombiU (shits scary)."
73180,"Did I *say* that competitive games aren't fun to play? I'll have you know that I do play competitive Smash sometimes. I think you need to check your eyesight, I said most people don't care about how it plays, considering most Smash fans I know were fine with Brawl. Never said competitive ones didn't matter. I seriously don't see how you got that out of me saying that most people don't care."
73207,Yeah thats what i meant. Srry will change
73249,I meant that if its competitive or not. I mean that they won't care as long as its Smash (and obviously still has the same Smash gameplay)
73382,"I just started playing it last night.

Not a good idea, at one point the light in the game went out and the pad didn't work (this was part of the game but I didn't know that) and I started shooting like a bitch and wasted all my ammo... -_-"
73480,"Yeah you got access to all the Wii games as well. So even if there are only a few WiiU games you like, you still have the choice of all those Wii games ALONG with the WiiU games. PS4 and Xbone ain't got that shit!"
