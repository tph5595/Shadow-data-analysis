I think we're more excited at what the Project M guys could do with the new Smash. Project M team are doing a way better job than Nintendo at making an SSB game and SSB4 will definitely be competing against them."

I can play it 4 player, items on, full party game status and i get bored in 30 minutes. It's too damn slow and easy but for whatever reason, casual smashers loved it. 

Hardcore players are gonna play project m but the nice thing about project m is that it's still a party game and if you already own brawl then it's free. You don't have to play it like a competitive fighter and it's way more interesting regardless of how you play. "

Look at what Capcom does with SF4 and MVC. They hired competitive players to consult on the games in order to make a more appealing product and those games sell to the hardcore and casual market. They're fun and not too hard to play around with but still carry a lot of depth in gameplay for the more committed gamers. The competitive crowd is also free marketing as they hype games up like crazy. People watch the tournaments or just listen to their competitive friends talk about games and become more interested. 

Now look at Project M. Created by hardcore fans and if you play Project M, arguing that Brawl is better is going to be an uphill battle. Anyone who plays Project M, regardless of whether they are casual or hardcore, prefers it to Brawl. It's just a better game. This is because the developers understood why the game was fun in the first place. They adjusted speed and gravity, added more characters and abilities, balanced the characters, created new costumes and stages but still kept the core mechanics intact. Basically if you're a SSB fan, casual or hardcore, then it's your dream Smash and it's a game that appeals to all markets. Which in business is what you really want. That's how you make the most money and in this specific instance, it's also how you make a better product. 

Brawl made me sad as a competitive player because it was so spiteful and shitty but even looking at it from a strictly business perspective, it was a poor decision to shun the competitive community in the fighting game genre and while I'm sure SSB4 will be a financial success by name alone, I believe that it'll be hurt by people generally losing faith in Nintendo which Brawl has contributed to and the existence of Project M."
