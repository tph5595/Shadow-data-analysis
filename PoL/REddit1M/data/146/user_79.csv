20674,Why the hell are you being downvoted? What you said about brawl is exactly how the hardcore smash community feels. I was a harcore smasher in '06-'10. SSBM is still played competitively at an insanely high level that brawl can't match. I'm definitely excited about a new SSB but I'm not going to compare it melee specifically because of how brawl turned out. 
65051,"&gt; certain mechanics allowed such high-level players to win so easily that it made it extremely frustrating for everyone else. 

Why would pros play with beginners and vice versa? The people that know the ""advanced"" mechanics of SSBM are a small percentage of gamers.  How hard would it be for everyone else to find someone to have a fun match against?"
69928,Are you arguing my point or agreeing with me?
