63729,But Nintendo has the cheapest consoles and games out there...
64103,"It's something extra that's there for people who want it. It's not hindering the main line of Zelda, so how could you possibly be opposed to the idea or the direction of the game?

It's like DLC. It's there if you want it, but it's extra and optional so you don't have to get it.

I don't understand how anyone could be opposed to more content, especially when it does not interfere with the core franchise."
64195,That's not true. Smash its not a Zelda game.
64955,"But Majora's Mask did stay from its roots.

路Adding new gameplay mechanics such as different playable characters.
路A story different from every other Zelda game
路A ""groundhog day"" type mechanic where you have 3 days to accomplish something or start over.
路Tons of sidequests and optional missions. One of which required the entire 3 days to finish. You meet characters that are more than just nameless faces. You watch their story and how their lives progress over these 3 days.


To say that this game is not a good example of branching away from your roots is bogus. Obviously it had to stick to some things, otherwise it wouldn't have been a Zelda game, but so many other things were different that it made it unique.

Majora's Mask is undoubtedly the most polarizing game amongst the fans. You don't get to be that way without mixing it up."
