8046,I imagine half the reason Bowser kidnaps Peach is to get back at Mario for beating him at go-karting.
8470,So apparently expressing interest what you like is cringeworthy now?
9254,So how is this different from expressing interest in any other thing?
9985,"So? Nearly every single one of Nintendo's top franchises has a target audience of young children. It's because they're also entertaining to adults that we play them.

The same can be said for MLP. The show was created by Lauren Faust (who also worked on The Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends) to be entertaining to everyone."
10099,"Bashing other people for liking ""uncool"" things is shallow and juvenile. ""Coolness"" becomes irrelevant the moment you graduate high school. "
16263,"Nobody worships a cartoon. They just enjoy it and enjoy being part of a community.

It's no different from Pokemon fans enjoying a franchise made for prepubescent boys."
17687,"Not at all. A large part of maturity is realizing that it's okay to like things that aren't quote-on-quote ""mature"".

Just look at the kids who play Call of Duty: they play it because they think it's cool to play a game that's rated M, and hate other games for being ""kiddy"". And yet they couldn't be any _less_ mature."
27448,This is mainly because the MLP fanbase originated on 4chan.
35397,"Furry inclinations and sexualizations aren't really anything ""extreme"". There's porn of virtually *every* fictional character in existence, and furries, while admittedly weird in my eyes, aren't anything worth raising a stink about. Everyone has *some* kind of weird fetish."
73956,"I understand, I just don't think it's very good reason. I don't think sexualizing a children's show is extreme because people on the internet sexualize *everything*.

There's really nothing inherently wrong with looking at porn of a character you like, unless that character is obviously underage."
74557,"That's actually kind of what I like about the fanbase, honestly. MLP has a cast of characters that work extremely well in virtually any setting, so it's cool to see how the dynamics would work in different crossover situations. At least that's how I see it."
