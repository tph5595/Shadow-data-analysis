The character movements felt way too clunky, the constant tripping was a huge annoyance and was extremely unnecessary, and the online play was completely terrible. I never once had a match where i didn't have at least a full second of controller delay.

Plus the fact that they ruined my favorite character from melee really turned me off from the game."
