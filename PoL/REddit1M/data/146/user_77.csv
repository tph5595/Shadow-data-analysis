20280,Any declared Hardcore gamer would have a Wii U already. Especially those who love Nintendo games.
34388,Zombi U made me feel like such a little bitch. I need to finish that game. Too much of a weenie though. Heh
81587,Lol. That's hilarious. 
81791,That's a whole different issue. I meant if a hardcore gamer just outright dismisses the Wii U with no intention of getting one due to it's reputation of not being 'hardcore'.
103290,"I know that. That was not the point. Should the hardcore gamer have the means to attain the console, but chooses not to out of an unfairly judging it as beneath their tastes, then that would be unjust. Not talking bout those who don't have it yet due to funds. Keep saving up! "
