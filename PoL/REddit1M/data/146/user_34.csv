9350,"Just don't look at the comments. It's as simple as that. You've been on reddit for 2 months and that's enough time to know how vicious the internet *can be* towards such a miniscule detail pertaining to something you like and they don't.

I hate when people comment on it but the best thing is to just not bother with the comments. Unless it's an askreddit thread or something like that you really don't need to be looking at them to begin with because they are usually full of ""OP is a fag"" and bad jokes."
