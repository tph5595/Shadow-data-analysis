156514,"The problem is that SSBB was also fun as hell and hardcore *Smash players* are in the minority, even among hardcore gamers. The reason I like Smash Bros is actually *because* you don't have to dedicate your life to it to enjoy it unlike Street Fighter or such, you can play it with friends between other games and it's fine. Tripping was going too far, sure, but over all Brawl is fine for that sort of play, and that sort of play looks to be well-supported once again in SSB4. And hopefully the netcode won't be a complete disaster this time, building on the few years of experience they've had since. It'll be *nice* if it is better for the hardcore Smashers too, but far from important for most of us.

Not that it justifies downvotes, but it's why people don't agree that Brawl was terrible. "

On the other hand, they think things like the wavedashing physics quirk, which requires finnicky inputs to do at all, enhances a game whose big advantage over things like Street Fighter is accessible controls, with the depth coming from prediction, counter-play, and adapting to shifting arenas and random items.

(That said, I do agree that the random extra options of items are way, way more fun and interesting than randomly taking away your core options)

edit: 'bug' and 'big' are different words"

... they both have you using a sword?"
