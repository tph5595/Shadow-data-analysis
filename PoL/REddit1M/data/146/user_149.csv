I have noticed in your posting that:

- You replied with a comment that does not seem to add any content. Rediquette suggests that phrases such as `this`, `lol`, and `I came here to say this` do not add anything noteworthy to the discussion. Why not simply express your opinion with an upvote if you agree, or downvote if the post does not contribute to the discussion, and move on to the next comment/post?
