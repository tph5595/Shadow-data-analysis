If the hardcore gamers don't like Brawl, and SSB4 looks like brawl, they still aren't going to buy a Wii U.

This is the problem that I constantly see with Nintendo subs. ""Uh oh! Hardcore gamer sharing facts! Downvote him to hell to hide the comment.""

Was Melee not fun? For both casual and hardcore gamers? Now, was Brawl? No, Brawl turned away one of the groups. It wasn't until Project M came around and revamped the competitive scene that brought those people back. And, hey, look! PM is still fun for casual gamers. I have honest to goodness not found anybody that hasn't preferred it to Brawl after playing it.

What was said above contributed well to the conversation. I thought it was really positive, and then greatly confused when I saw the ""why are you getting downvoted"" post. This sub needs to grow up some lol

In advance, I'm on my phone so m's and n's may be switched in a few places."
26986,Great. This guy's point is still very accurate though lol.
