8979,"Except this isn't progress, it's Dynasty Warriors. We've already played this game. The fact that you're giving it a Zelda skin doesn't change that at all. Not only that, but the game looks slap-dash and shitty. Maybe that's just the extent of the WiiU's abilities (it's not)."
9212,"No. Not at all, actually. If someone made a Star Wars mod like this, no one would care. Expressing interest in this specific thing, however? Yes."
9647,Other things are socially acceptable and considered cool.
16646,"Did I say it affects Zelda U in any way? Did I say it wasn't a spin-off? I don't recall saying any of that. I'm strictly responding to ZeldaInformer's comment.

He says this game is ""progress"" and likens it to Mario Kart, Super Mario Galaxy, and Majora's Mask, which is a hilariously terrible comparison. Those games are innovative, interesting, and refreshing. This is just another Dynasty Warriors game with a Zelda skin. To compare it to those games is ridiculous.

People can like it if they want, but that doesn't make the game ""progressive."""
17534,But it's not juvenile at all to be interested in a cartoon show for little girls.
