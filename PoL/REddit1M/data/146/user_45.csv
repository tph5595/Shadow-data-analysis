11453,I'm tired of Zelda sticking to its roots. Its struck to its roots in almost every version of the game. In ready for something way different in a Zelda game.

98321,Yeah I am. If Nintendo wants me to keep buying it they need to change it up a lot. You're right Mario has evolved a ton. Mario Galaxy is a completely different game than super Mario bros. And both of those are completely different games than Paper Mario. Its time for Zelda to change something up a bit. It might sound like i hate Zelda but I really don't. Its one of my favorite franchises. Some of my best childhood memories revolve around Zelda on the NES. Its growing a bit stale for me. 
98661,"We all have an idea of what Zelda is. Its Nintendo's job to figure out how to change but still make it feel like Zelda. They done it before. Super Mario Galaxy feels like Mario, but so does super Mario Bros. They are completely different games but to me they feel like Mario. Hell maybe its just me but Mario kart feels likemMario game."
