9280,"If it's anything like Dynasty Warriors, you're gonna be able to play with LOTS of different characters (the latest games got more than 60 or so for comparison). Maybe we'll be able to play as all different Zelda races and modify their gear and stuff, that would be the BEST.

But they could also make Link the only playable character (something weird considering that kind of game works really well with co-op with different characters) and make his combat dynamics very advanced like an actual character action game (Bayonetta/God Hand/Yakuza and the likes).

Or a mix between the two.

This is gonna be interesting nonetheless..."
