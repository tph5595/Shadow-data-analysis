Yes, Link went to Termina, which is not Hyrule. But the gameplay plays like practically every other Zelda game with the exception of having a time limit. Aside from that, everything else is the same, from finding boss keys, solving puzzles, doing side-quests, and fighting monsters. 

Yes, Mario went to space, which is not the Mushroom Kingdom. But the gameplay plays almost exactly like Super Mario 64 and almost exactly like Super Mario Sunshine. Going into space and having some new features and abilities does not a game deviating from its roots make. 

Bowser and Mario Kart... OK, that one kinda counts."
