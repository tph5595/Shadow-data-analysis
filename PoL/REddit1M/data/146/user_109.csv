28270,"well if you think about it link has become fairly powerful through all is reincarnations. he became fierce deity in majora's mask. slayed giant monsters. learned the skyward strike, can shoot lasers out of his sword if he's full on health, learned to use LOADS of weapons. its not too far fetched to think that after he kills Ganon he would have plenty of time to master his abilities and become a one man army. also there have been wars in the legend of zelda timeline, this would most likely take place during one of them. and just look at the monsters in TP or at the end of skyward sword. there definitely using at least SOME strategy when they all charge at you. and i agree. you could tell some of the models were recycled from skyward sword. the king dodongo model looked good though."
