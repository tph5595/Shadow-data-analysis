10198,"""Oh no, we're getting TWO completely different Zelda U titles instead of just one! How HORRIBLE!!!"" It's not even being MADE by Nintendo, they just lent the license to the Warriors guys, meaning Zelda U hasn't been delayed or worsened ONE DAY by this announcement.

Also, Super Mario 3D World, The Wonderful 101, and Pikmin 3 are all ""hardcore"" and ""solid reasons to purchase a Wii U,"" and Monolith Soft's X looks great as far as upcoming projects are concerned. If Smash Bros. or Zelda are literally the only things that will get them to buy a Nintendo console, they aren't Nintendo fanboys OR hardcore gamers.

BTW not really arguing with you, just venting my feelings on all the random butthurt that this game is causing when it is VERY clearly a spin-off."
10670,"The problem is that it's not a new ""direction,"" it's a Dynasty Warriors game with Zelda paint. Completely different team at a completely different company. A spin-off. Anyone and everyone complaining about the ""new direction"" has no idea what they're talking about because this is NOT a main-series game, for Zelda OR Dynasty Warriors for that matter. The Pokemon analogy makes no sense because Hyrule Warriors is to Zelda what Mystery Dungeon or Conquest was to Pokemon, and I mean that literally since both MD and Conquest are other series with Pokemon paint."
10996,"It's a spin-off made by a different company. It affects ""Zelda U"" in no way whatsoever, just like the Mario platformers weren't affected by the Mario Karts (unless you count the reference in Super Mario 3D World).

If you don't like it, don't play it, and it won't affect you at all since you'll still get a real Zelda game later. If people think it looks cool, good for them, they'll enjoy this AND the real Zelda later."
11101,"This, like Crossbow Training, is a spin-off, so no worries; it's not pushing the main Zelda series anywhere, unless it actually ends up good and Nintendo gets inspired, in which case everyone wins."
62170,"Metroid is not a system seller; the entire series lifetime sales are less than Nintendogs. Skyward Sword didn't do great either, and basically everyone had a Wii, so that's sheer disinterest. MARIO is a system seller, along with Pokemon and the Wii series. Also, I constantly see people whining about Nintendo ONLY making Marios and Zeldas, so it gets annoying seeing people then say they aren't willing to try new things."
63633,"hehe, nice catch. While Land is good, it's probably not going to sell Wii U's."
64625,"&gt; Yeah, because many fans didn't want to play Zelda on a Wii remote with stupid, cartoony looking enemies. I personally loved the game once I gave it a try.

So what you're saying is that Nintendo makes good, different games, but people don't buy them because they want more of the same old stuff instead of trying something new? Wow, that's, like, what I already said.

&gt; Metroid is a potential system seller too if done right (which they won't ever do).

If Zero Mission, Super, Fusion, Prime, and Corruption aren't ""Metroid done right,"" I don't think you actually WANT a new Metroid game.

Nintendo's problem is that they're willing to do pretty much anything, but everyone hates them anyway. Nintendo fans beg and plead for Metroid, Star Fox, and F-Zero, but those are consistently mediocre in sales, meaning people aren't actually buying them when they come out. People beg Nintendo to revisit different franchises or make new IPs entirely instead of just more Mario, but when Nintendo makes the much anticipated Pikmin 3 and brand new IP The Wonderful 101, the only game people actually buy is the new Mario.

Even companies do it now; Nintendo thought they could get away with taking more time on their Wii U projects because 3rd parties were offering support, but at Wii U's launch EVERY SINGLE 3RD PARTY TITLE was over-priced (Scribblenauts, Mass Effect, Arkham City), missing content (Call of Duty, Assassin's Creed), delayed (Rayman), missing (Far Cry), or flat-out half-assed (Madden). 3rd parties blamed Nintendo for their jackassery, and they've consistently used it as an excuse to make their games worse or simply not make the games at all. Heck, EA and Unreal LITERALLY LIED TO THE PUBLIC about whether the Wii U was strong enough to run their new engines, as if they had some bizarre elementary school-level spite against Nintendo.

No one puts their money where their mouth is; your example of Skyward Sword fits that perfectly, as it was Nintendo's most-worked-on Zelda yet and finally delivered on the promise of good motion control, yet everyone took one look at it and said ""Screw it."" I mean, a cartoony Zelda couldn't possibly be good, right? Remember how the cartoony art style single-handedly ruined The Wind Waker?

Look, I'm not saying I DON'T want a new Metroid or Star Fox or what have you, but there are VERY REAL and, from a business perspective, GOOD reasons why Nintendo hasn't delivered on such requests. Fans don't know what they want, that has been proven time and time again. We'll get our classic series back, but in the mean time, Nintendo needs to make things that they know we will buy, because we have already told them with our past purchases what those are."
76067,"&gt; No, I'm saying Nintendo makes good games but screw themselves over by making them look childish and silly and trying to force their gimmicks on people.

Then the point still remains. Nintendo tried something new instead of rehashing Ocarina of Time again (which people criticized Twilight Princess for doing) and the newness scared people. You personally may have disliked the art style, but that doesn't make it bad, it just makes it different; many fans and critics actually liked the water color style and the Ghibli-esque creepy-yet-cute feel of the characters and enemies. Likewise, the motion controls were praised by many fans and critics, including even yourself when you gave it a chance, yet Nintendo was ""forcing gimmicks on people?"" People hate Nintendo for rehashing old stuff, and they hate Nintendo for trying new stuff; the Big N simply can't please its fans, which is why they just try to do their own thing. The ironic thing is that they are a nostalgia-heavy company; The Wind Waker and Majora's Mask, for example, were both hated on release by many fans, yet now they're everyone's favorites. Twilight Princess has also started to get more love lately, and now I wonder if next gen Skyward Sword will be the new game fans beg for an HD rerelease.

&gt; I guess I had a false conception of what the 3D metroid games were like.

The common misconception is that they are simply shooters due to the first-person perspective, but they are actually classic Metroid action-adventures through and through. I first played Prime not a day after finishing Super for the first time, and it was immediately clear that this is the same kind of game from a different perspective. I definitely recommend trying them out, especially since GameStop restocked on the Trilogy collection on Wii. ""Other M,"" on the other hand, is a mixed bag; it's visually more traditional, but the story is horrid and it's fairly linear. I wouldn't mind another in the same style, but with different writers and voice actors.

Won't argue that Nintendo causes many of its own problems; the refusal to take online seriously is completely insane. However, that doesn't change that outside forces are at work (Wii U could have easily run many AAA games that skipped it over the past year and a half, and the launch debacle is unforgivable), and speaking strictly on the subject of 1st party franchises, Nintendo's fickle fans are basically in constant war on the company, and there's nothing they can do about that."
