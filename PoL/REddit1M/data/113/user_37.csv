It felt kinda light on story, but I guess the whole game was that way. I feel like they could have added more. Would have been nice to see Link, Zelda, Impa, Purah, and Robbie all together discussing the future of Hyrule. And a montage of Zelda and Link traveling around Hyrule telling the 4 tribes and other towns that the calamity is over.

It was nice to get that scene with the ghosts though, reminded me of the ending of OoT with the sages."

The ending honestly felt kind of abrupt. Obviously I can fill in the gaps: after the ending Link and Zelda go around to the different tribes and towns and work towards rebuilding Hyrule. Still, it would have been nice to see a montage, and a scene with Purah, Robbie, Impa, Link, and Zelda all together again.

The ghosts were a nice touch though. Reminded me of the OoT ending with the sages. King Hyrule's relationship with his daughter is kinda tragic if you pay attention to the memories and read his diary in Hyrule castle.

After rewatching the memories, what do you think the message was that Zelda wanted to give to the Deku Tree to relay to Link?
