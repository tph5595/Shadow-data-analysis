1630,"Just completed a MasterSword% run. It was my second playthrough after getting all shrines, dungeons, and quests on my first one (as well as all level 4 armors). To be honest, the second playthrough was much more fun and I don't think you're supposed to 100% this game at all. The best part of the lower % playthrough was Ganon. He could actually kill me with my 13 hearts and level 0 armor, and fighting all the Blight Ganons before Calamity made it a marathon!

I still think the bosses are too much of pushovers and I really hope they're improved for hard mode. Out of the 6 main bosses, only Thunderblight and Calamity Ganon are good. The former is wicked fast and actually takes some skill to not be destroyed and the latter straight up requires you to get good at parrying and dodging. All the other bosses though... they look cool but I wish they could kill me. And Dark Beast Ganon is by far the worst Zelda boss of all time. Guy doesn't even attack.

Great game. I'll probably try speedrunning it, because I like it that much. At this point I dare say it's my 3rd favorite Zelda, toppling Twilight Princess but not A Link to the Past or Majora's Mask."

1. Teleport to the stable south of the canyon separating Hebra and Central Hyrule (the one that has the forgotten temple) and climb the cliff with the Luminous Talus. Dinraal passes by at midnight.

2. Teleport to Horon Lagoon (north of Mount Lanayru). Use Cryonis to go south and wait on the water close to the mountain. Naydra passes by around 2-3, seems to vary.

3. Teleport to the stable by Lake Floria and wait on the bridge. Farosh passes by at 5."

You fight these huge, hulking cyborg demons that look like they could just crush you with their size, but they don't even try anything like that. They do these big flashy attacks but they're blocked by a pot lid. Calamity Ganon has like 9 limbs and he could probably just walk on Link to kill him, but nope, he uses exactly one limb at a time. And he retreats up on the wall. It's... really strange because his size should make him the aggressor in this fight with you struggling to find your footing. The Demise fight in Skyward Sword was awesome, because it really felt like you were fighting a bigger swordsman who took full advantage of that size. Idk, I have my hopes up for hard mode."

112583,"There's a cliff north of Death Mountain that seems to lead to whatever is north of Hyrule. If you try walking on it it tells you that ""you can't go any further"" with no excuse. I think that's the only boundary that doesn't have a wall or canyon in the way and is a straight up invisible wall."
148968,Have you found all the towers yet? There are 15 of them and you can spot more shrines than you might expect from them.
