83964,"I was kinda the same as after I got the paraglider the first thing I do is go the complete opposite way of Kakiriko village, see a bunch of Lizalfos and got my ass completely kicked, but I struggle all the way through them cause I see something shiny they guard, turn out it was a flame greatsword, which make making fire much much easier from that point. The only spoiler I allow myself to have before playing the game was whether Master Sword still exist and how to get it, so I know 13 hearts is needed and I put all my spirit orbs into it first. I did manage to get very close to Gerudo, but I dont have clothes to stand the heat at that time so I turn back.

After a while I finally decided to go to Kakiriko village, and then Hateno, I finish all the power up ruin right away and when I was just wondering around I accidentally stump upon a Zora's girl saying the prince of Zora want to meet, so I got curious and follow her, end up in Zora first. After Zora I already got close to 13 hearts, so I make my way to Lost Forest with Hetsu's pointer, and get the Master Sword first, then since I was wandering around there I got to Rito next. By this point I already found alot of stable and get a bunch of beautiful horses so I travel by land more, Gerudo is next since I have clothes for the heat now, and as I make my way to Goron I completely tank through the heat, just eating meal after meal while got burned as I move to Goron town, and immediately spend all my money on the armor there.

Fighting Ganon was also fun, I keep to myself the mind set of ""this is my home, I will not sneak around and go directly through the front door"" and end up exploring all the castle, refused to move ahead while I've not clear the previous things. so I end up with lots of ancient part and create the set after the game end"
