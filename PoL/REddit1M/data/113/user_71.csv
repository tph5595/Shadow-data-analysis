203044,"I beat the game 95 hours in the other day! Despite complaints I heard I really enjoyed the game, and I'm still continuing my adventure to explore the rest of the map.

My only problem though is that I had to fight ganon twice. :( I got the last memory at the castle, missed the shrine at the docks, then after beating ganon I found the secret 13th memory and had to go all the way back through. Unless I happened to overlook it telling me to come back before defeating Ganon, or that I played so much that I forgot, I'm upset for ruining the immersion for myself and had to fight him twice to get the correct ending &gt;\\&lt;"
