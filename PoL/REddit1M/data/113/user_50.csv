109947,"I started out putting all my spirit orbs into hearts, because during the Great Plateau part, having three hearts held me back more than having one wheel of stamina. When I heard about needing 13 hearts for the Master Sword, that just confirmed my decision to keep focusing on hearts. Once I got the Master Sword, I started putting every upgrade into stamina until I got all three wheels and climbing went from ""not bad, even the hard stuff is manageable with cooking"" to ""completely effortless.""

Plotwise, I mostly stayed on the rails up through Hateno, after which I spent a lot of time dawdling around the Hateno/Kakariko/Dueling Peaks area doing side quests. After I'd done most of what I could do, I took a brief detour south to explore the Lake Hylia/Faron regions. Most memorable encounter from that time is fighting an Electric Wizzrobe at the base of Faron Tower right before a Blood Moon brought it back, barely surviving, and then realizing I didn't have enough stamina to climb to the top of the tower and had no stamina-restoring items. At around that part, I headed back north and started the Zora quest line, but bailed after getting the Zora shirt to explore the Gerudo Desert. I started the Gerudo quest while I was down there, but trailed off doing Gerudo Town side quests instead of looking for the Yiga clan hideout. I climbed the Highlands tower while I was in the area but didn't do anything else in the Gerudo Highlands. Around this time, I started exploring the area between the Plateau and Dueling Peaks, which I had rushed through the first time and had missed a lot of stuff. I found Hestu again at one of the stables, upgraded the crap out of my inventory and decided to follow him to the Lost Woods after he left the stable, since I had ~12 hearts at that point. I did some of the shrine quests in the Lost Woods and also Typhlo Ruins, which gave me the last Spirit Orb I needed for my 13th heart.

I got the Master Sword. At this point in the game, I have not yet set foot inside a dungeon.

Afterwards, I head down to Ridgeland, briefly venture into Hyrule Field to get the tower in that area, and cross Tabantha Bridge into the Rito area. I also find the Great Fairy and start paying more attention to clothing upgrades. I start the Rito quest, but bail before I actually go to meet the guy at the Flying Range. Because I had trouble with Guardians near the Hyrule Field tower, I decide now's as good a time as any to head to Akkala and get the Ancient Arrows. I start the Tarrey Town quest on my way up to the lab and since the first guy Hudson wants to recruit is a Goron, I head to Death Mountain after lighting Robbie's furnace. I start the Goron quest, but, predictably, I bail before I go to the Abandoned Northern Mines. I did find the Goron that Hudson wanted and end up completing the Tarrey Town side quest. At this point, the only region I haven't mapped is Hebra, so I climb that tower and explore the region after buying the cold weather clothing from Rito Village (I also do the Shrine of Wisdom quest and start exploring the Gerudo Highlands properly).

This is the point where I reach the first dungeon in my playthrough. I started the quests for all four, so I could have gone with any of them, but I decided to go with the Rito dungeon for mostly arbitrary reasons, because I'd ended my last playthrough fairly close to their village and figured I might as well. It didn't exactly scratch the itch I'd been having for a real involved Zelda dungeon, but it had some really interesting things going on nonetheless.

I finished up the Zora quest pretty soon after. I'd spent a long time dreading Lynels, but since I put the plot off for so long, the one guarding the shock arrows right before the dungeon was pretty easy to handle. The Zora dungeon was good, but also shorter than I would've liked.

The other day I ducked into Hyrule Castle from a side entrance to follow up on some side quests from Riverside stable, got some neat weapons, and that's where my route has taken me so far."
