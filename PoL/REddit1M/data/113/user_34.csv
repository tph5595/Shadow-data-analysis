53683,"The sun rises and sets VERY often in Hyrule Castle. It's never explicitly mentioned but it seems Zelda's sealing magic has created a time bubble. It makes sense that no one else would know this without visiting the castle themselves. It also explains how Zelda's had the endurance to fight for so long. If a day passes in a minute, 100 years is a much shorter amount of time.

I thought it was a really cool touch."
96757,"lol I definitely had an ""oh no!"" moment watching that sun go up and down. On my playthrough I doubt i was in there for more than a month of ""real"" time, at least!

And to be clear, Zelda was still in there for almost a month on her own time scale, so it was all still very impressive and magical."
