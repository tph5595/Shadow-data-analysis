11878,"Okay so there are birds and lizards in universe but where did the Sheikah get the ideas for an Elephant and a Camel?!

Maybe the the new Sheikah (assuming the 10,000 years ago was at the end of the current timelines) came from a different continent where they had elephants and camels and that's where those designs come from. Sequel would send Link and Zelda to this new continent which would keep the tower/shrine mechanic intact story wise. Also would help explain the absence of Sheikah for much of the timeline they left Hyrule for Newrule or whatever before coming back.

Okay I got carried away but the camel and elephant annoy me."
16280,But they're not seen anywhere except the two divine beasts. Not in drawings or dialogue at least in the English version. We have drawings and descriptions of dragons everywhere which is why we know what they look like. Naboris and Ruta and images of them are the only camel and elephant in the entire Zelda canon! I mean it doesn't break immersion or anything obviously but to me it sticks out.
16493,What part of the game is that?
18392,Thanks! Now go find me camels haha
