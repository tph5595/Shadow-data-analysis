51689,"Just popping in to say: WHOO HOO 100 SHRINES!

I was stuck at 98 for a while, but decided to start combing every village and stable for any shrine quests I missed, and instantly found two in Rito Village. These spirit orbs let me max out my stamina wheel. After my city-sweep, I have to head to Gerudo Town for my last divine beast arc, and then once that's done I'll clean up any remaining shrines and...uh...maybe work on getting another six or seven hundred Korok seeds...^(or not...)"
