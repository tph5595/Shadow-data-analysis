8853,"&gt;And Dark Beast Ganon is by far the worst Zelda boss of all time. 

As a final boss for sure idk what they were thinking, but as an overall boss no Zelda boss remains at pathetic as the Angler fish from Link's awakening"
9159,"I think their plan to contain him using ancient sheikah tech backfired as he was able to gain control of all divine beasts by using the tech in hyrule castle as a conduit. 

In that time I think he began to integrate ancient weapons into his body to become a much more modern threat to Hyrule. Kind of like how the Metroid Prime from the first Prime game was originally a highly mutated Metroid, it became even more deadly when it began to steal Space pirate weaponry and integrate it into its body"
22056,Yeah the tower thing is a good point. They were trying to recreate what happened in legend 10K years ago but tried to fight Ganon with just bigger weapons rather than taking the steps to properly defend themselves
22234,"The Master Sword is pretty good against Guardians who are calamity enemies so I could imagine him just dismembering them by the legs one by one and just stabbing them through the eye for story's sake. 

Perhaps he lost a lot of his original strength when he was resurrected as he was very close to dying (I like to think of it like in the Princess Bride the main character was considered to be mostly dead but not completely). I mean shit, in that one memory he took out an entire army of Lynels, Bokoblins, and etc by himself"
22354,"Yo honestly I was so pissed off at how all the divine beasts combined took away 1/2 his health, that made the fight way too easy. I would have preferred their massive laser finish to be in the latter fight against Dark Beast Ganon who's well exposed to being directly fired upon"
23291,Maybe the Master Sword was stronger back then? He relied on it almost exclusively and it's millenia after its appearance in other possible games so possibly the combination of combination of age and ancient weapons led to the master sword being a shell of its formal self where it can decay and truly needs an evil force to willingly bring it back to par
