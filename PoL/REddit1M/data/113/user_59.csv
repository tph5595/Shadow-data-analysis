145666,I refused to kill Ganon wearing anything other than the Wild set
145922,Getting Link's official green tunic set for BotW (Wild set) and killing Ganon for the first time while wearing it was overly satisfying.

190891,The only way it should be done! Otherwise Ganon won't recognize you as the same hero that has just stopped his plans... again.
248728,"Eh, I just 1-starred it and went in. Having a ton of hearts and enough food to ensure I'd never die, I would've beaten Ganon while naked pretty easily had I wanted to. Wearing the classic greens were too important to me"
1225424,I just wanted to make sure that fucker knew exactly who I was!
