16234,Well said. The dark beast Ganon was definitely the treat and grand spectactle you get to experience after. The spider Ganon WAS the finale. I don't think the dark beast fight was designed to be hard at all. It was meant for you to gaze at the true force of nature Ganon looks like. All the difficulty was packed into the first phase of Ganon 
23437,I kind of was too. I wish the divine beasts were implemented differently instead of taking away health.
