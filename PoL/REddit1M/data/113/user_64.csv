179311,"I have been regularly keeping up on this sub since I got the game about a month ago however not this specific thread. Couldn't find the information I was looking for so I'm gonna ask here, hopefully for the first time.


I kinda rushed through my first play through so I have started a 2nd.  My first time through I visited all the memory sites before I fought Calamity Ganon and apparently this unlocks ""more"" of an ending.  So...after beating CG, the game goes through it's specific ending then the credits roll.  After the credits Link and Zelda are in a field overlooking Hyrule Castle.  She looks at the Shiekah Slate and says ""looks like there is something wrong with the Divine Beast at Zora's Domain"".  What does this mean?


I guess I was under the impression that after you beat Ganon, Zelda ""wakes up"" and the final cut scene is current rather than a memory.  Is this correct or did I miss a whole bunch? "
