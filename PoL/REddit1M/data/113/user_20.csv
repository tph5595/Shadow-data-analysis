In my preference, I really want a game without it, or that hardmode does not include it.

There are way too many places I have been to, but not seen, or just missed, or didn't see the cool shit as if I had come by the road. Just because I was just gliding through the world because its quicker. 

I want to do the same experience as this, but only on foot or horseback or the like. "
