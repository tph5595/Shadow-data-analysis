78355,"I finished the game yesterday and I know how many do not like the Soundtrack but I really really love the melodies in this one, first hyrule castle, then the epic Ganon fight and then the beast Ganon fight. I especially like the beast Ganon fights music as you can hear the games main theme representing Zelda and the piano in the background representing Ganon going wild as he fights for his last resort, really great stuff. 
This will not be the favorite soundtrack for most people in the franchise but for me it is because of these usages of dissonances, themes and such, so it may not be always foot tapping music but much more interesting and complex one. I very look forward to the release of the full soundtrack!"
