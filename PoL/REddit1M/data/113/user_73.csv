219405,"At first, I wasn't overly impressed with the soundtrack -- there were a lot of small piano riffs in the beginning of the game, which was cool. But throughout gameplay, the riffs gave way to orchestrated pieces. That's when I fell in love with it. 

It's an incredible soundtrack, IMHO. It pulls in melodies from so many previous games, while also using new ones."
219662,"Agreed with the ""I love you"" bit from Zelda. She was leaving to confront Ganon after dropping off the Master Sword. Who knew if she would survive? Deku Tree telling her to tell Link herself was basically saying, ""find a way to survive"".

I also get the feeling that many of the characters didn't think Link would sleep for as long as he did. "
220122,"With all 4 guardians and their powers, Ganon was pretty easy. I had a harder time getting into Vah Ruta and fighting Waterblight Ganon. I also only had 5 hearts back then, so there's that. I legit ran out of bows and arrows, and defeated him by throwing a torch at him."
220403,"As a side note, the ""Save Zelda"" trope did annoy me a bit in this game. I get it, it's part of the Zelda franchise, and I recognize that certain Zeldas have taken on fighting roles, too.

But when the King was begging Link to save Zelda, I thought, ""Shouldn't you be begging him to save your kingdom? To save the people of the land now? To free the land from Ganon?"" Especially since we didn't know if Zelda was alive or dead at this point. "
220512,"Yeah, I think this is the most plausible, as well. I mean, Link kept his boyish good looks after ""resting"" for 100 years. So, Zelda also staying young in a cocoon makes sense. Right?"
