7331,"What a cool ending but my maxed up Tunic of the Wild armor makes everything so easy now. 

That story is something to be desired. So if I'm getting this right, Ganon was taking over everything 100 years ago, including the Guardians leaving Hyrule in ruins. Link is pwned, goes into hiding of sorts. What happens to Zelda? She is still alive after all that time? The story was the worst part of the game I think. Unless I'm missing something. "
9078,Whaaaa? So she's still young and such because she's been fighting him... in the castle? Was she preserved by Ganon? Weird.
9107,This explanation is a little better. I guess I didn't get that from the cut scenes.

15237,Must have missed that part.
