108552,Yeah I was a bit disappointed that the soundtrack that comes with the Special Edition isn't the full soundtrack.
108687,"Thought you were talking about the Rito kite shield and was really confused for a second there.

I recently finished 120 shrines and have been considering starting a new run using the pro HUD and no fast travel."
108811,"Yeah I was a little disappointed at that. Would have been better if there were just strong winds all around that you could not pass, or something physical to at least give the illusion that the world wasn't bounded by imaginary lines."
110869,"Yeah. Many of them give you some kind of distinct landmarks, but that one absolutely doesn't.

Only found out after looking at a guide that the painter from Kakariko will appear in various stables and offer help finding the memories. I had never talked to him once :/

I'm glad I ended up checking a guide for the last couple shrines though, since one is hidden where your sensor can't see it, and doesn't have an associated quest. Probably never would have found it."
113982,Similar thing on the western edge of the Gerudo Highlands. There's a narrow plateau running north and south that you can't actually get up on top of.
170919,If I'm going to the colosseum yeah I'll fight the Lynel. Just saying it's not necessary. 
170987,I'm pretty sure you can pull out a shield while falling. I haven't tried in combat and doubt it would be useful. 
191521,Fun story: I went to all 120 shrines before I found every stable. Oops.
217216,Serenne Stable is slightly further away...
