37008,"My first time through the game I always climbed to the closest high peak, found a shrine to save, and glided in the direction I wanted to go. It was laborious and a little tedious at times.

(I then accidentally erased my save game after 100 shrines and 150 korok seeds because I didn't realize creating a new game erased my old game. Only 1 save file?! Wtf Nintendo?)

Now that I started over, I'm horsing my way through all the trails. It's a much more scenic and organic way to explore Hyrule, and there's way more people to talk to. Everything seems to make more sense now that I'm getting more info from the NPCs."
