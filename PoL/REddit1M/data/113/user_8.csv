8176,"Yeah the story wasn't the best (especially the ending IMO) but I still liked it. What you missed is that Zelda's been fighting Ganon for the 100 years, which is presumabely how she's still alive as well. "
9307,"It's never actually explained so that's the best guess yeah. That she didn't take a physical form during those 100 years (given that she's shown popping out of Ganon after you defeat it that's more or less credible) and as such didn't age.

But really it's never actually explained so the best thing you can do is make up an explanation like that."
15905,I might be forgetting something but I don't know what you're referring. The closest thing I can see is in SS where [Zelda seals herself in the past](/spoiler) but that's more time travel shenanigans than anything else
16293,"He had the MS so he must somehow have acquired 13 hearts tho.

Also he fights guardians without a shield or a bow, somehow."
16848,"Yeah but people are surprised at the fact that Zelda didn't age, not that you have to save her, so I kinda don't see your point."
22501,Yeah not denying 100 years ago Link was damn good. Those are silver lynels in memory 8 too IIRC. What I was alluding too is the fact that while your technique would work against a guardian it wouldn't against the onslaught he faces in memory 17 yet he still took out quite a lot of them.
23717,Maybe ? That would make sense. It:s the first time we've seen the MS in such bad shape too which concurs with your theory. But I guess we'll never know for sure.
99539,"Yeah, til the next game.

More seriously tho she also says in the true ending the threat of Ganon is ""gone for now"" implying it might not be for good.

Also I read an interesting comment today speculating that maybe when she said that she meant he was forgoing being ressurected in his physical form (which seems to be what he's doing with the face on Calamity Ganon ? Obviously it's really incomplete tho) and that's why Dark Beast Ganon is a pure being of malice, which would explains the discrepancy between what she says in the true ending and what she says before the Dark Beast Ganon fight.

101192,"You're right, a montage during the credits showing various characters rebuilding Hyrule would have been neat. Kinda like the credits in the Ace Attorney (and probably a lot of others) series, where you have every somewhat important character with a line or two giving closure on what they're up to.

As to what Zelda wanted to say, I think it's pretty obvious she wanted to say that she loves Link. I honestly don't see anything else that would fit with the context of the cutscene, either. And actually the English dub's probably the most subtle about it, though I don't remember the exact words. But in the French dub the Deku Tree says ""such a message should be delivered personally"", and in the Latino (is that the name? The other Spanish one that's not the European Spanish. It's the best dub **by far** btw) he just doesn't even bother with subtlety and says something like ""matters of the heart should be discussed personally"", so taking that into account it's kinda hard to think the opposite."
145075,"If you finish all main quests you get an additional scene after the ""the end"". 

I will have to listen again but I heard pretty much everywhere that she says that."
160299,"It's just a reminder of the spoiler policy on this sub, it doesn't apply to this thread."
160486,"Beat all his quests and his daughters's quest (Warbler's nest I think is the name ?)

He will appear at Rito village and ask you to go meet him at night, as during the day he watches over his daughters. 

There, he'll (spoilers obviously) [tell you that](http://m.imgur.com/a/B6Xoq)"
161370,"For me it was the 8th, the one near Goron village. Took me a few hours because I immediately ruled out the correct place because there was a tower obstructing the view, and I didn't consider the tower wasn't there 100 years ago until like 3 hours after I began searching. 

It was my last one, then I immediately went to the 17th memory which was super easy. The payoff was soooooo worth it. By this point between the memories, the cutscenes and the january trailer which showed a key part of the scene I pretty much knew how it would go down (well - the first part at least),but actually seeing it is different, you know ?"
184927,"You're correct. There's not much to the cutscene, really, and, if while there might be something wrong with Ruta, there's no postgame so we'll never know I guess. Still a nice cutscene."
186753,Yep.
231724,And of course their quest was a shrine quest where you discover a shrine using a song.
