15035,"I'm a road-follower until I am sure I have all of the ""tutorial"" information.  Then I did Zora and Rito, then tried to find all of the villages/stables (Zora got a detour to find villages because of the Lynel, and I stumbled on Laurelin who happens to have shock arrows).  Then I did a string of shrines in a row that I had just activated the travel but not completed because I didn't want to.  Then armor upgrades, then Rudania, then Naboris, then the random exploring for the rest of the shrines, more armor upgrades, then Ganon at like 150h played."
