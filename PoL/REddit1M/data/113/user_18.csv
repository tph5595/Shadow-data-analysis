20546,"I went Zora, Goron, Rito, Gerudo, both in discovery and completion. I found one of the Zoras looking for Hylians by accident and just followed the path he pointed to out of habit(you know, a stranger asks you for a favor and you do it because apparently the game progresses that way).

Personally, I feel the Zora Domain and Ruta were a good choice for the first dungeon (and boss) because not only did the Zora have a pretty fleshed out ""quest line"" what with Sidon guiding you along and Link facing hatred from the old Zora. The dungeon itself was rather engaging. I *know* it was short, but I spent quite a while experimenting with the trunk positions. The section of actually boarding Ruta was amazing. Very fun, and *holy shit, I get to ride on a Zora!*

The whole section made me want more. Whereas the Rito were kinda disappointing as a whole(and I was looking forward to getting in contact with them too). The Gerudo and the Gorons were fun as well, but neither of them had a deeper impact, as none of them actually grow old enough to personally know Link unlike the Zora.

From a difficulty standpoint, I'd say Rito&gt;Gorons&gt;Zora&gt;Gerudo. 

The Rito had barely anything in terms of difficulty. Yes, getting through Hebra mountains can be a challenge, but neither getting into the beast nor solving the puzzles in there or the boss were particularly challenging. The boss (and the section in general) did a good job of teaching you Arrow Time though.

The Gorons were challenging in that actually getting there could prove to be quite a feat because of the heat, and the ""stealth"" section with Yunobo was pretty crazy imo(and I even had 4 Ancient arrows from random quests to cheese part of it). The boss however was pretty easy and less engaging than either of the others, provided you knew how to disable the heat aura.

The Zoras were rather challenging to get to, with no way to climb the cliffs and plenty of shock arrow users on the way. The boss and Ruta were by far the most engaging with the aim and shoot mechanics of both Arrow Time and Cryonis.

The Gerudo, my final stop, were worthy of a final story portion imo: A decently challenging stealth section that also finally reveals the base of all the mysterious bandits I met on my journey. A dungeon that, finally, had me grind my gears again. Like with Ruta, I had to do quite a lot of trial and error here and felt legitimately invested in the dungeon(Rudania and Medoh were rather ""go with the flow-y"").

And finally, a teeth-clenchingly hard boss. To be honest, I'm not sure how I'd have beaten Thunderblight Ganon without the Master Sword. His fast movements were too quick for me to flurry rush through, so in the end I had to go full force ahead, no shield, just the MS, as the MS couldn't be knocked away by lightning. Maybe I cheesed him a bit by relying on that tidbit about MS, but it was still an engaging boss fight.

I have yet to beat Calamity Ganon itself(can't play during the week), but that'll be a while away anyways, as I still want to explore more and most importantly collect all the memories before the grand final fight."
