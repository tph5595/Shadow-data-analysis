189916,"That was the goal I had set for myself.  If I was going to storm the castle, I was doing in in the green tunic I always wore when I found myself staring Ganon in the face."
189977,"Yeah I was bummed when I found an invisible wall in the desert, at least give me a sandstorm respawn like they did with the lost woods.  "
190228,I just started hitting the stables when I realized he was popping up at them giving hints.

192535,"Ores and Gems....

Am I missing anything?  I was pretty nervous about selling them, and I've played through the whole game and never saw any use besides the Gerudo shop.  Are they basically Rupee bombs or what?"
192665,I think its a Fallen Link/Fallen Ganon Convergence.  It's established in the game that both have been defeated and resurfaced.  It brings all the split timelines full circle.

Its obviously in the forest, so when you're looking for it, you're most likely going to head to Great Hyrule forest and stumble on it.  I thought it was a very smart way to bring back that feeling of exploring and stumbling on something huge like that."
