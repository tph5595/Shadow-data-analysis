98016,"I keep hearing people (especially on Youtube) saying ""there is LITERALLY no place you cannot go. If you can see it, you can go there""

Well, no. There are huge land masses you can see but can't get to. In fact in the South there is even a place on the main land mass where you'll start to climb and you will get an onscreen message ""you cannot go any further""

This isn't a criticism of the game. I just don't get why people keep repeating this."

Curious how much the naked run moves the needle"
128790,What's the kite?
128928,The kite shield says it's for aerial combat. Is this functional? I mean how do you use it while in the air?
