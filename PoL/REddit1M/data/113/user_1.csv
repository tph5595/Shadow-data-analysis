1249,"Who has the best method of farming Dragon parts? What's your fastest run for either a single dragon, or all three dragons at once? 

For single dragon, I've found that there's a jutting rock just west of the colossus bones for the fire dragon. The jutting rock provides cover for rain, and he drops his piece almost straight down from this position, and comes up just after the 'sleep til morning' option."
