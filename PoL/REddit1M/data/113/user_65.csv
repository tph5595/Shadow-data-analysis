182457,"I just ""beat"" the game last night. I had just finished the Vah Medoh dungeon, and I was planning on going to the last dungeon I needed to complete, Vah Rudania. (I think that's the name) Of course, I got really sidetracked, and eventually decided to visit Hyrule Castle. It was my second time going there, the first time being when I hadn't beaten any of the Divine Beasts yet. Since I had a lot better gear than I had then, I decided to try and fight the final boss, just for shit's and giggles. It was... Easy. Honestly, I have never fought an easier final boss in any Zelda game. I didn't even have good gear, yet I was easily able to beat Ganon just by utilizing the Champions' abilities correctly. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the hell out of it, but I felt that the final boss was very disappointing."
