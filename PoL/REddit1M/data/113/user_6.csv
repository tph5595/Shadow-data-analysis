7227,"&gt;  And Dark Beast Ganon is by far the worst Zelda boss of all time

i thought my game was glitched, this easiness took away all the apic of the battle, that boar even tried to attack me"
7292,"&gt; I'm sad because I have not idea what to do with myself

same here, I am playing Binding of Isaac until my return to complete all the shrines"
7900,why do you think that calamity ganon has that guardian like form? do you think that Yiga tried to revive him 100 years before the present time and because that he controlled all the sheikah tech and divine beasts?
8226,"sadly I have played the witcher 2 and 3 already, I think I am going to dark soul 3"
13687,I like your theory
16326,"haha, you must be playing around in front of him he only attack to the front, i was thinking that he was trying to destroy hyrule or something and not trying to kill me"
16775,"yeah it feels by an epilogue but they took away the magic, normally the last part is more epic than the one that came before, here was epic but too easy that you don't feel the pleasure when you beat it like other zeldas, I know it was not planned to be difficult and that is the shame also i did not feel spider ganon more dificult than a silver lynel but anyway was a better experience to fithg"
16825,when did they say that? I really need to make a 2ds playthorught haha
17452,"plateuo - hyrule castle- kakarico -hestu- hateno -kakrico - hateno - eventide island - south beach - did not see lurelin and past away-climb the the twin peak - kakarico sidequests- somebody in lanayrutold me that he hear somebody scream in the north - zora tower - talk to sidon - love sidon theme- not gooing to zora domain haha- wander away directly to find the korok forest...in faron- not found any korok forest there but found a dragon- giant horse quest- tried to return to hyrule castle- found hestu again- realized that korok forest is in the north- found master sword- died pulling it- did all korok quest- zora quest - wandering for a week in akkala and faron - goron quest- wandering for a week - gerudo desert-yiga hideout - wandering gerudo highland - then tabahanta then hebra - gerudo quest - wandering hebra - rito quest(total dissapointing)- killed ganon-  find my last memory - find hateno fort memory - killed ganon again - wandering and doing shrine
that was my month of botw, a lot of fun I had"
17779,"that is why is ended injured he never learned how to parry or shoot in the eye... “I used to be  guardian, then I took an arrow in the eye.”"
17879,what do did you expect? an infinite overwold created procedurally? or that developer don't show that lands to make it feels real and show you a black barrier
18270,"I had silver lynels with only 2 divine beast because I was farming it, if you kill a lot of enemies they are going to get better to the next blood moon, aslo if you beat the game they improve by theirself. I was very expert parrying laser and dodging and the final battle was very easy to me but it is true, haha my litltle sister can not parry or dodge and she is going to die a lot with calamity ganon"
19181,Zelda is my fav saga and botw my fav game of all time but i also enjoy a lot dark soul. I only states that the final dark beast could be more hard a little more but it was easiest than a hinox. I am waiting that hard mode with a lot of expectations
20622,"I hate dlc too but i like expansion is not the same, the december one is more like a expsnsion but the summer one feels like a dlc so I bought day one waiting for the winter"
29723,"Ok lets fit it, you can  literally go anywhere you can put a marker haha"
50078,"I loved the original ds2 but i never played the scholar of the first sin edition, that game remembered me a lot majoras mask and i don't know why"
51390,Does it? Is it different? Not only a new final boss? Maybe it worths a try
81424,"I will replay DS2 in the future, that is for sure so to this time I will give a try of the scholar, the bad thing is that i can not export my save from ds2 to play scholar in new game+"
173251,"yeah, I always visit coliseum to get loot, it level up with your progress, it is said in the official guides in the secret section, this game is amazing"
173373,"I was expected that Ganon talk some words but It seems it is not transient anymore, it is right now like an earthquake or a tsunami. I was a little disappointed but the fight was amazing "
