186994,"Let's take a poll: Which Timeline do you think this is in?

My opinion is that it's in the Adult timeline. I think we can rule out the Child timeline as the sages weren't significant figures in that timeline. And the beasts are named after them so they had to be significant. Also the Tablet that talks about Ruto talks about her sealing Ganon. 

I don't think we can rule out the downfall timeline, but I haven't read the Historia so I'm hazy on the influence of the sages in that timeline. "
