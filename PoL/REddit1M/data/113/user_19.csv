21839,"&gt; And Dark Beast Ganon is by far the worst Zelda boss of all time. Guy doesn't even attack.

I would pay for a DLC that makes Dark Beast Ganon a decent final boss. I could imagine it trying to run you over, moving crazy fast and actually shooting at you. But then it would slow down a little bit when Zelda uses her powers, and that would be your chance to shoot him.

I mean, I understand that this fight was supposed to be more cinematic, and it was cool. But it could be cooler."
