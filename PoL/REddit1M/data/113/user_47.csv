Rules: you cannot put on any clothes ever, except Gerudo Town. "

The other 10%, hot meals and elixirs. "

My first regular run started as a 7 but ended as a 3, as I got familiar with the mechanics, acquired better armor, and filled up my stamina and hearts. 

Having just completed my first divine beast on this run (Vah Medoh), so far I'd say it's a 6. We'll see how it goes. 

I'm planning on doing Medoh, Darunia, Ruta, and Naboris in that order. So far I have put all my upgrades into stamina, and plan on maxing stamina before I do any hearts. But I do keep a full stock of fairies on me at all times. "
