201227,"I never played Wind Waker, so I'll probably give that a go.  As a Kid I *hated* how gimmicky Majora's Mask felt, but I'll give that a go as an adult now.  I'll probably get OoT and play through that again for nastalgia, and then maybe even see if I can't get Spirit Tracks on the Virtual Console. 

Hell, I might actualy play ALttP again.  I've only beaten that game ~15 times.  I mght actually try and get all the gadgets etc without any help.  I think its probably been 10 years since the last time I played that game.  "
