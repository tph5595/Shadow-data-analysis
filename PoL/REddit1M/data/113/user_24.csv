40752,"I just defeated Gannon. I have all the memories. [spoiler].... Zelda asked me if I really remembered her. And then credits rolled. Wtf. Is that the end? Is there another ""real"" ending? I'm watching the credits right now... ETA: there is a scene after ""The End"" when Zelda makes a comment about the sword. Is that the ""true ending""?[/spoiler]"
