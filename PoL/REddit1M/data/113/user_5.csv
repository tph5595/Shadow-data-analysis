6847,"So what sort of routes though the game did people take?

Mine was.. odd. I was throwing all of my Spirit Orbs into Stamina until it capped, so I quickly embraced a ""Fair fights are for suckers"" mindset. So was mostly fleeing and climbing and paragliding and setting fires. (I did not learn about bombs+paraglide until way late)

Anyway, with all that Stamina, the game quickly became, ""OOOH! How far could I fly if I climbed THAT?"" ""Oh! WAIT! What is over THERE?""

Example:
-Takes the wrong turn and ends up in Hateno Village.

-Got the hint about Mount Lanaryu, but ended up in Karakiro instead.

-Spotted Zora tower, told to go meet Prince Fanfic.

-Distracted by a ridgeline to the southwest, when returning to Purah, so don't actually complete Zora's Domain. Oops.

-Ends up in Gerudo. Dressed like a PRETTY PRETTY PRINCESS and killed WHALE. AWESOME. But gets distracted again before I could help Chief ""Vaguely amused by my BS"". Oops. Now I'm in a Rainforest.

Sense a theme? Yeah. My Link just could not focus on anything. It was awesome. I didn't even find other stables until a mid-game effort to explore the actual roads, etc without climbing.

My discovery of the Beasts was: Zora, Gerudo, Goron, Rito but my actual completion was: Zora, Gerudo, Rito, Goron.

8185,I'm going to go back and 100% shrines and seeds without a guide. Okay MAYBE a guide if I'm down to like a handful of them left. But that's after a long break. I deliberately loaned the game to a friend so I can step away. The game was taking over ALL of my free time.
14160,"I think I'm lucky in that I grasped the trick to the Thunderblight fight pretty early. I had more trouble with Waterblight Ganon because I didn't think about the Cryo rune as much as I should have.  So, Thunderblight was a series of me running around screaming and flailing with the Magnet rune. it was Hilarious, considering I only had 4 or 5 actual hearts. And I didn't have much in the way of temp heart food. Oh! And Mipha's grace was on recharge, because I R DUM.

P.S. I would have had SO MUCH FUN with Revali's gale so early in the game. Instead it was Mipha's grace saving my butt alot. Thank you Fish Waifu Princess!"
14504,Wow. Um. He zapped me pretty hard and set me on fire a few times. I'm terrible at horse archery! LOL.
14745,"Purah mentions that they never found any of the towers until one was revealed during the earthquakes during the calamity. So, I expect the towers were a literal network and firewall that would have prevented Ganon's l33t haxxor skillz. Also, the shrines didn't activate until the tower re-established the network. So no shrines = No heart/stamina powerups for Link. Dude was trying an Any% 3 heart 0 stamina speedrun."
14899,I want to start using the world FIGURATIVELY like people (including myself) use the word LITERALLY.
24362,"I used the magnet rune to fling the spears into the air, so he was shocking himself."
24819,"His AI might have gotten stuck in a loop. In my fight, getting zapped did put him into aggro-stabby mode, but then he went back into lightning mode after a bit. And I just ran and ran. Um, actually ""I just ran and ran"" explains what I did with most of my encounters in the game, lol."
111308,"I must be the minority in that I didn't bother with the Master Sword until after the beasts. And by that point, I had over 13 hearts already."
114060,I KNOW RIGHT? Literally the same thing happened to me.
