61099,"I really think the fact that they went out of their way to basically name drop Twilight Princess in the middle of a cutscene is about as explicit as it gets when it comes to placement in the timeline. My interpretation of that scene is that it is basically there for the sole purpose of placing it in the time line. The Geography of hyrule changes immensely from game to game if my memory of other games is correct, and I would caulk that up to each teams creative freedom so that they don't feel like they have to just re use the same map. But this is a really cool map. Wasn't there an interview somewhere where they said they took inspiration for the Geography from several previous games? Or am I thinking of a different game? "
