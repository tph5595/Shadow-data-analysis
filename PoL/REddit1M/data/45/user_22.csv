43133,"are those sages stated to be anything anywhere? If not, a few different angles:

those ARE the sages from OOT, that's just what they look like now (and this would mean Ruto was destroyed by Ganondorf)

those are new sages because the oot sages already passed on (and if you want to dive deeper, the water sage Ganondorf destroyed was Medli)

the oot sages WERE sages but weren't needed on the same level as they were in the adult timeline during the relative peace of their lifetimes"
43181,"it doesn't say Great Sea though, it says Ancient Sea, as in the ancient sea from Skyward Sword.

A BIG different between the Rito in Wind Waker and BOTW is that in WW in order to get wings they need help from Valoo."

45465,"I totally forgot to put a third possibility: those are the sages from OOT BEFORE Ganondorf destroyed them (since child timeline is Link going back to before meeting Zelda)

though this would mean that the OOT sages wouldn't awaken.

it IS said that they're fated to be sages though. That part about them can't change. They ""awaken"" to being sages, they don't ""become"" sages.

45850,"I thought ancient swords and stuff were a hundred years old. Like they were left by soldiers who died during the calamity.

Anyways, in Skyward Sword it's SPECIFICALLY called the ancient sea, like you get the ""ancient sea chart""

the Great Sea wouldn't even be 10k years old, it'd have to be even older than that. 10k years ago is when hyrule reached its peak and used the divine beasts to defeat Ganon. That means a long time would have to have passed before they reached their technological peak, never mind the sea receding, and people returning to found Hyrule again.

But returning to Hyrule completely undermines the point of Wind Waker, that is to say, letting go of the past. they create New Hyrule, with their own gods and stuff. Also, according to the Hyrule Encyclopedia the triforce was most likely destroyed after the king's wish in wind waker, so that throws a wrench in things.

As for the salt being found anywhere, that can easily be handwaved as a gameplay thing. It'd be annoying if you could only find salt by breaking rocks in specific areas that aren't defined at all, just for the sake of timeline theories.

53591,"Well one, who knows, considering how much time has passed, two it'd be REALLY annoying in terms of gameplay if you could only find it in places where the Skyward Sword sea was since there'd be zero indication.
"
104431,"yeah, though you get stuff like Impaz in the Hidden Village, stuff like that. It's probably safe to assume Impa isn't ALWAYS there, but it's always connected to the Sheikah (otherwise how would it keep coming back)
