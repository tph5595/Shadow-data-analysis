Honestly I don't understand how it's even being argued anymore. There's so much more evidence for downfall than either child or adult."
190038,"Zelda's line in the first memory isn't really anything. First, in other languages, she supposedly mentions a great sea, and a ""Link to the Past"", so it's likely it's just title drops as an easter egg.

It's also possible there was some sort of Twilight realm event in the Downfall Timeline. Midna says in Twilight Princess that as long as the Mirror of Twilight exists, Hyrule and her world are fated to cross, which is why she destroys it. But it exists before OoT, so it should be in every timeline.

Ruto became a sage in the backstory for BotW. She was the attendant to the Zora diety, and fought an evil man with a hero. Nabooru, and Darunia are also said to have become sages. There's no room for this in the Child Timeline. It only happens in the back story from the adult portion of OoT.

In the last memory in Breath of the Wild, Zelda appears to be wielding the full Triforce. The only timeline where we see anyone using the Triforce for an extended period of time is the Downfall Timline, where the Royal Family uses to lead Hyrule into brief golden ages between Ganon's attacks. The last time we saw the full Triforce timeline wise, was at the end of Zelda II.

The Tunic of the Wild is based on the classic Link design, and is said to be made by the Shiekah for the hero (and would likely be based on past outfits worn by past heroes, ala Wind Waker, and Twilight Princess).

You can find the ruins of Rauru Town in about the same location it would be in Zelda II.

Speaking of town names, Since Vah Medoh is the only Divine Beast not said to be named after a sage, it's possible that the Divine Beasts are named after the sages by way of being named after the towns they were found close to, or found by. With Vah Medoh being named after Mido Town.

There are enemies we've only seen in the Downfall Timeline, like the Lynels.

Downfall offers a reasonable explanation for the Rito, in that they could have come from the Fokka after their mission to protect the location of the Trifoce of Courage was finished. This accounts for all the differences in biology and culture they have from the Wind Waker Rito, and gives us a plausible origin since they super obviously didn't come from the Zora in BotW.

Finally, the Amiibo descriptions of The Sword of Six Sages, and Wolf Link mention that they come from other worlds, where as the Sword from the 8-bit Link Amiibo, as well as the Tunic of the Hero imply they're from the past.

As for your map thing, I'm not sure what point you're trying to make with that, but Hyrule's geography changes all the time game to game."
302397,"It's possible there was a sage of the Rito tribe named Medli, but Vah Medoh's name fits Mido better, and would keep it named after something that actually existed in it's timeline (since this is 100% not an adult timeline).

What evidence do you have to suggest the Rito evolved from a group of Zora? Because it's incredibly unlikely. The Zora, Gorons, and Hylians didn't change at all over all those years, and the Shiekah, and Gerudo have only minor changes. Why would the Rito take so much longer? 

Also, Wind Waker's 100 years is a mistranslation. It's actually thousands of years after OoT, so there's plenty of time for the Rito to develop.

The most damning piece of evidence, besides all the obvious ones like differences in biology and culture, is the symbols. The Wind Waker Rito use a symbol a lot like the Zora symbol, but they have their own in Breath of the Wild.

You are right that the fact that Zora's domain was rebuild could be evidence of the downfall timeline, but it's probably not correct to say that the Zora in Labrynna are the same from OoT. Gorons exist in Hyrule, Labrynna, and Holodrum, so the Zora in Labrynna are probably their own settlement. Maybe some of them traveled from Hyrule, but it's not certain."
310336,"The Divine Beasts are named after Sages, but my theory states that they're also named after towns. There's a Mido town in Zelda II.

The Rito, not having a sage of their own having only recently joined society, named their Divine Beast after the town it was found by."
314206,"I'm not saying it's absolutely the case, but it makes sense. Vah Medoh is the only Divine Beast not said to be named after a sage after all.

And actually, if you read my post, you'd notice that actually I'm saying the Rito joined society after Zelda II, which puts that moment before the backstory for Botw 10 000 years ago."
315410,"There's so much suggesting that they don't share a common ancestor with the zora.

They have FAR more in common with the Fokka. In a game that is supposed to draw so much influence from the original games, why would you have a race that is so similar to to a race from that game, only to have them not be related?

It might interest you to know that ""Fokka"" is a Japanese only name. The race never got a name back in the day, but we're called ""Bird Knights"", which is a much broader term but one that could definitely be used to describe Botw's Rito.  

As for the discrepancy of the talon hands to wings, some art does depict them as having wings, and I'll go on to say that the preferred weapon is a pretty terrible way to rule them out. 10 000 years is a long time. You said so yourself."
388927,"Why are you so certain that two worlds with a shared past but completely different history would lead to the Rito under two completely different circumstances, but with the same origins?

They're honestly barely even similar except for the name. It's more likely that the developers just named them the Rito because they didn't want to come up with another bird race name (even though they're clearly different races), than it is that they have the same origin under vastly different conditions.

It's rumored that the Zora in Wind Waker where turned into the Rito so they couldn't just find Hyrule. What reason could the Zora possibly have to change into the Rito in BotW."
394034,"The rumor could easily still be true if the Fishmen came after the fact (easily possible given the ammount of time passing between OoT and WW). It's also possible that the debt they feel they owe the King of Red Lions is related to this. We know they weren't around at the time of OoT, so it's in fact, pretty likely that they developed after the flood.

Korok's happen when they need to travel around growing forests. Plenty of room for that in the Downfall timeline. It could even be that the Korok's are the natural form, and they only took on the shape of children for Link's sake in OoT. That's a pretty defendable position, since every time they've been seen without Link, they're Koroks.

Honestly there's not a lot of things that don't make sense if you place it in the Downfall timeline."
398712,"Hyrule Encyclopedia isn't canon until Aounuma says otherwise.

He wasn't consulted for it like he was with Hyrule Historia, and Encyclopedia opens by saying it's writiers took liberties with the lore.

There's a lot of really just dumb stuff listed in it. Aside from your, very good, example, it also claims that all of Majora's Mask is basically inside Skull Kid's head."
