43405,"What you have to remember though is the Rito of BotW evolved differently than the WW Rito. In WW, they are basically humans with beaks for noses, and feathers. And they don't even get feathers until a dragon gives them a blessing. In BotW, the Rito are literally humanoid birds. Not Man-Birds, but Bird-men. The Zora are also slightly different, in that they encompass multiple fish species instead of just dolphin-y, and their colors can vary.

As for Koroks...the Kokiri/Koroks are forest spirits/sprites. The form of little plant people is far safer than a child wandering around  during the whole Calamity time...considering the guardians, Calamity Ganon, and large number of creatures."
