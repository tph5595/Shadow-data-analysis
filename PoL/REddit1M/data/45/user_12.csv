27061,"Well let's bounce through it: Ruto was a sage in this timeline. So that leaves us with 2 possible timelines: Downfall and Adult. Can't be adult cause they say Ganon is a continuous problem in Hyrule. In WW they stab him in the head and flood Hyrule and he was Ganon like one time.

So were left with Downfall. 

Unless you think Zelda's one line about Twilight totally makes it in the child timeline."
