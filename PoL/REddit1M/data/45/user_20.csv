34140,Not in the CT. That's why the sages were different in TP.
45084,"&gt;those ARE the sages from OOT, that's just what they look like now (and this would mean Ruto was destroyed by Ganondorf)

Eh, that's kinda stretching it. 

&gt; those are new sages because the oot sages already passed on

Considering the fact that Ganondorf's execution was only a few years after the Hero of Time informed the King about his crimes, I doubt that they're new sages. 

Either way, I don't see how the OoT sages could become sages in the CT, since Link never awakened them as sages. That was basically the whole point for the Hero of Time's journey, which didn't happen in the CT. "
