Even down the the great plateau being right where link's house's plateau thing is in ALttP, the only thing that doesn't seem right is gerudo desert until you realized that the mountains line up with the ones in the gerudo highlands.

Villages obviously move around, like how kakariko village has never been in the same general area in a zelda game due to them being thousands of years apart, but otherwise i only noticed a few things that seem off like how hyrule castle is slightly lower and the lost woods are slightly higher, but in general the relative positioning of all of the landmarks line up perfectly. It's probably a coincidence but i haven't seen anyone point this out before.

I do like to think that yeah, while they are in different timelines, I doubt global timeline was affected by the split. BotW is obviously much further along it's respective timeline than ALttP is in it's timeline, and I have a headcanon to go along with this that theorizes that the global climate shifted to be a lot colder than in other zelda games. No other zelda game has as much snow and wintery areas than BotW, and it ties together the whole thing pretty well and wraps up a lot of the remaining loose ends. Even without it being 100% accurate, I think this matches up with the map of BotW a lot more than even games like Ocarina that clearly inspired the layout of hyrule in this game quite a bit. What do you guys think?"

11645,"It's been tens of thousands of years since the last zelda in the timeline, kakariko village moves every zelda game. Village locations change in every zelda game. In botw it's west, in ALTTP its east, in twilight princess it's south, villages change locations all the time likely due to being destroyed or migrating etc. "
