I mean, one can pretty easily assume the Twilight Realm still exists in the other timelines, there might have been other adventures into the Twilight Realm.  

This game overall is pretty confusing to place.  Having the Zora and the Rito at the same time bothers me.  I'm really hoping the DLC sheds some light on this."

We also know that Ocarina of Time occurs before the 10,000 years.  If this were the Wind Waker timeline, it too would occur before the 10,000 years.

Also, the ancient sea in Skyward Sword was more localized, while the Windwaker sea was more global.  The rock salt can be found everywhere."
