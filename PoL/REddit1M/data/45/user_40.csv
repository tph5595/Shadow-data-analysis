267604,kakriko doesnt like to stay in the same place
284915,"well when we look at all the games kakariko has been in, in alttp it was just a normal town west of the castle, and in ablw it was in the same place because it was mostly copying locations. in ocarina of time, everything got moved around, now kakariko was at the foot of death mountain and was formerly a sheikah town, as although impa founded it, only hylians lived there, and in TP, although it looks completely different, its still at the foot of death mountain and only inhabited by hylians. there was a hidden village in TP that was home to sheikah, but still also in eldin. the new kakariko is around south of zoras domain, thats the first time its been there in any game. if botw is a downfall timeline game i could see that location of the first temple being necluda maybe, but idk, im just commenting on how kakariko keeps changing places but they never actually say its a moving village."
285072,"no adventure of link is northern hyrule. not just the northern part of the map, but on a landmass north of hyrule, where death mountain and the whole map from zelda 1 is on the very south. the map from zelda 1 is the hyrule from all the other games since death mountain is always north in them except for AoL, because it takes place north of it."
285489,"maze island in AoL is a naturally formed maze of mountains and cliffs and whatnot, whereas the maze in botw are ruins built by someone."
285897,"youre right about the beginning parts but... medoh is named after medli because its the beast of the rito tribe. it doesnt mean that they named it like that because medli existed in that timeline, which kinda worries me because its clear they other 3 were named after sages and if there really was a medli in this timeline, then there are too many contradictions in this game (as if there werent any before that) the rito probably evolved from a tribe of zora too, it took them 100 years to become fish people to kinda-bird people, so 10,000 years to evolve isnt far fetched. also i want to add that in the stone tablets in zoras domain, they said they founded zoras domain 10,000 years before the events of botw, meaning there was  a time when they didnt live in that exact spot which is kinda interesting and supports the downfall timeline because it means the zora were gone for a time being (they went to the land in oracle of ages) and then likely returned sometime after zelda 2. "
286030,"i mean... zelda 2 is a direct sequel, alttp was intended to be a prequel, and links awakening was a sequel to alttp, then aunuma came along and.... oot was the ultimate prequel for the time being, MM was the direct sequel to that, and wind waker was confirmed around the time it came out that it took place after one of oot's endings, and when TP came out they confirmed it was after ""the other ending"" so we had a split timeline confirmed long before hyrule historia."
286191,"she was also said to have fought ganondorf/ganon which she did not do in the child timeline because ganondorf was arrested and sent to arbiters grounds. then the sages which took the form of golden old men attempted to execute him but coulnt because he just then got the triforce of power cuz divine prank.

it was a divine social experiment."
286491,"ok can you point to where it says ruto helped fight against ganondorf in the child timeline? either from TP or hyrule historia. because not only did she become a sage, but they also say in botw that she fought against ganondorf, and they only said that ganondorf was arrested after link told zelda about the future, and that the sages that tried to execute ganondorf were in a different form from the oot sages."
306666,"but again, you say zora, gorons, and hylians didnt change at all however did you forget about the koroks? theres no reason why they would call it mido, like none, each tribe had their divine beast named after an important historical figure from the past who was a part of their tribe, why would the rito, a race of bird people, have their beast named after a kokiri, and a kokiri that wasnt even a sage or anyone important, just a snarky asshole with no historical significance? medoh does sound like mido, i can understand that, but the names of the beasts arent perfect anagrams. ruto became ruta, nabooru became naboris and you get the picture. its likely that there may have been a rito leader or whatever named medli that just exists to fill in some gaps. "
311064,"sorry but incredibly farfetched. and mido town isnt even close to the tabantha region, its far to the north east of death mountain. it really does sound like youre trying to find a way to make the name medoh make sense in the downfall timeline when the simplest answer is that it was named after an alternate timeline medli. and you dont know when the rito appeared in the timeline, youre assuming they appeared recently when 10,000 years is a really long time."
314604,"but thats all theories. i did read, and the rito and fokka both being birds a coincidence. if they were fokka, nintendo would have called them fokka unless they thought rito would be better than a name that kinda sounds like fucka which would be both dumb and funny. though the rito and fokka still have a few differences too, the fokka have talons for hands and not wing-hands, which they used to carry swords and shields, the rito in botw fly and exclusively use bows."
388061,"sorry thats still stretching it. its a cool concept to have a former enemy become a new pal, like the zora, but heres the facts. the rito in wind waker evolved from zora, they decided to name the bird race in this game rito as well, hinting that they are the same race (but different timeline) with the village song as well. if they werent the same race, they wouldnt have called them rito. please dont speculate about what you really dont know and call it facts, what we do know suggests they are simply just redesigned ritos. nothing more and nothing less. "
389870,"the rumor part isnt really true because of the fishmen (the guys who fill out your map, which i gotta say incase you dont know what im talking about because their name is too generic) being able to find hyrule themselves. and the koroks also appeared despite there not being any flood. we can safely assume koroks exist for survival reasons and the great flood was one of many situations that would cause the kokiri to change, as for the rito, if they are named rito, and until we know for certain that the developers named them that out of laziness like you said, then as far as im concerned, they are rito. as for why they changed in this timeline, im still waiting on revised timeline stuff to add botw, they revealed an easy timeline placement back when albw cam out, so they better come out and explain themselves about botw and the many things that dont make sense."
395407,in hyrule encyclopedia they confirmed that kokiri originated as hylians. so the evolution went like: hylian-&gt;kokiri-&gt;korok
