45290,"The landmarks with the strongest matches are Death Mountain, Zora's River, Hyrule Castle, and the Gerudo Desert. But with the sole exception of Zora's River in TP, those features have *always* been in roughly those locations. Gerudo Desert is always in the west or southwest, Death Mountain is always in the north or northeast, Zora's River is (almost) always south or southeast of Desth Mountain, and Hyrule Castle is always centrally located. If you rotate Ocarina's map 45 degrees, you get a pretty close match on all of those features as well, and apart from Zora's River, TP is a near-exact match as well. Hell, even the original NES game had all those landmarks in roughly the same locations (except Hyrule Castle, of course)

In other words, I don't think this is a direct reference to LTTP (although the plateau might be). I think it's just a result of the fact that they're both maps of the same place, with the differences being mostly a matter of different games abstracting the map in different ways, and a tendency for a handful of landmarks (Kakariko, the Lost Woods, and Zora's Domain) to move around a bit."
45455,"Problem is, that's not ""Tabantha Village"". That's *Kakariko* Village, which in LTTP is in *western* Hyrule.

As far as I know, ""West Kakariko"" only exists in LTTP and LBW, so it's probably a Downfall Timeline-only thing. Every other game with Kakariko puts it in the east, although BOTW is the first time it hasn't been in the Death Mountain foothills."

Also, does that mean Ganon's dungeon in the original LOZ is the Fire Temple?"

The Zora and the Rito share a common ancestor, but have since diverged into two separate species."
