56103,You definitely should have beaten it a long time ago. There's definitely not 140 hours of worthwhile content in that game. You must really enjoy tedium and repetition. 
56182,"Yeah, that describes the first 20-30 hours, which is still pretty amazing. 

Most games don't have 20 hours of *new* content. "
56237,Way to not even hint at how/where you can do that. 
56304,"It's a very hollow/shallow game. It's super repetitive, the story is flat out bad, the acting is bad, the bosses are terrible. There's a lot to like, but to not admit that's it's lacking is silly. "
56320,You really need to play a couple other Zelda games. 
56389,"Probably because ""exploring"" insinuates you're going to find something of value. This game is only filled with busy work, and not real, valuable content. "
56483,"You just started. Keep playing. You'll find everything you need naturally. 

""Defeat Ganon"" is the absolute last thing you'll do in the game, so it's a little misleading that they tell you that up front. That'll be in 80-100 hours. "
56496,"Ha! Sure you will. 

You're in the first 5 hours. There's no way you're ready for that yet. "
