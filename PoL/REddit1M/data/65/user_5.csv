45238,I think part of the way they thought they could offset this is to use the korok seeds as a way to force people to explore and they were hoping that would be the reward. unfortunately they overdid it and there's so many that even finding one isn't enough of a reward in itself. I even really enjoy the game but I agree with most of your sentiments. 
45897,yea this is why I loved the addition of the korok mask in the dlc I'm a completionist and not collecting them all would bug the he'll out of me but without the mask I would be given up a long time ago. still not too close to getting them all though.
