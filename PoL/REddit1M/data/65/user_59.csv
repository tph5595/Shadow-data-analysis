I really liked the Zora storyline... I hope there is more of it.
I was a bit disappointed with the master sword thing. The shrines are okayish to learn mechanics but nothing more.

The thing with botw is. It is not the best in everything it does, but most of the combination it does make it feal like a great game. 
Means, eventhough the graphics are not good, the variety is not good, the game is not the best, the dungeons are not the best and to few, even though the open world aspect is not the best and the nostalgic feeling is not the strongest with this game, it is one of the best games you could imagine on this console.

For me it is promising for a much better Zelda in the future, even though this game has got me."
