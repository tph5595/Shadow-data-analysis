45684,"Very true, the koroks were a great addition imo (although they could have done with more information about them being given, increasing in available information as you find more of them) but for a lot of them the puzzle they ""give"" and the reward you get out of them isn't enough to offset the giant size of the game and the lack of other sort of explorative rewards.  

Also since you don't really have a way to know if there even is a korok or not somewhere, it quickly turns to either having to check every square inch (which is too far towards the other side of the spectrum of ""combing through an area"") or just saying fuck it and only pikcing up the ones you find through sheer luck while just walking past there for different reasons"
46411,"IMO the korok mask is like a little bandaid for a body-wide cut tho.  

it helps but it needed to be deeper (and not be part of paid dlc tbh)

12530,Its an amiibo drop
12571,The more I play it the more I remain dissapointed but somewhat hopefull towards the future
15732,"Cause for me, Breath of the Wild is the best Zelda engine made so far, but they forgot to make a Zelda game in it.  

So I am hopefull that all the new engine stuff from BotW (few loading screens, Special Physics interactions, great designs even for  ""unimportant"" NPCs, etc...) is taken over towards the future towards a time where they actually manage to make a Zelda game with it all."
16301,"I disagree completely on that  

It lacked heavily in story events, strong character moments, Enemy variety (both mooks and bosses), extremely lacking dungeons, horrendous final battle, lacking music and has an ironic lack of meaningfull exploration."
16443,"It's not *just* the story stuff tho   
IMO the gameplay itself was good but the utilization of it and the progression of strenght for the player felt pretty bad.  
"
17572,"Idisagree, BotW barely has any MEANINGFULL exploration.  
What it has is pissing around a field, seeing some ruins in the distance and by the time you reach them you already saw everything there is to see to those ruins.  

IMO true exploration would have been achieved by stuff like seeing Akala Citadell in the distance, going over there and then finding a way in and EXPLORING its inside.  

What BotW has is a world that supports ""navigation"", not ""exploration""  

.

The lack of really good dungeons strongly helped with that lack of exploration.   
If the game had had more areas that were designed like Hyrule castle was sprinkled around in most/all regions, THAT would have been a world you could trully explore  

.

But as it stands now, BotW is the first Zelda game that has ever dissapointed me (maybe ignoring Four Swords but that was cause I already played Four Swords Adventures by then.)"
18584,"That's the issue actually, I DON'T agree all those things come together right.  
in fact, That is WAY more how I would describe stuff like WW, TP, SS even PH, ALBW, TFH and ST, which all had weaknesses for sure, but they worked with them and utilized the strengths of each to make all of those games amazing experience.  

BotW's strengths should have been its apocalyptic setting, huge world to show off that setting and the physic system, but they don't make it all come together at all.  

We are left with a huge world that is supposedly trying to make me feel how bad the Calamity was, but we have no context for any of it, cause this is still the biggest and most populated Zelda world we have ever seen and they completely fucked up the memories' focus causing those to be useless to get a scale of what we lost as well.  

The special ""everything reacts to each other"" overworld is also a great idea, but poorely utliwed, which for a big part is cause of how you pretty much get all your abilities in the first percent of the game, including the Glider which turns overworld exploration into way too much of a mindless cakewalk tbh.  

As a result I find that It's an amazing ""open world, do whatever"" game, but a sucky Zelda game 

.

&gt;I'm not through the game. I really liked the Zora storyline... I hope there is more of it. I was a bit disappointed with the master sword thing. The shrines are okayish to learn mechanics but nothing more.  

Prepare for dissapointment then is what I'd say, the Zora questlines pretty much stops a small way past their divine beast and their ""area"" is the most worked out out of the 4.  
Rito and Gorons are nowhere near the Zora in quality; Gerudo are closer but all together it remained a big dissapointment.  (especially when compared to how amazing all the designs for them are)  "
36902,"Same, Worst is that from the few good songs, many are essentially ""borrowed"" from other games.  

I think pretty much the only really top tier song that didn't feel under/missused and wasn't a remix from older games was the Molduga battle"
37078,"PersonallyI don't find emulting the original game a good thing when it is done by ignoring all the advancements/""evolution"" the series has gone through"
37999,"Same, the Sacred Beast quests are also pretty weak in the first place"
39398,"Technically you could consider anything ""exploring"".  

But IMO true explorational value comes from having an area you need to explore to gain something, whether it be the gain the items that is there, to gain access to what lies beyond ot even just to gain information on what that area is/used to be.  

the overworld doesn't actually have this, you ""explore"" a region of the overworld and find some places that have a guy living nearby or a vageu allusion to having been something else before, but you never really gain anything of ""value"" out of it (again imo)  

It is definitly possible to have a world that has true exploration without ever stepping inside of some temple, caves or so forth, but in that case you still need to have a bigger focus on ""combing"" through an area to find its value than BotW offers.  

In fact, parts of BotW do actually give this value on some base level (Hyrule castle, lost woods, Yiga hide out, some of the snow areas some of the shrine quests locqtions) but ussually it is nowhere near what would be needed to offset the massive size of the game in both quality and quantity.  "
40711,"Bot's ruins are way to samey and undetailed/un-thought-out to fit that criteria for me.
