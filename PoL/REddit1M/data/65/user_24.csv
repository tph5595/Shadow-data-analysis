11264,One thing I really hope they add in dlc 2 is a place to store more weapons.  Three slots in your house isn't nearly enough with how many rare weapons there are.  Maybe they'll have an option to increase the size of your house?  Or maybe even have a second house for you to buy in a different region.
31337,Just one that you can purchase in Hateno village.  Go behind the house across the small bridge to the right of the shrine and talk to the drag queen.  Oh and bring a bunch of wood
