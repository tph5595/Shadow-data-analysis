56121,"Yeah, I knew he was at stables. I ran across him at one while playing with my son on our shared game the other day and I didn't even think about it."
56317,"Oh, yeah, I'm sure you're totally right. I think I was probably over-stating it to try to not just dismiss that guy's criticism out of hand. I only played with him once, when I first got off the Great Plateau. Even with 3 hearts, he was OP. I couldn't figure out how to dismiss him, so I killed him, lol. Then I didn't summon him again until at least 150 hours later when my 5 year-old was playing and asked if we could use ""those statues you have."" And it occurred to me that he might be a good anti-handicap for a five year-old, lol.

But, yeah, mine only has 3 hearts. I sadly sold my copy of TP:SE without even having played it (I still have it for the Wii, though. I referred to the Wolf has Wolf Link and my son was like ""WAIT! Link is a Wolf, too?!"" That then led to me explaining what TP is, which led to him asking if we could play that, which led to us starting TP.)."
56391,"Ooooh...

And I guess one way to figure that out would be by looking at signs around the world, like the one that says ""Link's House"" and such. Thanks, I think I'm gonna try that."
56441,"Yes, but you have to put them on separate Switch profiles. So, I have my game on my profile and my son's on his."
60337,"Oops. Well, then not that sign, I guess.

Oh, wait, the map. Anywhere it says stuff in English, it also has Sheika script, yeah?"
66326,Haha...thanks. 
35880,"Thanks for not spoiling it. I'm at the part where you to have to find a certain person to help him and I am nearly at my wit's end trying to figure out where said person could be, but I refuse to look it up.

I am at a similar point in finding the hidden memories. How in the hell are you supposed to find a random path in a random forest?!"
35922,"Yay! I only have a few amiibo, but that is one of the ones I own. "
35990,"Yeah, I only have this one, Wolf Link, Smash Bros. Link, and Smash Bros. Ganon. "
36103,"Yeah, I'm the same. Well over 100 hours in and still working on my first play-through. I also have a game that's about 30 hours or so that is my 5 year-old son and I playing together, though."
36437,"With the exception of Epona, they are all very trivial. They drop fruit and arrows and small amounts of rupees and then collectible items that are explicitly worse than what you can just find on random mobs. By the time you can get the amiibo to drop this sword in the picture, for instance, which does 22 damage, you are likely carrying 10+ swords that do over 60. 

Epona and Wolf Link are really the only things that you can get that are materially actually game-changing. Epona is a really great horse, but there are plenty of horses nearly as good as her that you can just catch. Wolf Link...~~yeah, he actually kind of breaks the game~~ can be moderately useful, especially if you fully upgraded him on the Wii U first (he has a number of hearts based on how many levels you completed in the challenge dungeon or whatever - I actually sold my Wii U and that version of TP before doing it, so mine only has 3 hearts). I actually just use him when my 5 year-old plays so that he isn't constantly dying. 

Anyway, I understand where you're coming from. I only have 4 amiibo and almost never use them in the game. I actually was worried that they would be game-breaking because I first used them immediately after leaving the Great Plateau. I stopped using them until I got to the end game content and wanted to ""collect them all"" as much of the armors as I could. But I don't think there is anything wrong with having them actually, you know, do something in a game. Especially when it's essentially just cosmetic collectibles that don't affect game play."
36635,"I bought the three I have on eBay back before the game came out and the profiteers had swooped in. Got 8bit Link, SSB Link, and SSB Ganon for between $7-15 each. And then Wolf Link is part of the Wii U Twilight Princess package, which I bought, opened up for the amiibo, and then resold immediately without playing for just $10 less than the original cost, so that one was basically $10.

But, yeah, I hear that they are hard to come by these days. I've seen a few of the newer ones at Target."
36874,"RIGHT! Argh! How did I forget about him?!

Thank you. Gonna start hitting up those stables."
