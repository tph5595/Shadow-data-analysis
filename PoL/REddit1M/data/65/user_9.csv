45814,There's a different way you can find those memories if you want to be adventurous. When looking at the memory pictures if you look in the upper corner there will be some sheikah writing. That can actually be translated into English if you know what letter each symbol represents and they will give you a hint about the location of memory. It's how my friends and I did it and it was a lot more fun than just talking to the painter
60874,I like you're gusto. Personally I wasn't crazy enough to try and actually decode each glyph and found a picture online that showed which letter each symbol represented and then just translated the text with that. But that's not to say it's impossible. I believe in you.
