65079,"And I have a hard time imagining that anyone who loved OoT and MM could *not* love BotW. They were indeed my favourite games in the series until BotW came out. To each his own I guess.

It takes quite a lot of things I loved about those games to a whole new level. That feeling of walking out on to a massive Hyrule Field. The ability to jump on horseback and go on an *adventure* across open grassy plains (this is big for me). The way the music cuts at night and you're running around with nothing but the sound of crackling torches, birds cawing, a windmill spinning, a skulltula in the distance. The latter in particular is something that I felt the N64 games nailed and no subsequent game in the series got right before BotW. It adds so much to the atmosphere (and BotW does it during the day too)."

Bit disappointed we didn't find out more about expansion pack 2 today in that Nintendo direct, I was really hoping we'd get a trailer for it and some more info. I'm as excited for that as I am for any other game coming out this year."

Two playthroughs (my first normal mode playthrough and my first on master mode) took over 100 hours each because I took my time and went and did all 120 shrines, etc. Some were closer to 30-35 hours if I just did whatever shrines I needed to do for the Master Sword, and went straight for the divine beasts while grabbing the memories along the way."
