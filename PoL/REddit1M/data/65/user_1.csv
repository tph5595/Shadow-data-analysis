44768,"Can't be found, it's a possible drop from the 8-bit amiibo "
44865,Yeah I agree on the progression. There definitely was a feeling of progressing in strength but it just didn't feel as good as hidden skills 
44283,"Idk man, hard mode Master Trails was a hell of a ride"
44538,"Interesting, I found wolf link to be pointless pretty early into the game, even with full hearts. He could only tank a hit or two and did negligible damage once you get past the reds. Found bomb+ to be a much better from of crowd control"
