56049,I meant specifically the part about which language they base the translation on - your example is very interesting and informative. :)

It's doubly fun for me, as I've been playing Zelda since I was a kid - incredible to compare BotW to 8-bit LoZ, and everything in between.  I remember being IN AWE of OoT - BotW nearly brought me to tears when I started playing. The wave of nostalgia is real. "
