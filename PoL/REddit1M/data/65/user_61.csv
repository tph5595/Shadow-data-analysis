26100,"I agree that it lacks enemy variety, but I would say that was done intentionally to keep the game tight and tied together, thematically and material-wise.  Each new enemy would require new droppable parts that could be potentially mixed with everything else in the game for elixirs and whatnot.
 I do like how there are repeated overworked bosses--hinoxes and moldugas and taluses remind me of the giant squids from wind waker, and I think there were only like eight or ten of those

It doesn't have as much music as other games but if you think about it, it still has quite a few tracks that I love.  I would be happier with the soundtrack, though, if they had more broken background music like they did with the temple of Time, for example at lake hylia which is silent.

But here's the thing about BotW.  When I was little I played wind waker a lot, and it's still my favorite Zelda.  But I remember visiting the small section of hyrule in that game and thinking, ""Wow, wouldn't it be cool if I could just explore the entire place, just like I can explore the whole ocean in this game?""  In wind waker you can just sail wherever.  You might not have the items you need but you can still GO places.  The sense of freedom was amazing, and I always wanted an on-the-ground, Wind waker open, riding a horse Zelda.  I wanted that when I was like seven, and now years later they've finally given us a sandbox hyrule.  Meaningful exploration, though, has always been weird in Zelda--I remember one time when I was little, I thought, ""I wish I would find something _other_ than a heart piece when exploring, that would make things more interesting.""  I would say there's a lot more to find in Breath of the Wild than other games--spirit orbs, puzzles, money, weapons, new locales, old locales, new people, etc.  but it still has the same problem where you know everything is gonna lead you to a shrine so there's not much excitement. 

Skyward sword, I should mention, was NOT that at all--it was the opposite.  Not open, very linear, and obviously not an on-the-ground classic hyrule adventure.  It tried to emulate Wind Waker's ocean with the islands in the sky, which it did okay, but there weren't _that_ many interesting islands. Still LOVED that game, though, strongest story in the series imo.

Sure, the narrative isn't really there, but another game I played as a little kid was NES Zelda.  I could never beat it because I was too little, but there was no narrative in this game, just an opening monologue and freedom to explore.  This game emulates that really well, and I think this game ends up being a special entry.  It's the whole garden-in-your-drawer thing, and personally I'm okay with sacrificing story for now.  But when you say ""they forgot to make it a Zelda game,"" I totally get what you mean, and I hope the DLC adds some good story

Oh and one more thing, the final battle is awful.  Irredeemably so.  The first part could be forgiven for being a bit easy if the second part _wasn't an actual battle_.  That's the one thing I can't forgive about this game, other than taking away my sweet sweet kakariko village theme"
