43199,What site did you use to only spend 2 bucks on all amiibo cards? I'm only finding the price for a full set to be around 20 bucks and up. Single cards run around 5 bucks.
569832,"I'm really thinking about actually getting these soon. It asks for a size you'd like to order though, so what's up with that. Did they arrive for you yet?"
582933,"Okay cool, that's what's up"
1425932,That's good! So naturally you would have to spend 15-20 bucks to get the whole Zelda card set? I was hoping the order gives you all cards.
