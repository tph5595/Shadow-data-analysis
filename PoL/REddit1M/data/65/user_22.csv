51927,"Sheeit, just include a quest in DLC2 about rebuilding the Temple of time, where it becomes Link and Zelda's house (if you did all the memories), and then you can store a bunch inside (since the building is huge) 


And then it could have a room in the back like in OoT where you can place the Master sword (maybe it makes it more powerful), and lock it behind 3 gems you have to find around the map "

Like for example, a fifth power that instantly recharges the Master sword (maybe just partially, and with a cooldown afterwards), and has a quick animation that depicts you travelling back in time"
