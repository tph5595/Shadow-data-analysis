36606,You can buy little cards with NFC chips that mimic the amiibos.  I spent like 2 bucks to get all the Zelda amiibos 
574136,I clicked on 17! It's still on the airplane coming from China! I'll respond once I get it in
1419640,"okay, so it came in, after like 3 weeks of waiting i opened the package and it’s just a single white credit card shaped piece of plastic. The package said it was the bokoblin. it worked! 

That being said, i’m sure you could order specific amiibo through this seller, surely the numbers correlate to a specific one. "
