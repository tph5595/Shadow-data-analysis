15890,How did they forget to make a zelda game with it? This is the most zelda of any zelda game. 
17325,The only thing I agree with is the final battle was too easy. Exploration was also not as advertised but even so the exploration was better than anything we've had in a previous 3D zelda. Hyrule field is completely barren in OoT and TP. Wind waker doesn't have much of anything meaningful in the ocean except collect treasure chests and find fairy fountains.
