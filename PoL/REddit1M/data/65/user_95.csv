Those and any weapons I think are badass but I don't want to actually use and break: like the Fierce Deity Sword to complete that outfit, the Sword of the Six Sages, or the entire Royal Guard equipment to complete the [Dark Link](/spoiler) look."

It also unlocks some post-game side quests that can only be done after you've beaten Ganon once."
150179,"For me, BotW is just a whole separate genre of Zelda game. It won't do anything to dislodge my current favorite Zelda's (MM, OoT, WW) but in the new genre of ""open-world Zelda games"" BotW is on top. (It's also the only game in that genre, except maybe the original LoZ)

Yeah they had to cut a lot of the classic Zelda features out because of the open-world design, but what they added instead goes above and beyond what the other classic Zelda games could've dreamed of.

Also I feel like BotW is what they wanted Ocarina of Time to be, in some aspects: they mentioned wanting OoT to have a persistent world where grass you cut stays cut and footprints stay where you left them. BotW has features like that (though it's still limited by real life and the game can't remember *every single flower* you cut, but it does remember the important things like monsters killed and ore deposits broken)."

150454,"And after a while you come across new enemy camps, and you're like ""is it even worth my time breaking into this camp? they probably don't even have a treasure chest they're protecting, and even if they do, it's probably some crappy item I don't need anyway"""
