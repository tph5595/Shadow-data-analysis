I find it very hard to imagine anyone that loved games like OOT and MM also loving BotW. Those other games best moments are almost always in the characters and dungeons... BotW is best at having a really interesting overworld with some cool things to see."

Give it 5-6 cool well designed dungeons with great bosses, monster variety, and a few more interesting characters and right there you still have the open world they wanted to design but it also has a lot of other core things that are Zelda. They could easily have had those in it"
