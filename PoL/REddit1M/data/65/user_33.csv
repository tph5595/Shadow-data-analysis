I don't enjoy tedium, but to me, what Zelda is, isnt tedium. If it is for you, then maybe its not your game. Speed running a game is tedium to me, and not fun."
27236,"Yeah, but in his defense, in both cases its kind of a pain in the ass to get them here on reddit.  The Switch being a *tad* bit easier, but still quite a bit of effort. "
27325,Really? I still haven't finished my first and im like 140 hours in. 
27676,"yeah, i dont want to make a twitter account just to get the ability to download them back to my phone, just to re-upload them to reddit. When you talk about it like that, its just easier to take a picture with the phone, then you skip the twitter step. I agree it doesnt look as good, but its less hassle. "
27785,"and that takes a bit more time than it should. 

You should have the ability to copy them to like a USB flash drive. At least the Wii U option was a bit more convenient (if not just as time consuming) than the Switch. "
29412,Oh yeah. Im not like in a hurry or anything. I'm taking my time and enjoying the exploration and discovery of it all :) I like mucking about the world. 
29484,thats fair. I haven't tried taking screen shots on my PS3 (my only other non-Nintendo online system). Perhaps i am just spoiled by my PC and phone lol.
