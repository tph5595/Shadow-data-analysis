I am proposing a theory:

Not Link, but very similar to Link, with design elements that call back to multiple previous games? Maybe this is a customized character. Maybe this open world exploration Zelda will have character customization."

I would love for this to be a girl, and the only way I see that as possible would be for this to be a custom character somehow.

Also, the way Aonuma said it: ""No one explicitly said that was Link."" Use of explicitly to qualify suggests that this is maybe sorta Link, and there's not a lot of ways that character can be Link and also not explicitly Link at the same time.

And yeah, open world, more RPG leaning... it looks like there's some queues taken from western RPGs."
