14568,Wouldn't Tetra's mother be Zelda though? I thought Zelda was a name passed down through the royal family.
14770,"&gt;All that noted, this is a game mostly played by teenage boys. Part the enjoyment of the game is empathizing with the main character. Making a teenage girl link is going to be a bad move money wise and at the end of the day the real plot of zelda is collecting rupees.

They could just pull a Metroid and make the character ambiguous until the very end. Plus I don't see many complaints by teenage boys about Samus being a girl."
15102,"Sheik bound her breasts, this character could be binding too."
15703,You never know... It definitely is suspicious either way.
16761,"Oh it was definitely just a teaser, this didn't look like gameplay at all. I don't see them changing the design though. People don't seem to hate it, they're just confused. We've already seen Link in other outfits, it's just strange to have it the first outfit we're introduced to.

There wasn't any confusion about their gender until Aonuma said anything too.

I'm biased though, I think playing as a disguised (or unaware) Zelda would be really cool."
17141,"I just remember people saying that they looked really feminine, but everyone still referred to them as male. It's not like very pretty Links aren't expected.

Zelda is boring 90% of the time, but just like there are different Links, there are different Zeldas. If this character was Zelda, she seems like she'd be a really cool Zelda. I'd like there to be a cool Zelda that isn't Tetra."
18657,"I think at first people said that as a joke, but now with his comment they're thinking twice...

But anyways, yeah, if this was Zelda, she'd likely be in disguise (like Sheik) or unaware of her true identity (like Tetra). This character could continue that trend."
20121,"Oooh I see, that'd make sense."
66862,"I guess you're right, people might have a problem with that... If something like that did happen, I can see it being revealed at the very end (like in Metroid).

But I guess we've already had a Zelda game without Zelda (Link's Awakening), which if you think about it, is even weirder."
