3584,"That's what in thinking, he's just teasing people and probably thinking ""oh shit, did we really change the look of Link that much for them to question us?!"" "
4156,"Exactly, you can't drastically change an iconic 80's characters too much, it's kinda disrespectful to the original creators of the series. I just thinking they will change how Link looks before the game is actually released, this is reminding me of Infamous 2 when Cole had hair and everyone was pissed off because it made him look like Nathan Drake and not the Iconic bald head you would expect from his character. "
4342,"Not ever going to happen, she will always be the one to carry the triforce of wisdom. It comes with the gig or ruling a country, she needs to be wise to lead her people. "
5958,"We already played all the Links though, they're not constantly reincarnated, case and point is Wind Waker Link. They were expecting the Hero of Time but it was centuries before the Hero of Wind was born. No Link is the same Link, with the exception of a few from sequels, but they were all born the same. Male with white skin and brownish/blond hair. 

Same with Zelda always being Born a female with Brown/blond hair and being white. So no Link or Zelda were born a different gender in the history of Hyrule. "
6016,"Nope, it doesn't look like New Hyrule at all and looks more like Old Hyrule. Also you mean Son, not daughter, the Link in the teaser is male. "
6555,Hyrule of Historia would disagree with you. We've played all the Links and met all the Zeldas. 
6963,Yeah changes that had nothing to do with changing the gender of his characters. He most likely wouldn't like that bit. 
7061,"Pretty much stated in SS with demises curse but everyone is nitpicking saying ""Well they DIDN'T actually say anything about the GENDER!!"" 

It would be stupid for the Goddess Hylia to be male and even more stupid that her champion will be female. "
7159,"Already stated by the curse, there will never be a last Link or Zelda. They will forever reincarnate as themselves again and again without any knowledge of their past lives to keep fighting. 

I just find it funny people are nitpicking that it doesn't specifically state gender which is like ""what? you really need them to point it out for you?"""
7204,"Hylian, Link is always Hylian. "
7352,"Seeing how TMC is after SS I'm going to expect the hero was the SS link. Same with FS

The ALBW Link is already stated for the Hero of Time that was killed off in that timeline and Ganon taking over the scared realm which led to ALTTP Link in sealing him away. 

"
7505,In WW it was clear that he hid the triforce piece to hide away Zelda and what not. The original game didn't really have a concrete story yet so really anything was up to change then. Mario wasn't always a plumber either. 
7593,"Because Link is a mortal human. He destiny is really predefined, a goddess can change her shape and form whenever she wanted it to be, she just chose to be Zelda or w/e. 

Human soul =/= Goddess badass soul. "
7859,"Shit if I felt discomfort for playing a female character I would have totally ignored Metroid or tomb Raider games soo no. 

Humans are more limited than Gods so it's pretty simple to think that he doesn't have a choice in the matter unlike a Goddess. "
7929,"It's not hard to think that they took the triforce of wisdom and broke it off from the adult Zelda from Old Hyrule and gave a piece to her children and use it as a family heirloom. 

Remember that the triforce is a tangible object, you can grab and touch it. "
8075,"ALBW is when Adult Link failed to defeat ganondorf and died, I believe that was the timeline it was placed, same timeline in Oracle games and what not. 
"
8240,"I clearly stated He doesn't have a choice, it's right there in the second sentence. 

&gt;Humans are more limited than Gods so it's pretty simple to think that he doesn't have a choice in the matter unlike a Goddess.

He's stuck in an infinite loop of being reborn. When the Goddess choose her mortal form she choose Zelda now that is her loop she's stuck in. If anything the three goddesses don't really care about what's happening or they would have stop the reincarnation and let their spirits pass into the whatever spirits go in the zelda universe. "
8800,"Well the very first Link we know of is male but if this is before SS then there won't be any Zelda or Hyrule. Both were created after SS, Zelda being the reincarnation of Hylia and Hyrule being made in honor of the goddess. We'll see though. "
9221,"More like his essence and very being is. Also the goddess has no control over the curse, that's why it's a curse from Demise. "
9681,Lack of breasts is a big hint seeing how this Link is in his teenage years. 
9801,If I remember correctly Hylia was born from the 3 goddesses or something. If the game does take place before SS we'll probably see a whole set of new characters and environment and probably will never even see Hylia. At this point do we even call the game legend of Zelda anymore or do we call it Hyrule History? 
10773,"You're forgetting that in ALBW that people refer the event as a Legend. Legends are mostly told through word of mouth and stories, it's been centuries since Oot and ALBW so information gets lost in time. It's not that hard to figure out that in ALBW that they don't know the whole story like we do and just know the gist of it. "
13496,"Very much not Gerudo. He doesn't have olive skin or red hair to be considered as one, he has all the traits of a Hylian which is what Link always was. Braces can just be a style that was influenced by them. "
13625,"Small =/= none at all. Look at all the picks with him drawing his bow, his shirt is clinging to his chest and there's nothing there at all. 

Hell teenage girls have something there even a little bump but Link here has nothing. This dude is a dude. 

Also I'm just speculating that this is him in his younger teenage years. It would make more sense in why he looks so feminine compared to his older teenage years.  

Edit: This is a good [picture](http://i.imgur.com/bWGUVzC.png) highlighting his physique. All slender male build than a teenage girl. "
14386,"Yeah also forgot to mention the century child bit. I can understand the influence of gerudo fashion in clothing but I have no idea why people are jumping the gun and thinking Link is just now a gerudo all of a sudden. He was and will always be Hylian, hell they wouldn't even adopt him as a child seeing how he's a male and all. 

If anything its clothing he picked up during a trade which he uses or showing us that now we can customize our clothing. "
15189,"Could be, mostly likely not though. "
15826,"Hell I'm assuming this was just a teaser to show off the engine than actual gameplay. Everything is subject to change, reminds me of Cole in infamous 2 with hair. People hated that design and they switched it up. See the massive confusion of this character they will probably make him look more masculine. "
16941,"Oh no, people were very confused about his gender when it was first announced. Aonuma just said something to hype it up even more, he just loves teasing us, still waiting for the MM 3DS game. 

Meh, I wouldn't want to play as Zelda, if anyone I rather play as Impa. Now there is a badass with very little that is known about her people. Zelda is kinda a boring character to me when she isn't a pirate or shiek. "
17568,"Most of the comments were ""Link is a girl!"" type comments which people of course stated that's silly. It seems on on this sub that people are going on that bandwagon so much though. 

Zelda is a princess, they would never put royalty on the front lines. If we ever do get a game with Zelda as the protagonist it wouldn't be known she is Zelda till probably the end of the game. Its Zeldas alternate identities that are cool and awesome. "
49448,"Not every link is related to a previous Link. They're still all Hylian, so I don't really understand what you're trying to say. "
50007,"Exactly, thank you. Link will never be a girl just like Zelda will never be a boy or Samus being a man. They won't just change an iconic characters gender for the story, that's not how Iconic characters work. "
50469,But it's not his primary arrow unlike Zeldas'. We see countless weapons on Link in the trailer.  
50711,Wind Waker Link also doesn't know he's Hylian seeing the whole world was flooded and the distinction between the humans were lost. 
51098,"Exactly, I rather they make a spin off game while playing as Impa than gender bending Iconic characters. "
52535,"No, there still related not in the bloodline way but in the way of being the reincarnation of the same Link. Twilight Princess Link isn't related to any of the previous Link but his spirit is the same spirit. It's like the Avatar from the last airbender. Same soul but each with a different life. "
53470,"No, it's really important for an iconic character. I would be just as pissed if samus gets retconned into being a man, I would be insanely pissed at just the idea of it. I hate it when they change iconic characters so drastically they no longer resemble who the character was before hand. Just like fucking Dante in DmC, fuck that Dante, they destroyed Devil May Cry. 

You can scream sexist all you want but I just don't like when they change Iconic characters drastically just to spice things up. "
56107,"I'm not, I'm standing by my statement. "
59259,"Please keep calling me sexist, I fucking love it. I have no qualms on playing a female character in the Zelda universe, I rather it be a spin off with shiek or impa then changing the gender of Link. 

It's the same way that playing metroid game but Samus having a penis would destroy that character for me. I just don't like them fucking around with iconic characters. "
59514,"So let me get this straight.

Male Samus = bad because we don't get enough female protags

Female Link = good because we want more female protags


You're right, Female protags should be in Zelda games that we should play so why not let us play with the badass Impa that we've seen recently. We already have a female character to to explore her background not only of her but her people that we closely known nothing about. "
60276,"Oh I read it, I just don't care if there is 100 samus or 1 samus. Even if Samus had reincarnation like Link and she was always a women until a trailer showed her more muscular and everyone claiming she was a man I would also be pissed.

Pink hair links hair was Pink only because of technical limitations actually, it wasn't really meant to be pink. All Links do look effeminate but you can clearly tell he's a man like what we saw in the teaser. "
60957,"I love the sexism part, just because I don't want my heroic iconic character that I've known since childhood to change suddenly makes me sexies. 

I guess I should want samus as a man and complain about that all the time now when Metroid comes out or complain that Mario is a stereotype and scream racism everytime he pops up or opens his mouth. "
61576,"And I'm saying why change the gender of one character just to make a female protag when you already have a great female character to explore. 

This is like with Infamous second Son, we got Delsin and introduced to Fetch and her background, now they made a stand alone DLC to explore her more and her powers. 

I have no problems with female protags but why change the main game instead of branching out the universe of Zelda with other characters."
62950,"I love how you're going through my posts, I feel special and loved by you. "
62967,"Oh look it's you again, I'm feeling very special. "
64590,Because I'm not a god. 
64961,"Nope, the curse won't let him. He's forced to be born as himself, shape and all because Demise is a prick. "
65578,"Link was always a white hylian boy, the only thing that really changes is art style. "
66743,I also like going around throwing acid on women's faces because they wouldn't want to go out with me and go around heiling Hitler /s 
74203,"I would love to see a more magical based type warrior. We see a lot if board swords, shields and swords, and bows but never a character purely based on magic. "
75237,"The Doctor stated he wouldn't regenerate into a women, it wouldn't make him well him or so he puts in that one episode he was talking about one of his time lord pals that love to regenerate into every race and sex. 

I just don't think it's necessary for Link to be female when we already have a kickass female that they can make a spin off game about, Impa is badass or like someone else said a new character that uses magic as her primary attacks.   "
76516,That's not what sexism is. No part in my argument did I say women are inferior then men in any way shape or form. I just don't want them to change iconic characters just for the sake of change. 
79094,"Nope, this character just looks like a young teenage Link to me. He always looked effeminate, my point being is if they wanted to make a female protagonist for the Zelda universe then a spin off would be the best bet. "
80365,"Gameplay is what would bring in a wider audience, changing the main character drastically just pushes long time fans away. This is exactly just happened with DmC, they not only changed the character to something that they weren't and completely changed the gameplay.

The whole bigger world I explore bit that the dude was explaining alone should suffice In brining more players.   

Hell a lot of people just won't play it for the art style itself, still remember WW. "
81035,"That's what Capcom and Ninja Theory said, we saw how that turned out. "
82552,It's actually the fan holding unto the iconic character. I would also be pissed if I'm playing tomb raider and instead of Lara croft popping up it's Nathan drake. 
83270,"Also gameplay, it played nothing like the original games. We saw a shitty try hard Dante instead of the manly macho campy/goofy Dante and instead of the serious and cold honorable Vergil we got the baby killing ""my dick is bigger than yours"" Virgil. Holy shit the whole DmC game was filled with cringe induced lines. "
86465,"It's cool, I never said it wasn't. I'm saying you don't just change the gender of the iconic character just to spice things up. 

If they want to have a female protag there are plenty of kickass people in the zelda universe that can take that place in her own spin off game. Impa being a big one which could also explore her back story and her people. This could take place before the Hero is even found or does his shit, this would also give a rare insight of the throne room and see what Zelda actually does other get kidnapped. I want to see her command her kingdom, we've haven't seen that once yet. "
89135,"In the teaser he also looks undisputably male. He looks like a young boy, that's the first thing that popped in my head when I saw him. 

The only thing Aonuma wants to shake up is too make the world a real explorable world just like and not mini instances in a big map. It also showed some cool new tech but the Link in the trailer was male. "
97032,"To be fair they only did as a young boy and not a young teen from 13/15 like this Link looks like. 

The teaser just looks like a slightly younger SS Link to me but not so young like MM and SS. Wind Waker Link was also around 15-16 years of age but the art style of it wasn't like TP or SS. "
