22635,"Except that Zelda has Golden Hair.  Like, bright sun-gold hair.  Not brown hair.  That would be link.

EDIT: Also, I don't disagree about the eyes, waistline, hips *SHOULDERS* and breasts."
22922,"There is ""Effeminate"" and then there is ""Female"".

This is a female.

It also isn't Zelda.  Zelda has sunshine gold colored hair, not brown or dirty blonde."
22962,"If you didn't see her chest, you weren't paying close enough attention.

Try when she is jumping off the horse; frame by frame; side-boob on right side under arm."
23076,"If you think this is a male, you need to maybe rewatch this in slow motion and pay attention to all the things that would make a girl a girl."
26777,"A small enough chest, in that tunic, wouldn't be obvious from all angles in front, especially with the cell-shaded method they're going with... but there are definite angles during the shooting-arrow portion of the video that indicate curvature."
51284,"Yeah, those curves? Those curves ain't boy."
52238,"You know, your link doesn't actually look anything like the video, as it looks like someone smoothed out the curves.

I can post [images too](http://imgur.com/a/zOgbW).  But it's also probably harder to photoshop the [actual video.](http://youtu.be/XZmxvig1dXE?t=3m6s).

Note at Time index 3:26 the curvature of her chest as well as the curvature of the back and shoulders, and again at time index 3:27.  Look at 3:27 and how the arm contacts the shoulder, the shape of said shoulders in relation to the neck and head.  Look at the thighs.  

Watch at Time Index 3:32 as she jumps from the horse.  At 3:34 there is again more indication of curvature of breasts.  At time index 3:39, note how the chest folders OVER the leather strap."
52997,"Hair color is an argument.  Whether it's a definitive argument or not is a completely separate matter, but it is an argument in support that this is either Link or a female relative.

Female because... (http://imgur.com/a/zOgbW)"
57058,"So your refutation is that the video itself is messed up and that the one image you linked is proof.

I can see there won't be any reasoning with you.  We'll just have to wait and see."
57674,"As may be, the vast majority of her portrayals have her with sun-gold hair.  This isn't in refute, even if there has been an instance of her having brown hair before."
58273,"Except that the thing you mention as a known shop seems to be reflected in the blurry video you claim is inaccurate.

If you have a better quality version of the E3 presentation, by all means supply it, I'll take a look."
58955,"So what I'm getting is you don't have any better quality video? You'll note in my original citation regarding the picture that all I stated was that I could post images too, but that it is harder to shop a video... so I'm not claiming the picture I posted was accurate.

Do you have a better quality video?  And also, why are you so butthurt that this link may be a girl?"
60656,"Then again; this turns into a waiting game.  Waiting for more media to determine who happens to be correct.

This is the first, and only, Zelda where a preview made me think that the person being portrayed was a girl.  While Link has been effeminate in the past, I've never quite gotten the impression he was a girl in any of the previous iterations of the game in preview videos.

A whole lot of people seem to have gotten that same impression, enough so that there are arguments about it.

I do disagree with you regarding the items indicated in the time stamps indicated, and I'm not certain whether or not they'll let you customize your character (Which would seem strange in a Zelda Game), I do think that it would be a very interesting change of pace to have a female Link.  Far and above more interesting than being able to customize your character."
62083,I think it'd be more interesting if a female link rescued a female zelda.
65656,"Well... it would represent a bold move in the gaming industry, an alternate gender character of a internationally known icon.

Look at Adventure Time and the Popularity of Fiona and Cake.  Why is it popular?

I'd argue that it'd be a landmark decision in the industry, however minor and immaterial people may feel.

However, I think it would also really tick off a lot of fans... which is very sad."
74327,"I did watch the video, many times in fact, including looping particular sections.

I'm going to disagree with you on this topic."
74926,"This argument is almost the same exact argument that people who are fans of Dr. Who were having about the potential of the doctor being reincarnated female.

Just like that, the fandom seems split.  I can't really side with feminism on most things, but in THIS particular thing, I think it would be a great boon for a main character, who has previously been ostensibly male but doesn't HAVE to be, is female in an incarnation.

I think it would rock hardcore to have a female link."
76254,"You're being sexist because your essential argument is ""Just because I don't like it"".

You haven't made an argument about anything other than traditionalism, and your argument essentially is ""Link must always be male, because that's the way he has always been."""
78873,"The impact to gaming that Link being female would have is far different than the non-impact that following an already female character would have.

Breaking with traditions, as indicated in the opening to the video, in more ways than simply an open world.

While I agree it would be interesting to play as Zelda or Impa, this character doesn't really resemble either."
79473,"All change is principally for the sake of change.  There are other benefits other than just changing, it would appeal to a larger audience than just the Zelda fans, it would create an interesting dichotomy if they did NOT change Zelda's gender (Female Link and Female Zelda)."
80892,"Actually, no... if they wanted to boost sales of the game, they'd do something avant garde and controversial.  Something that would get people talking and buzzing about decisions.

Like open world.  Like a female Link.  Sure, it might piss off fans... but it would also bring in a bunch of people and it would create discussion, which again boosts the visibility of the game to the public awareness."
81500,"Eyelashes? Seriously, Eyelashes are't exactly the defining anatomy of a woman or girl.

I look at all the physical and noticeable qualities.  The shape of the legs, the width of the hips and the curvature of hips versus the width of hip to waist ratio, the broadness of the shoulders (Links shoulders in previous games have been broad enough to be masculine, and his hip/waist ratio have been masculine and his legs have been masculinely shaped).

Eyelashes aren't something I'd judge gender on.  Eyebrows, though, would be... and this particular characters eyebrows are thin, like a womans.  Previous Links have had eyebrows that were larger.  Not bushy, per se, but masculine."
82176,The kind of fan that hinges their fandom upon the gender of the main character is perhaps the kind of fan that the fandom doesn't need.
82785,"Are we referring to Dante from DMC? Because that particular fandom is way smaller than Zelda, and way younger, and I'm not surprised changing it at this point caused some dissatisfaction.

Of course, there may have been other reasons the reboot failed.  Probably several that had nothing to do with the character change."
83388,"I think you're confused.  Where did I say that the still images I linked were authentic? 

I'm well aware that still images can be shopped... Which is why I said ""I can post still images too"".

My determination as to the femaleness of the character isn't based on the still images, they're based on frames from the original video."
84423,$10 it's Link and a girl.
85854,"It was in rebuttal of someone posting a still image and saying ""See? Male"".

If you look at the rest of this thread, you will see where I specify the specific time stamps for the video that indicate the female gender of the protagonist in the video, whether Link or some other girl."
88740,"And what you don't seem to be understanding is that I wasn't using it as evidence, I was using it as a rebuttal.

In regards to the comparison image of the shopped and unshopped versions, you'll notice in both versions that Link's chest follows a curvature and overlaps the chest strap for the leather across their chest.

Booooob."
94545,"Wow, your reading comprehension needs some work.

I said that I'd watched the video multiple times.  Then I said that I was going to disagree with you on the subject of this thread; that Link in this video is male.

Also, I'm going to go ahead and ignore your request and do whatever I feel like, because this is the internet, and what are you going to do about it?

You ordering me to not do something is stupid.  Mostly because I was not ""Misleading"" people in this conversation thread.

Get over yourself.  I'm going to continue disagreeing with you as to the gender of the person in the reveal video, because you really seem to be of the same sort who just want it to be a male link for reasons unnamed and unsubstantiated."
137484,"I've seen two articles on this, both do indeed verify it is link.  However, the non-femaleness of the character is ambiguous, as nowhere does he actually say not female.

He does, however, say not to get hung up on how the character looks.

So I think the answer is still ambiguous, but this is indeed link."
142094,"Let's be clear; the other articles said that the character in the video wasn't Link based off of Aonuma saying ""No one explicitly said this was Link"".  They were wrong, as Aonuma turned around and is now saying it was in fact Link.

NOW the articles are claiming that Aonuma said that the character wasn't female.  Which is nowhere in anything they quoted.

Considering they were wrong the first time, I think I'm going to wait for more information before deciding that I'm wrong."
