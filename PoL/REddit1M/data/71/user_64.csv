33390,"Well, considering official lore, Zelda and Link had to have kids in every iteration of the game for there to be a new Zelda every time.

~~Although I agree with you that, if the trailer doesn't show Link, at least it has to be a blood relative. The optical similarities are too strong.~~ 
EDIT: I still believe it's Link!"
45427,"You're right, Link is obviously not necessary for Zelda to have children. What I meant was that every iteration of the game pretty much implies who the father of Zelda's kids is going to be ;) - at least at times when there is need for a new Link to appear (every game) and meet Zelda (almost every game).

There will obviously be a lot of generations where the father of the next child with Hylia's blood (=Zelda) does not have the soul of the hero (=Link).

Nontheless, as established by SS and HH, a Zelda game with Ganon obviously needs a descendant of Zelda and ""some random dude"" *with the soul of the hero*.

You can pretty much disregard the latter half of my previous comment. I don't think what I was trying to convey came out clearly.
Suffice to say this: The person in the trailer probably has the soul of the hero and (no matter the sex) will therefor be (that generation's) Link."
