7178,"But what about the hero from TMC's back story? He looked a lot like Link. What about the hero from FS's back story? What about the hero and princess from ALBW's back story?

These are all characters that we've never met despite them having very Link and Zelda-esque physical similarities."
7292,"Link carried the Triforce of Wisdom in the original game and its sequel. The King of Hyrule carried a larger portion of the Triforce of Wisdom for the majority of TWW than Zelda did.

Zelda isn't always the sole carrier of the Triforce of Wisdom."
7755,"And before it belonged to Tetra, it belonged to Tetra's mother, who wasn't a Zelda."
7866,"TMC's back story Link didn't wear a cap and was a child. SS Link did wear a hat and was an adult. So they can't be the same guy.

It's already confirmed that FS's back story's hero is a hero we've never met (Hyrule Historia, etc.).

ALBW's back story's hero can't be the Hero of Time unless the Oracles games have been retconned out of existence, so that one doesn't work either."
10609,"I think you're misunderstanding me because Hyrule Historia has nothing to do with what I'm talking about (since it doesn't mention ALBW).

If ALBW's back story is a retelling of OoT's story, then that means the Oracles games no longer happened because the Oracles games can only happen if Ganon died prior to them happening. But if ALBW's back story is the events of OoT (and then ALttP), then that means the Oracles can't have happened since ALBW tells us that Ganon was sealed away during ALBW's back story, and he remained sealed away until the events of ALBW. If the Oracles still happened, that would mean that Ganon would have had to have died in ALttP (or after ALttP), and therefore ALBW Ganon would have to be a different Ganon that was sealed away.

Plus there's all sorts of discrepancies between ALBW's back story and ALttP/ALttP's back story like Zelda being a sage/descendant of the sages in OoT/ALttP but not in ALBW's back story, etc. ALBW's back story has to be a brand new event."
11886,"There is no evidence of legends in the Zelda series ever being anything other than entirely accurate portrayals of history. Any time a legend can be confirmed or debunked as just some made up story, it is always confirmed.

But even still, we see in Oracles that Ganon was dead. We see in ALBW that Ganon is alive and has been that way since he was sealed away in ALBW's back story. ALBW's back story has to be a new event unless the Oracles didn't happen."
59844,"That tradition didn't start until AoL's back story, which took place a few generations before the events of LoZ.

Tetra's mother *could* have been named Zelda, but the mandate that forces all female Royal Family members to be named Zelda had not yet happened then. So it could go either way."
