3032,"It was clearly slated to look like Link. His normal people clothes (WW style), his general hairstyle of the 3D games since Twilight Princess (just with a pony tail and slightly longer side thingies). I'm pretty sure it's Link. If not you're looking at twins or kids or older brothers or younger brothers or something. "
3968,"Aonuma loves kinda playing with the fans like this, as we saw a lot of with ALBW, and then in ALBW with MM references. I have a feeling he's doing this just to enlighten discussion and keep the hype train going. We'll see the green tunic eventually. There's some conventions of Zelda you can't change. "
11763,"Yeah, slightly longer. Didn't really matter though because a) it was 2d and b) the front was longer so it was balanced better. I'm sure it's Link to. "
