5417,"You have to remember that there are a lot of Links. The Link in, say, Twilight Princess is not the same link in Skyward Sword. There is a thread connecting them but they are different people. 

With that in mind (suppose being the hero is a familial thing) there is no reason to imagine that link has to be male. It would make sense, even stand to reason, that some Links were girls.

All that noted, this is a game mostly played by teenage boys. Part the enjoyment of the game is empathizing with the main character. Making a teenage girl link is going to be a bad move money wise and at the end of the day the real plot of zelda is collecting rupees."
6473,"That's hubris. You don't know you've played all the links. You might have played all the Links and seen all the Zeldas up until a certain point but  every link, every Zelda has not been seen to my knowledge. "
6916,"For now. The book is definitive for now. This will change  down the road, and there will be a new definitive book. People will complain a bunch and so forth. 

As long  as Zelda games are popular/profitable you've never met all of the characters. 

Who is the last Link by the way? Why is there a last Link?"
8013,"You know as well as I do the biggest metroid surprise was when SAmus  turned out to be a girl. 

Also I am not saying that people can't relate to a female character, it is just harder to pull that off if you are a developer. 


As for the  game selling on name alone, yeah that happens. But it is a franchise, a low selling game now impacts the next game and so on. 

Off hand I don't have a source that says Zelda is mostly played by teenage boys. I don't have a source that teenage boys call each other ""faggots"" on call of duty either. I don't think I am making an extra ordinary claim here so I think the burden of  proof is  on you. I think the implication is that Zelda is not being marketed to teenage boys? That Nintendo doesn't want to make money?

92595,"&gt;It's not harder to make a good female character. If developers can make good male characters, they are just as capable of making good female ones. They just need to try more often and not focus on the fact that the character they're designing is female. Look at Midna, for instance. They didn't focus on her gender at all; they just made her a great character in general.

First off, it is hard to make a relatable character of any gender, species, what have you. Making a relatable character is hard. The easiest character to make is one that is close to you. You'll often hear actors say the same thing and you'll also often hear wrestlers say their in ring personas are amplifications of their actual personality. Now if you visit your local game making place the majority are guys and since they aren't all super creative if they are making characters the characters are going to be boys. Most of those characters will fail anyway but the easiest character to make for a guy is a guy. 

I would tend to concur that first you make a great character and then you worry about the specifics. But here you cite Midna as a good example of a character where they didn't focus on her gender and I think that is a mistaken notion. She's the twilight princess, beaten by an evil man and robbed of her beauty. That sounds pretty feminine to me. Would you like the story as much if it were Middude the Twilight Prince? ""Those bastards took my handsomeness!""

Maybe midna is not the best example. A better question is would link being a girl change anything at all? Not really since it's not like he ever ends up with Zelda. A key part of the Zelda franchise is putting yourself in links shoes so I think choosing links gender might be an interesting idea. 

&gt;I don't see why a Zelda game with a female protagonist would automatically sell less. Zelda's name is in the series' title, yet people didn't refuse to buy the games because of the name. Also, people were ecstatic when Impa, Zelda, and Midna were revealed as playable characters in Hyrule Warriors. Many female Zelda characters are very popular.

I hope that you're right, I hope that a game with a female hero wouldn't automatically sell less. And I think that you could argue that Tomb Raider and Laura Craft lends credence to this idea. That said cast your mind back, if you are old enough, to these days when 8 bit games ruled the world. There was no discernible way to tell a girl from a boy (Custer's Revenge is a notable exception)  and all the characters were. 

&gt;It's fine if you don't have a source, but you should avoid representing your statement as a fact if you can't prove its veracity.

Have you not used the internet before? Is this your first time on reddit? That said, you are kinda right.

&gt; It's fine if you don't have a source, but you should avoid representing your statement as a fact if you can't prove its veracity.

The problem here is that I like to have sources and my source was basically hearing my kid and the neighbor kid discuss Zelda games forever on the way to and from Splash country. That's not a good source but I haven't been able to find a decent citable source. My inclination is to guess that Zelda games are overwhelmingly played by guys but I can't be positive. I've met a lot of girls who really like the Zelda series but I've met many more guys. 

I wish there were more games with a female hero. I suspect people project their own personality on the characters they play. If you asked fifty guys what gender Yoshi is 49 guys would say ""male"" but Yoshi lays eggs. So that is inexplicable. 

Pardon that tangent.I generally agree with you,it wouldn't really matter if link were a girl and, in general, it wouldn't really matter is any particular game had a female hero. But I 'm jaded, I think default male protaganists are here from awhile longer. Just cause of money. "
356836,"&gt; Agreed, though I didn't intend to imply that it wasn't hard to make a relatable character; I meant that it wasn't necessarily always harder to make a relatable female character than a male one. There's still an unfortunate assumption in the media that girls can relate to both boys and girls while boys can only relate to boys, hence this perpetuation that male is seen as the ""default."" Despite this, boys actually do enjoy female-led media. For example, shows like The Last Airbender: The Legend of Korra (which stars a teenaged female character), Sofia the First (which is led by a young princess), and Doc McStuffins (which has a young black girl as its main character) actually have a very large segment of male fans. There's also the ""Brony"" phenomenon with the reboot of My Little Pony.

I'll agree that boys don't really care about the gender of the character nearly as much as people think they do. Boys, girls etc mostly care about gameplay and how good a story is. My kid would love link just as much if link were a girl. Which makes me wonder why there is so much interest in links gender. He loves Powerpuff Girls like every single person alive should.  We'll leave my little pony out of this cause some things...

&gt; True, but not everyone is like me. Someone may only relate to me in some ways but not others. A relatable character doesn't have to be exactly like me in order for me to relate to them to some degree. Actually, some of my favorite characters aren't even ones I relate to much at all! I think making likeable characters is just as important as making relatable ones.

You are exactly right but you are coming from the perspective of the consumer. As a consumer I loved Hannibal in Silence of the Lambs, as a creator there is no way I could've come up with that character. Chianti and fava beans? I'll tell you what goes with fava beans, skipping dinner. Beans suck. 

If you are creating characters you, of course, generally side with the easy/lazy way. If you are creating a game that probably means... well you get the idea. It would be fantastic if there was a little more diversity in games. 

&gt;Fortunately, things do seem to be gradually improving, which gives me hope. :)

I hope for better games, better stories and better gameplay when I think of the Zelda series. I don't think I necessarily hope for more female heroes in games to drive society towards a more equitable situation because I am not sure that video games are what drives that particular bus. I think games are a pretty bad reflection of the a guy always saving the day. 

I think you are exactly right when you point out that a male lead is an artificial construct that is not necessary. I'll be happy when it doesn't matter in the game because that will be a good indicator that it is not a big deal in the wider world. 

I hink that is all I've got to say about that. Thanks for the conversation, you win several secret prizes. best reddit conversation, most even headed redditor, least likely to call me a ... and so forth. Sadly, the prizes are worth absolutely nothing. "
