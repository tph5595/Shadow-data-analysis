7199,"What page does it say that on? That seems like a pretty dumb thing for them to say. If we've already played all the Links and seen all the Zeldas, that would mean that any and all future Zelda titles would need to be sequels to past games, locking Nintendo into and awkward and completely unnecessary situation. "

I think it's also very possible, and much more likely, that we are going to witness Link grow again, and that what we were shown was a younger, possibly Gerudo (someone pointed out the bracers look Gerudo) version of the character we will ultimately play."

American teenage boys anyway, I suppose there could be a difference in perspective there. All the Zelda players I've met have been females or adult males. The other group I would assume they're are marketing to are older children. Teenage boys seem to want more bloody, GTA, COD type games more than any other market. That's just the way it seems to me anyway."
47209,You're definitely right there. He's certainly not biologically Gerduo. Link is rarely raised by family though. It will be interesting to see if it means anything at all.
