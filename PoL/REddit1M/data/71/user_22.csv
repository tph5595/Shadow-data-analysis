7326,"&gt; even more stupid that her champion will be female

Why would a champion being female be _more stupid_ than a _goddess_ being male?"
7445,"Yeah, I can't see Nintendo saying ""Oh shit, we can't make this new Zelda game because Hyrule Historia tells us it will break the canon, which has been _sooooo_ important to us so far."""
7640,"I really wouldn't describe _whoever_ was shown in the trailer to be feminine so much as I would describe him/her to be very androgynous looking.  I mean, the pony tail is ambiguous, but there is absolutely no definition in the chest.  It looks like the character might have slightly feminine hips, but that could be an illusion from angles and clothing as well."
7754,"But Link is just the human incarnation of the hero's spirit, so why would that _have_ to be exclusive to one gender?  Are you maybe uncomfortable with an incarnation of Link being female, and thus projecting that discomfort onto your logic?"
8039,"A choice?  What are you talking about?  He doesn't have a choice in any of it.  Link's consciousness does not transcend each mortal incarnation, so it's very plausible to suggest that the goddess Hylia or the three goddesses are responsible for creating each incarnation, and thus they can choose as they please."
8992,"It's not about _his_ having a choice or not, it's about the choice of the _goddess_ deciding to reincarnate the hero as a female.  Unless you think that a ""soul"" is male or female."
