Only flat-chested females in TLOZ are female children or Zelda as Shiek, and I hiiiiiighly doubt Zelda was traveling as Sheik during this trailer. I mean, this is Nintendo's game, so they can change the story as much as they want at their own will, but this isn't a female. Lashes aren't big enough too. We all know Japan is fond of tits, they would not miss their chance on giving boobs to this character had it been adult Zelda."

Who cares if your lashes are bigger than your female friends? This is a video game, and most female characters have really large lashes in the Zelda series.

Don't know how that's racism, I've played enough JRPG games and watched enough anime."
