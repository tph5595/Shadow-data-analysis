7823,"Maybe there's some minor character creation? Ear length/shape. Hair styles/color. General face options. etc.

The idea doesn't bother me. I mean the game lets us choose our own name everytime (anyone who doesn't take Link is just wrong but that's another story)

As stories are retold, details can often be left out, or over exaggerated. I see no reason why Link, or rather ""The Hero"" should remain the same cookie cutter again after again. If character creation is implemented there are bound to be more than a few ""classic Link"" options to pick that you could just play the game without giving it a thought."
