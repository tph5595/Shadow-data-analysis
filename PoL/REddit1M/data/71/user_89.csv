EDIT: I'm calling it now, you start the game out playing as Ganondorf before he becomes corrupt. Then later on the game shifts focus to Link, who is summoned to Hyrule castle with a warning that a great evil is about to befall the land. Because you spend so much time playing as Ganondorf in the beginning of the game, it'll make the final battle so much more dynamic because the player will feel more connected to Ganon then they have in past games. 

Also I bet this game is going to take place between SS and OoT, I wouldn't be surprised if they included fast travel where a Skywing swoops in and takes you where you want to go."
