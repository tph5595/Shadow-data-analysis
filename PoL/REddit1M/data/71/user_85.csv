49147,"Id rather get a cool new female character then going ""Look Link is a girl"" what benefit is there changing a characters gender over making a new one? If anything to me it lessens the character like oh sure shes female but she is Link aka a guy in a womans body so shes strong. To hell with that give me a female who is strong on her own,  give Zelda the ability to fight or create someone new.

That'd be like making Samus a man because she hasn't been a man before. She is a damn badass and there is no reason people shouldn't be comfortable playing her."

74405,"There is a reason Link has returned again and again with his signature Green Tunic and various shades of Blonde hair. It's who he is, just as Mario retains his overalls, hate, and mustache. You can call a character whatever you want but if a character looks or acts differently from what you expect the new character doesnt seem quite right. Where are all the calls for a female Mario or a Duchess Nukem? Changing Link to a female doesn't do anything for the character, in fact in my opinion it feels like a lame attempt at pandering. There is so much more potential in creating new characters or fleshing out other female characters from the series, why would you want to change an exisiting one instead?"
74652,"Exactly, we could get a new kind of game in an IP we all love."
92394,"I'm not saying what Nintendo can or cannot do I just highly doubt they would make a female link when even through his changes he has stayed fairly consistent (light hair, green tunic, brave, sleeps in, selfless yet easily irritated). The biggest thing though is that instead of changing Link into a girl for the sake of having a girl main character why not make a game focusing on an already existing female character like Zelda or a new character in the Zelda franchise? It'd make for a more substantial *and interesting* change than just ""by the way Link is a girl.....carry on""."
