You can watch the video yourself if you want and compare them, but there's no denying that someone added both boobs and eyelashes to the character..."
80785,"How can you not see that there are NO eyelashes on him whatsoever in the video? I can maybe see how you get confused about the chest... maybe... but seriously, pause any frame in any official video, look at the eyes, and you'll see 100% that there are no eyelashes"
81688,"Hm? I'm talking about how the pictures you posted where Link looks like a girl are photoshopped. In your pictures, eyelashes were added. Multiple black eyelashes on the top corners of his eyes and on the bottom. If you look at my picture or at ANY frame in ANY video of the E3 presentation that shows Link you can clearly see that Link has NO eyelashes in the video. Therefore, the picture with eyelashes and boobs is fake."
85115,"What? So you're just posting images that you know are photoshopped just to confuse people...?
edit: I see you also used them in another comment as ""proof"" that Link is female"
85964,"The one I see is replying to someone talking about hair color. The point is that if you know an image is photoshopped, you shouldn't be spreading it and using it as evidence "
92850,"Saying ""Female because..."" and then posting a photoshopped picture of Link with added eyelashes and added boobs, when they are clearly fake, is simply a lie... I don't care if you call it 'evidence' or a 'rebuttal', you're just plain lying. 

And about the strap, no. Pull a strap tightly across your chest and shirt and it will pull underneath your shirt and indent your skin. Watching the video makes it clear that there is no boobs. You can also tell because the outside line of the shirt stays consistent above and below the strap. If your saying their are boobs there, then the shirt fabric on top would stick out more.

The fact is that the images are fake. Stop using them as evidence or as a 'rebuttal'. They're completely photoshopped and you're misleading people. 

Edit: And you did claim that they were authentic, because when I told you that the pictures were photoshopped you said you disagree with me."
95034,"The 'topic' I was talking about was that the pictures were photoshopped. You said you disagreed with what I said. I never said Link was male, I said the pictures were photoshopped. Don't tell me my reading comprehension needs work when neither of us mentioned Link being male.

I don't care if you think Link is female. I still think Link could be female, and I wouldn't care all that much. All I'm saying is that the photo's you posted were completely fake and had eyelashes and breasts added where there are none."
136830,"Well, Chainedfei, it looks like you were proved completely wrong. Your images were photoshopped, Aonumas comment WAS INDEED just a joke, and Link is confirmed to be a male. Nice try with being a complete jerk with your argument though."
