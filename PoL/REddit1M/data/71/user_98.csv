59330,"[Last year, I said that revisiting the conventions of the zelda series would be our theme for the new zelda game for  wii u](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XZmxvig1dXE)

First thing he says. 

Also, your argument only works for samus because literally every metroid game has the exact same samus. She's the same person. No alternate timelines or reincarnations. 

All of the princess zelda's of the series are direct descendants. Blood descendants. 

Meanwhile, every link is a different person. There is a chance some may be family, but it's uncommon. Skyward sword canon says that the godess picks agents to protect zelda and ensure the legend makes its logical end, and if you don't recall, impa was one of those agents. 

Some links aren't even the same legend. Twilight princess link is another incarnation of the hero of time, while wind waker link is not, he is the hero of the winds. 

There are a million reasons the person in the trailer, or the hero of the game could potentially be female. Anything can happen in the zelda lore and there is MUCH to be explored, if majora's mask wasn't any indication. 

Finally, coming from a guy so you don't make any stupid assumptions, male representation in gaming is far different than female representation. 

Making samus a man would be bad because it would alter one of the VERY FEW prominent female protagonists gaming has, which would be a shame, considering how much damage Other M already did to her. A LARGE MAJORITY of gaming's protags are male, and no more obscure female protags don't count because they don't influence perception and representation as much as prominent ones. I love jade, but beyond good and evil is simply not popular enough to be used as a counter argument. 

Meanwhile, having ""link"" be female for one go would at the best add another good female protagonist to the gaming world, in an extremely popular game series. Male representation would take 0 damage as it already dominates the gaming scene hands down, and the worst that would happen would be some pissed off fans. 

Or I could just take the angry sexist turbonerd side of the argument and decided that decent representation should take a backseat to how ""iconic"" a character is. FALSE EQUIVALENCE HO!"
59501,"If it was absolutely link, I hightly doubt they would claim it might not be link. 

This whole debate happened with nintendo teasing sylveon's type. Everyone said it must be an already established type and that there was NO WAY they would add a new type.

And to no one's surprise, they were entirely wrong, and sylveon was the first pokemon revealed of a new type."
59607,"&gt;Only flat-chested females in TLOZ are female children or Zelda as Shiek

Ah yes, new characters are impossible.

&gt;but this isn't a female. Lashes aren't big enough too.

I'm a guy and my lashes are bigger than 95% of my female friends'. Tons of girls have different lash sizes, and as it turns out ya can remove em too. Big surprise.

&gt;We all know Japan is fond of tits, they would not miss their chance on giving boobs to this character had it been adult Zelda.

Had to throw in the bonus racism eh?"
59785,"&gt; Link was always supposed to be the player, after all.

That got debunked as soon as wind waker came out. Ever since that game, link has had an individual personality and more fleshed out personal life. Link is a character on his own now, no longer a projection for the player. 

I love the idea of customization, I just don't agree that link is a ""blank slate"" character."
59993,"* Zelda's hair was never any of the new shades it was until the game they were featured in. 

* ganon's trademark weapon was his wizardry until wind waker. They can change weapons.

* Zelda would need a sword if she were to go on this kind of adventure, so why wouldn't she take one? Also the first weapon myster y character draws against the enemy is a bow."
61250,"&gt;Don't know how that's racism, I've played enough JRPG games and watched enough anime.

That's racist in literally the same way your previous comment was.  A sweeping generalization about an entire country you've based on the media you consume. Pretty textbook racism."
61431,"The protagonist is the main character of a game.

If the subject was whether or not impa would be the main character of a zelda, I would absolutely agree that the game should happen. Impa is an amazing character, and her lore and character deserves exploration.

But to put it bluntly, we're not talking about impa here. We're talking about ""link"""
62373,Wrong. Plenty of women have a near zero bust.
62789,"&gt;Everything is subject to change

&gt;They won't just change an iconic characters gender for the story,

I see you're in the habit of contradicting yourself in the same thread"
62845,I know tons of females with almost completely flat chests. Or I guess they just don't exist according to you.
79169,"&gt;So if he has a flat chest... that automatically means he's a flat chested girl, not a guy?

I'd like you to screenshot where I said that. 

Too bad you can't."

79272,"Ah classic reddit.

Don't like racism? You're too sensitive. 

But remember, this is a site with super progressive intellectuals!!!/s"
80019,"They have a million ways to get people to talk about a new zelda game that aren't a bait and switch. 

Examples:

* Introduce a new zelda game

Even with trickle updates the nintendo fanbase would talk and speculate on the game all the way up until release. Nintendo needs literally no help in the hype department, they have it covered. 

But when they specifically comment on a very particular aspect of a trailer or teaser, that means they have something in the works.

Aonuma has even commented saying that a new zelda game doesn't have to have zelda as a princess, or even have link and zelda in the game as characters, considering the amount of lore they have to expand on. 

Hell, the only consistent character MM had was link. No zelda, no dorf, no major story elements related to the ACTUAL legend of zelda. Sure link was still there, but it's proof that they're willing and able to expand or alter their strategy."
