32002,...So far.  There's nothing saying another can't come around lol.
32321,"Throwing around a photoshopped image to try and prove a false point... what even *is* the point after all that?

Why do people want Link to be a girl so badly?  What's the point?"
32403,"The real point is that there's nothing to suggest it's a woman, other than Link being androgynous... as he *always* is.  It's the point of his character.

Look at [this image](https://i.imgur.com/6Al6ESW.jpg) and point out the part that suggests, in any way, that he's likely to be female.  There are none."
33729,"[Perfect quality, all details perfectly visible](http://filemanager.linkshideaway.com/staff_files/autydi/WiiU_TheLegendofZelda/t/WiiU_Zelda_scrn02_E3.png)

So where's the chest?  And how in the world can you imagine [those hands](http://thekoalition.com/images/2014/06/zelda2015.png?162ffd) belong to a girl?

Whoever this character is, it's obviously a guy.  He's hardly any more androgynous than any other Link, and there are little to no features that can be attributed to being female other than the fact that Link has, and has always had, a pretty face."
34269,"You're getting downvoted because some very strangely butthurt Zelda fans *really* want this to be strictly a girl or Zelda or something... but I can damn-near guarantee that what you said is true.

They're doing the modern open-world RPG thing, and character customization is part of that.  Link was *always* supposed to be the player, after all.  That's why you can name him whatever you want.  Now, they're taking it a step further."
34859,"It's because for a split second during the blurry trailer, he looked extra feminine.  Upon examination of the high-quality screenshots, he does not.  He's got pretty much the exact same body shape as TP Link, aside from his larger, cartoonier head.

There's also a photoshopped picture being spread around trying to prove the point that he's a girl... which *actually* proves the point that he isn't, because you have to use photoshop to make it seem plausible.  Dudes a dude, and I bet you 20 bucks that what Aonuma is hinting at here is the ability to customize your own character, which is a staple in open-world games like this."
53733,"...My Link is from Nintendo's official site, go check.  The one you just posted *is* photoshopped lol.  He's got shopped eyelashes, and the chest is *obviously* stretched. [This](http://gamer-network.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/the-legend-of-zelda.png) is the real one.

You can post split-second shots as examples from a blurry video and shops all day long, but the HQ picture negates it all.  The features you claim make him so feminine do not exist when you *can actually see* with any detail.

&gt;note how the chest folders OVER the leather strap.

What you're seeing is the belt clipping through his body when he bends."
58019,"My refutation is that the video is blurry and you barely see Link for more than three seconds, and when you do, it's a moving, explosion filled, hard-to-see couple frames.

The official pictures released *are not* hard to see.  They very clearly show whats going on, and from it, you can see that what you claim isn't the case.  His body is almost exactly the same as TP/SS Link's.

You're the one who refuses to be reasoned with.  You're holding on a few blurry seconds of video of an awkwardly posed Link as if it's something definitive, and disregarding the much-more definitive HQ screenshot from Nintendo.  You also tried to use a known 'shop to prove the point... which actually proves the point that he's actually a male, simply because he needs to be photoshopped for the whole ""female theory"" to be believable.  If he *was* a girl, he'd look like that photoshop... but he doesn't.

Guarantee you that this is all going to come down to character customization."
58719,"...Wait, you're actually denying that it's shopped?

Well then let me put it to rest for you:

[This](http://i.imgur.com/JJa5gSx.jpg) is what you posted.

Notice the eyelashes, and obvious boobs, right?  Now anyone who has used photoshop could tell that they *are* photoshopped, but since you don't believe me...

[This](http://gamer-network.fr/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/the-legend-of-zelda.png) is the *real*, non-shopped version of the picture you posted.  No (excessive) eyelashes, no boobs.  Yours is shopped.  If you can't pick up on those obvious details... I'd have to say you should probably pay closer attention before making such confident claims, or you're simply ignoring these details for the sake of what you *hope* to be the case."
59263,"There *is* no better quality video.  The only true-quality images come from the official Nintendo site, which I showed you, which show none of these feminine details.

&gt;why are you so butthurt that this link may be a girl?

I'm not.  I'm *almost* positive that this game will let you customize Link, and choose your gender, and I have no problem with that.  I have a problem with people acting so certain in something that has next to nothing to support it other than ""Link looks kinda girly.""  Yes, he always does.  That doesn't make him so certainly a girl like you seem to believe.

If there *was* anything legitimate to suggest that he was a girl, I'd be right there with you, and I wouldn't care... but there isn't."
60448,"He certainly has some degree of definition between his multiple iterations, but the same things that were true in the past are still true today.  He still only says what you tell him to say(in most situations), and his name is still your decision.

It's more that he *is* a vaguely defined person who you finish defining through your 'influence' as a player.  I think Nintendo is trying to expand a bit on that, here.  

Not that I'm saying you're wrong, or anything.  Link *never* was *only* who you are.  He's always been a courageous, righteous, kind person who does the right thing, regardless of the player, and in most modern games (mostly Wind Waker) he certainly has his own personality, though I feel its one that Nintendo feels most people would be able to relate to, to some degree.  So, not so much 'blank', as much as 'easily relatable and somewhat influence-able'."
62004,"&gt;Zelda where a preview made me think that the person being portrayed was a girl

The original video made me think that too, until I looked at the quality pictures.  So I can understand where you're coming from, but it was only for the split second that I originally saw it.  Looking at him now reminds me of Edward Elric more than anything else.

&gt;Which would seem strange in a Zelda Game

I agree, but Nintendo seems to be taking the whole Elder Scrolls open-world RPG approach to this game, and character customization is a staple of that type of game.  They also said they're 'rethinking the conventions', and that perfectly fits in with it.  It also makes more sense, from a business perspective, to let players choose, rather than alienating people who specifically want to play as either a male or female.  You want to play as a female, I personally don't care, and many want to play as boy Link as they always have.  It'd be most appealing to the largest amount of people if you could simply decide for yourself.  Wouldn't you be happier, if instead of being forced to play as a boy again, you could simply choose to be a girl?

&gt;Far and above more interesting than being able to customize your character.

Why?  What difference does it make if Link has male parts, or female parts?  It dictates nothing about the actual character, other than imaginary levels of testosterone.

To me, being female, or gender is general... is entirely irrelevant.  It truly changes nothing, unless they take a sexist approach and make the character stereotypically 'girly' and revolve elements around that.

That's why I think being able to pick your gender is so feasible.  It really doesn't matter whether Link(or whoever) is male or female.  It's purely aesthetic."
63280,"So if he has a flat chest... that automatically means he's a flat chested girl, not a guy?  What?  How does that make sense?

There is literally nothing in any of the quality pictures to suggest that he's a girl."
