49371,Link uses light arrows as well...
50231,"I'm so glad that what's in this person's pants matters so much to everyone. No speculation as to what the game will play like, just whether or not it's a boy or girl. Good job, you sexist pricks. "
53257,"Oh, I'm sorry I didn't realize it was so important whether or not the main character has an extra item slot between their legs. "
61429,Nobody is retconning anything. 
61499,"It's not about whether or not it's bad or good, it's about why it matters. The Legend of Zelda has never been about Link's dick. "
62792,"It is a new protagonist, it's never been the same, except in Majoras Mask, it was the same protagonist as in Oot. 

The Link in Windwaker isn't the Link from A Link to the Past, and the Link in Twilight Princess isn't the Link in The Legend of Zelda. 

They are all different Links, just like Cid from FFVII isn't the same Cid from FFVI. Or how Jesus of the Bible isn't the same as Jesus, the guy who mows my lawn. 

Was there a scroll in one of the games that said ""the hero must have a penis?"" 

So what if it is a chick, it can still be Link. "
64180,"This is a new character, they aren't changing the gender. This Link could be (but likely isn't) female and they wouldn't be changing anything because Link gets reborn every so often. So what if he's born as a girl? If it can change his genes enough to change his hair color, then it can change his gender as well. "
64284,"Surely, you did not have a choice in what gender you were, but here you are, whatever gender you are. "
64853,"So then, there we have it, Link could be a girl because he has no choice in what he's born as. "
65239,"Ok, if that curse says he has to be genetically a certain way, how can it do things like, change his facial features, his hair color, and his eye color, but not the gender? You've got some mighty big holes in your argument. "
66543,"So, you're sexist and prejudiced, good to know. "
69367,I believe it. 
78511,"Link gets changed. That's why we have Toon Link, Adult Link, and Kid Link. Link is not wholly constant. Mario is constant, it's the same Mario from game to game. It is a different Link from game to game. Is reincarnation really that hard of an idea for you to grasp? 

I'm positive the Link in the video is male, but there's nothing holding Nintendo back from making a female Link. It's their game, it's their ip.  By their own rules, they aren't breaking anything by doing so.  A female Link could exist. But basically, Link is whatever Nintendo wants him to be, like it or not. "
