7274,"&gt; All that noted, this is a game mostly played by teenage boys. 

Do you happen to have a source for that? I'm just curious.

&gt;Part the enjoyment of the game is empathizing with the main character. Making a teenage girl link is going to be a bad move money wise and at the end of the day the real plot of zelda is collecting rupees.

The game would sell based on the name alone. Also, are you implying that boys and men can't relate to female characters? If that were the case, people wouldn't be clamoring for a new Metroid, and there wouldn't have been such a huge backlash against Samus' redesign in Other M."
7653,"If that's not Link, then one guess I have is that the character grows up as a different person and then learns that he's actually one of the reincarnations of Link (akin to how Ocarina of Time's Link grows up as a Kokiri and then learns that he's Hylian).

Or Aonuma could just be screwing around with us."
89466,"&gt;You know as well as I do the biggest metroid surprise was when SAmus turned out to be a girl. 

I asked about the Zelda fanbase's gender ratio, not Metroid's. Also, the original Metroid was released in 1986. It's 2014 now, so a female protagonist isn't as huge of a shock anymore (though they are still rather uncommon, unfortunately). For the record, I don't think the person we saw was a female character, but having a female Link or playing as Zelda would help the game garner a lot of attention and wouldn't necessarily cause the game to lose sales.

&gt;Also I am not saying that people can't relate to a female character, it is just harder to pull that off if you are a developer.

It's not harder to make a good female character. If developers can make good male characters, they are just as capable of making good female ones. They just need to try more often and not focus on the fact that the character they're designing is female. Look at Midna, for instance. They didn't focus on her gender at all; they just made her a great character in general.

&gt;As for the game selling on name alone, yeah that happens. But it is a franchise, a low selling game now impacts the next game and so on. 

I don't see why a Zelda game with a female protagonist would automatically sell less. Zelda's name is in the series' title, yet people didn't refuse to buy the games because of the name. Also, people were ecstatic when Impa, Zelda, and Midna were revealed as playable characters in Hyrule Warriors. Many female Zelda characters are very popular.

&gt;Off hand I don't have a source that says Zelda is mostly played by teenage boys. 

It's fine if you don't have a source, but you should avoid representing your statement as a fact if you can't prove its veracity.

&gt;I don't have a source that teenage boys call each other ""faggots"" on call of duty either. 

As with your Metroid analogy, that is completely irrelevant to the question I asked.

&gt;I don't think I am making an extra ordinary claim here so I think the burden of proof is on you.

You made the claim, so the burden of proof is actually on you. I never even implied that you were wrong, hence the reason I mentioned wanting a source out of mere curiosity. Why are you being defensive?"
354034,"&gt; First off, it is hard to make a relatable character of any gender, species, what have you.

Agreed, though I didn't intend to imply that it wasn't hard to make a relatable character; I meant that it wasn't necessarily always hard**er** to make a relatable female character than a male one. There's still an unfortunate assumption in the media that [girls can relate to both boys and girls while boys can only relate to boys](http://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/may/06/gender-imbalance-children-s-literature), hence this perpetuation that male is seen as the ""default."" Despite this, [boys actually do enjoy female-led media.](http://www.slate.com/articles/double_x/doublex/2013/09/clarissa_explains_it_all_the_legend_of_korra_and_doc_mcstuffins_show_that.single.html) For example, shows like The Last Airbender: The Legend of Korra (which stars a teenaged female character), Sofia the First (which is led by a young princess), and Doc McStuffins (which has a young black girl as its main character) actually have a very large segment of male fans. There's also [the ""Brony"" phenomenon with the reboot of My Little Pony](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Little_Pony:_Friendship_Is_Magic_fandom).

&gt;The easiest character to make is one that is close to you.

True, but not everyone is like me. Someone may only relate to me in some ways but not others. A relatable character doesn't have to be exactly like me in order for me to relate to them to some degree. Actually, some of my favorite characters aren't even ones I relate to much at all! I think making likeable characters is just as important as making relatable ones.

&gt;But here you cite Midna as a good example of a character where they didn't focus on her gender and I think that is a mistaken notion. She's the twilight princess, beaten by an evil man and robbed of her beauty. That sounds pretty feminine to me. Would you like the story as much if it were Middude the Twilight Prince? ""Those bastards took my handsomeness!""

To be honest, it's been a while since I've played Twilight Princess, though I don't explicitly recall the game's text mentioning her beauty being taken away. I just read an article about her to refresh my memory, and it just mentions her being cursed and turned into an imp who lacks her normal powers. She does say ""Am I so beautiful that you've no words left?"" at the end of the game, but I interpreted it as her being playful with Link when she sees that he's surprised by her transformation.

&gt;I wish there were more games with a female hero. I suspect people project their own personality on the characters they play. If you asked fifty guys what gender Yoshi is 49 guys would say ""male"" but Yoshi lays eggs. So that is inexplicable. 

Yoshi is a bit of an odd character in that sense. Of course, most Mario characters are rather strange in general! Yoshi (the main green one) is usually referred to with male pronouns, whereas Birdo is usually referred to with female pronouns. Perhaps they're counterparts, or maybe we've just never seen a Yoshi that is confirmed to be female yet.

&gt;But I 'm jaded, I think default male protaganists are here from awhile longer. Just cause of money. 

Fortunately, things do seem to be gradually improving, which gives me hope. :)"
430822,"&gt; I don't think I necessarily hope for more female heroes in games to drive society towards a more equitable situation because I am not sure that video games are what drives that particular bus. I think games are a pretty bad reflection of the a guy always saving the day.

I think video games, as a medium that's part of pop culture and becoming more ubiquitous, actually do have the ability to create change. As a form of artistic expression, they can help promote discussion and awareness about various topics. Of course, I'm not saying that video games alone can change our entire society, but they play a role in creating solutions.

&gt; I think you are exactly right when you point out that a male lead is an artificial construct that is not necessary. I'll be happy when it doesn't matter in the game because that will be a good indicator that it is not a big deal in the wider world.

Definitely. I look forward to better character and story development. Games have a ton of untapped potential.

&gt; I hink that is all I've got to say about that. Thanks for the conversation, you win several secret prizes. best reddit conversation, most even headed redditor, least likely to call me a ... and so forth. Sadly, the prizes are worth absolutely nothing.

[Aw, shucks.](https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/5413052160/hFC20D1BC/) Thanks to you, too, for being respectful and listening to my viewpoint. :) As for the prizes, they can still have sentimental value! :P"
