* Zelda's hair has never been this shade of blonde

* The protagonist's hair is styled like tp Link, the only difference being slightly longer hair and a relatively short ponytail

* The protagonist is wearing blue earrings. What character has worn blue earrings since Oot? Adult Link.

* Zelda's trademark weapon is the bow of light with light arrows (which all your screenshots of Zelda indicate), neither of which are seen in the trailer

* There is a sword on the horse if you pay attention. A weapon which Zelda has rarely used in combat"
