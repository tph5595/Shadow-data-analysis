7842,"Here's the thing that is getting me more riled up than I would usually be. When it comes to the crowd, like on Who Wants to be a Millionaire, they're usually right. Folks are sharp and pick up on subtle things easily. Nintendo is sharp and their art team have been continually stepping things up, and they know what they're doing.

I would be more excited if it were a female Link or Zelda than most probably, but that so many people are independently thinking this character looks more like a girl than any other Link to date is not to be ignored. Maybe they are just messing with us! But to be so coy about it, and show us a teaser for a Zelda game that features neither the green tunic/hat, nor the Master Sword is a pretty big deal!

So, I'm not saying it's Zelda, but it's Zelda."

My point about that though is more that this is the very first teaser for the new Zelda game, and the hero is neither in the iconic green tunic nor wielding the Mastersword. It's a very deliberate choice on their part to do that! Usually, and especially for the first thirty seconds we see of a game they would want to make it as instantly classic-Zelda as they could.

Like I said, it could just be playing coy and showing that they're looking to change things up a bit. Maybe like some others have said they'll include multiple clothes/armors or something. But it's just not inconsequential that the first we see of this hero isn't in green. (Has there ever been another first Zelda teaser trailer that didn't feature the green robes? Honest question.)"
