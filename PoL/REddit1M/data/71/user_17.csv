6820,"Yeah, I thought the general rule of the Legend is ""There will be a Hero with Courage, Royalty with Wisdom, and Evil with Power.""

I'm not sure genders are ever stated, though. "
8661,"I remember the legend from the bits and pieces from other games (I can't remember the end of SS very well), so it might be more specific at the end of SS.

Still, some people are pointing out the similarity of ""Link""'s clothing and Gerudo clothing. And the technology seen in Skyward Sword. Which means that the new game could take place before Skyward Sword, back before the technology on the surface was lost. 

Which would also mean that the Trinity-Hero-Royalty-Evil wouldn't exist yet. Perhaps SS-Link's ancestors would exist. But they wouldn't be bound by the Legend, since it hadn't been created yet. It would just be a normal ancestor. "
9383,"Definitely, I agree. Many people would say ""Before that point there was no Link or Zelda"". While that may be true in a ""legendary figures"" way, they had to come from somewhere. A game following a completely different story with a character being SS-Link's ancestor would be very different.

They've stated they want to do ""very different"". I just think it would be a good option if they wanted to escape the trinity formula. "
