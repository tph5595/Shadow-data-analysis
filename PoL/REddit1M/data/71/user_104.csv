88980,"links always been a pretty boy, but at the same time he's always looked undisputably male. i don't think it's any coincidence that Aonuma says he wants to shake up Zelda conventions, then shows a video of a protagonist that looks more feminine than any other incarnation of Link we've seen. if the link we've seen at e3 was supposed to be male, they would have made him look undisputably male as they have in the past. 

making him more effeminate, yet still male would serve no purpose, whereas changing his gender would ""shake up the conventions of the Zelda franchise"" like Aonuma wants."
