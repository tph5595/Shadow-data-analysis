14505,"Maybe things will be explained when an official title comes out....? I feel like they wouldn't change the hero of the game. They'd be changing the entire image of the Zelda games. I can't really imagine a Zelda game without Link in it. His features change in all the games, but maybe they wanted to be a little more dramatic this time with a whole new look? Or even....female Link????"
