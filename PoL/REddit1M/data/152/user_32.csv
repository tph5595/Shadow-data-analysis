82659,"I can't get over the feeling that this is set after Ganondorf is sealed before Wind Waker, and no one seems to think this.
(To me, it explains Kuroks, as they was already evolving, and Ganon escaping his prison, and the appearance of Darunia, where to me it could just be that the Sages have reawakened, including Zelda, and I thought it could be the events leading to the Great Flood)

Obviously, I am utterly incorrect, so may someone please explain why this most definitely is not the case as it now seems all but confirmed it's in the fallen timeline?
Much appreciated! ^^"
