5928,He is
6004,Fam i know first off Deku Tree knows him and 2nd Deku knew WW link too but DEKU in OOT knew Link as baby ! He raised him with fairies. There is deeper connection he in way is his step dad lol.
9868,Yeah I know I mean 1st and 2nd.
40584,"all downfall games have sword going thru the Z like in BOTW. The Deku tree remembers freaking link he did die but the sprout retained his memories. Now WW link knows Deku yadda yadda but not enough. WW much koroks not a big deal at all. Kokiri when they leave the forest they change forms. 

DEKU TREE gave the link a home and helped raise the young hero of time. So there is a bigger emotional draw with this. The game features a protag with amnesia or w/e. They did this because he is not a new link and need to hide who he is thinking about it. Its a total f***en cop out to make Deku say I know but your some other guy I met blah blah.

ON TP Castle town thing. 


Think about this in Back to the Future there are two 1985s for a time.

Say in 1985 a and b, I as person want to build my house in New Jersey.

Just because there is a timeline split does not mean I can exist in both timelines and want to do the same thing.

So its not far fetched after OOT castle was rekt, link was DEFEATED not killed. Link and Zelda, sages seal Gannon and remove his body making him calamity soon to be.

Time passes They build TP castle in the same time in the year or w/e. Then cutscene from trailer hit home. Gannon has now broken free link fails again hurting his left arm. They show his left arm all messed up in the trailer. Now he is right handed to confuse people on who he is :/ they are tricky people.

Link nearly or dies and is put in revival chamber for 100 years.

Now we also seen evidence of them being inspired by Ghibli and Mononoke. As***aka and Link look a like in this game. His arm in Mononoke was scarred from demon bla bla and if u pause trailer at here https://youtu.be/zw47_q9wbBE?t=193

Look around here his left arm is badly damaged.

Now for bird people they are too evovled on scale of Human ---- Bird By that I mean they are far more bird that Human.

I think it bait to trick you , some people think they can be race from Zelda 2. Many fans have not played Zelda 2 and I think they will add references to Z2 sinces its on same timeline. IMO WW and TP are debunked timelines. The biggest selling point is some guy I think was reddit he showed all downfall titles and they have SWORD down vertical on all titles just like BOTW. as well as OOT has sword point to the left diagonal which points to left timeline downfall lol. 

Now on added point Darunia and that goron in trailer seems to be same guy you see him breaking out of blue stuff maybe stasis chamber? 

Remember after in OOT the sage chamber was all blue like shiekah tech ?!

Zelda can easily be in stasis waiting for Link.

Oldman could be king from OOT we never see or get details from him.

Now some guy on yt found in Hyrule Historia it says Hero of Time will REPAPPEAR.

It also states during preq to ALTTP there is war to stop gannon and within ranks Link reappears one from OOT.


THIS is rough copy from my crappy gamefaqs post so bare with it."
40739,"&gt; st every single console game has involved some form of time travel. I'm pretty sure we may be doing more than just viewing flashbacks :P. Either way its unlikely this is a direct fallen timeline sequel to OoT, because the OoT itself should be theoretically present. Now that we know that the master sword is in the Lost Woods. There is a definitive reason why Nintendo decided to include a desolate ToT. I have a feeling if we mess around with it enough we might be able to time travel, who knows, maybe the essence of th

In Hyrule Historia it hints that OoT link will return again and help in that war."
41142,They are trees maybe the root of Deku old memories are in him.
41249,Revive could of made him younger like rejuvenated his skin etc. Plus they need to hide his identity so we guess lol.
41847,I could talk about this all day and by that I mean I want to so time passes and BOTW happens sooner lol.
42084,Nah man its more than likely that shiekah have multiple stasis chambers and Zelda was in it. I also think Darunia is there and in trailer it looks like he breaks out of it. Right here this https://youtu.be/zw47_q9wbBE?t=117 looks like a stasis pod its not anything like a shrine. https://youtu.be/zw47_q9wbBE?t=175 here is darunai now Idk his blue fire thing is odd.
43220,I am happy this thread exists and many are on right page with me. I started with OOT love all the games would love to see him again back as the hero.
80771,"https://youtu.be/H59M89AKefs?t=907 at 15:19 kindra says ""Oh no hero of time where are you going?"" She is localization editor for games and would know entire games story."
82002,"Playing oot again just now met zelda she said this :

""But suddenly,  a ray of light shot out of the forest, parted the clouds and lit up the ground..""
""The light turned into a figure holding a green adn shinign stone, followed by a fairy...""

""I know this is a prophecy that someone would come from the forest...""

""Yes I thought you might be the one..""

I am so fucken excited right now lol.
 Now
That must mean Link is ray of light and she says in botw be our light once more..."
100425,"someone on yt said with amensia if he has that it can be so bad that he forests he is left handed. As well as aonuma said right hand was gameplay issue.

Not to mention since TP link is considered amberdexterious from wii and gcn ver. Link OOT in MQ port is Right handed."
102616,Yeah its not strong point.
103133,41 or 42 days lost count
