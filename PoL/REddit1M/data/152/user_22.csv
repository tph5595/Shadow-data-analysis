36420,"Yeah, we aren't really sure how young Young Link was, but he seems to be somewhere around 7-12 years old. Adult Link is actually closer to a teenage Link, likely somewhere between 14-19 years old at most. 

I assume that at most, Young Link was only around 10 during OoT. Majora's Mask, despite using mostly the same models, seemed to imply that Link a young teenager, around 12-13 during those events, assuming that the Clock Town guards are to be believed. "
