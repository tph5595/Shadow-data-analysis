16005,"Yep. He was only in the sacred realm for 7 years, putting him in his teens as ""adult"" link."
16634,"That's been my theory for a long time. However, the recent evidence that I saw to support it was the Deku Tree talking to Link, and saying that he can tell that Link doesn't remember him.

Also: 

1) Link awakens in the shrine of resurrection, which implies that he dies (or was badly wounded) and it took 100 years to repair those wounds. Makes sense that the Link that was wounded was the one defeated by Ganon in OoT.

2) The Master Sword can be seen in front of the Deku tree in the same shot mentioned above. The sword was in the lost woods in all of the downfall games I've played (ALttP and the original LoZ come to mind. Not exactly in the woods in the original, but you need to go through the woods to get there.)

I'm sure there's much more, but I'm a bit brain dead right now and can't think."
17332,"To me it seems obvious that it is a Link that we've already played as, and OoT Link makes the most sense. 

We already know, from the official timeline, that he was defeated in one of the scenarios. It would make sense that after this defeat they put him in the Shrine of Resurrection because he is the hero of legend (was able to pull the sword and travel through time) and is still their best bet in defeating Ganon, even though he failed in this attempt.

Plus the Great Deku Tree recognizes him, which would make sense. Link talked to the Deku Tree sprout immediately after it popped out of the ground (and it somehow knew Link's back-story, even though it was seemingly just born. I always found that weird, but w/e) therefore Link and the Deku Tree definitely know each other, but Link has obviously lost his memory from being resurrected (which we know from many scenes.) It seems that Zelda was the one who returned the Master Sword, so she probably told the Deku Tree what had happened to Link (he was defeated) when she returned the sword (which can be seen beneath/in front of the Deku Tree in the latest trailer.)"
17765,"Sudden? 100 years has passed. He spent 100 years in the Shrine of Resurrection. I don't wear the same clothes that people wore in 1917.

Also, why would it need to be the same Zelda? It could very well be a different Zelda and the legend of the Hero of Time, who lies dormant in the Shrine of Resurrection, could have been passed down over time, as is the case with many stories in this series."
21751,It likely is. That doesn't change anything I wrote above.
84234,"Yes, after you finish the forest temple as adult link, the Deku Tree sprout pops up and talks to you."
84384,"That's the only thing I could come up with too. Maybe he sprouted up from an existing, and still alive, portion of the original Deku Tree? Plants can do crazy things like that."
85026,"Some more evidence: If you look at the official timeline in the Hyrule Historia, there is a **-** in the ""Hero is Defeated"" timeline **right after OoT**. 

There is a heading that says ""Hyrule's Decline &amp; The Last Hero"", then a dash, indicating that something goes there but we haven't seen it yet. On the other side of the dash, you see ""The Sealing War"". This description fits this game precisely. Hyrule declined, ""Calamity"" Ganon is on the loose, and we need to seal him in The Sealing War.
