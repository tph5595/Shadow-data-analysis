36027,"The backstory seems to heavily imply the fall hero timeline. As does the location of the Master Sword in the trailer which is the same location it's found and then replaced in AlttP (flowers and all). There's evidence that somewhat supports each timeline but I think slightly stronger evidence for the fallen timeline. And then there's more nuanced and implied things such as choice of wording from npcs and themes found throughout the game that, while less concrete, do lend support to the fallen timeline theory. 

The timeline is a tricky and fun thing to theorize about. No need to get your jimmies rustled. "
36322,It's entirely possible that the koroks are just a natural state the kokiri kids can take. Either when they need to or simply a later stage of their evolution. The kids exist in all three timelines right at the split. In the child timeline they don't matter so we don't see them again. Same for the fallen timeline.
