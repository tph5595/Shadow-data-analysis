19231,"To be honest, I'm more inclined to think it's in the Ganondorf sealed split of the timeline. 

I can't help but think that the tragedy of 100 years ago that Impa mentions is the flood. Not to mention the inclusion of all the Wind Waker-esque characters that are present. 

But I want to introduce a completely far-out thought which may prove not true at all. Zelda is seen in what looks like adventure gear. The only game where she goes on a journey is Wand of Gamelon. Now, those games are not canon, it's been stated that way. But Nintendo have the power to resend that statement if they saw fit. With a new President, comes new paths &amp; he might see fit to do just that. But that leaves a lot of holes since where do the characters fit in. If anything, it might be a nod. As Funhaus mentioned, a YouTube channel, Super Mario Odyssey has a nod to the movie since I believe the real world segment is New York, where they lived. 

I'm still leaning towards the flood, it would explain the rust on the sword as well. Given that it's 100 years in the future, who knows, Sheikah could have increased their presence while Link slept. 

Is Epona playable in the game? 

With horses having to be caught, tamed, then can be killed, it's hard to imagine Nintendo killing Epona. I know in the Wii U demo years ago at E3 2014 I think, it showed a horse but I can't recall if they said it was Epona, or just called it a horse &amp; we as fans thought Epona since it's the only horse Link ever rode. 

This could lend more fuel for the Wind Waker timeline since Epona is never mentioned in any of them. 

There's nods to various Zelda titles, the open-world could be linked (haha...) to the very first game since it was pretty open for its generation &amp; encouraged a player to explore. "
