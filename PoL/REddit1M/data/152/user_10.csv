15935,"It's not the fallen Link. 


Notice Zelda. Who is also still young like Link. I doubt Link died and she just didn't age for 100 years. They both could've been put in stasis / a resurrection chamber.  I bet you have to find her and wake her up. 

If it's going to be a previous Link, i'm hoping it's the same Link from ALtTP, the Oracle games, and LA. I don't think it is a Link we've seen before, though. 

I think it's a previous Link within the context of the story of Zelda, but not one we've seen. One we'll be introduced to through the story of BoTW. One who had his start a little over a hundred years ago. "

18842,No it doesn't. Resurrection doesnt have to mean from death. It could mean from a 100 year slumber.
