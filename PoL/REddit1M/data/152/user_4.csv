5065,"This is 1000% the fallen hero timeline, its pretty much been confirmed. The big question on everyone's mind that hasn't been answered is when BOTW actually takes place. Based on the fact we see the Temple of Time and the old man refer to it as such etc etc. I postulate that BOTW takes place sometime around OoT on the timeline. Frankly I think this game is closely related to OoT based on some of the things that Nintendo has included in this game. 
Edit: IIRC: I'm pretty sure the Temple of Time was only in OoT that is definitely not a mistake and worth noting. "
8751,"Also by the translation Zeltik did, which was on the official map for the game... lol "
9225,"Honestly though, when you consider the stretches Nintendo has made over the series to make connections its entirely possible. The big thing is, if he is indeed OoT link where the hell was all this mechanical beast crap back then. Honestly, this could be the end of the Fallen Hero timeline and a distant sequel to OoT. Look, if this is the Fallen Hero Timeline, which is not out of the realm of possibility, then the only flashbacks we would be witnessing is when the ""hero fell"" so that would imply Link losing. I personally think this is the end of the Fallen Hero Timeline. It would be pretty cool since SS was the first and now this could potentially be the ""last"" in this timeline"
10482,"I agree it is unlikely that this is a direct sequel to OoT, but was the ToT in any of the other games of the fallen timeline? "
11722,"Thats precisely my point. While all of the Zelda games are ""linked"" because of the developmental constraints some of the connections are hard to make. So I think what we've come down to is that this is definitely somewhere in the fallen hero timeline, (IMO the very end of the timeline, because now we are fighting and defeating gannon, instead of losing). Personally, I think the ToT has a very important significance in the game and am willing to guess that this might be early in the Fallen hero timeline (another branch perhaps.. lol) thats why I am thinking this is a close sequel to OoT. Edit: and by end of the timeline i mean because link wins, not because it follows all the games chronologically. "
13209,"yeah, i mean that could be a coincidence, but almost every single console game has involved some form of time travel. I'm pretty sure we may be doing more than just viewing flashbacks :P. Either way its unlikely this is a direct fallen timeline sequel to OoT, because the OoT itself should be theoretically present. Now that we know that the master sword is in the Lost Woods. There is a definitive reason why Nintendo decided to include a desolate ToT. I have a feeling if we mess around with it enough we might be able to time travel, who knows, maybe the essence of the game will be link going back in time to the fateful day he lost 100 years prior and win, we will know March 3rd! (I.e. he retrieves the fixed master sword and takes it back in time to kill ganon (maybe he inserts it into a secret pedestal in the ToT?? XD) "
33133,"So, I might be grasping at straws here but, OoT came out 19 years ago. The entirety of the Fallen Hero Timeline has played out over the handheld games and not one has been a console game. I am guessing that if Skyway Sword was the beginning of it all for this ""linear timeline"" then BoTW is a direct sequel to OoT, just so Nintendo can finally end one timeline. It could be a complete stretch, but the only other game time travel was emphasized in (not used, but like based on the actual story) was OoT. I think that is more than a coincidence. "
