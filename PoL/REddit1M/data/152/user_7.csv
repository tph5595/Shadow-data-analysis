7533,"His evidence is quite direct: Only *one* timeline has strong Sheikah presence.

It would also correlate with something else: The shrine of resurrection."
12564,"Actually no. Both are invalid -- Koroks are Kokiri who have evolved. Likewise, it's fair to say that no kokiri whatsoever has been spotted after OOT, because they hide themselves from the population. They are afraid of people and don't show their face unless necessary. The exception: WW, when link had to meet with the Deku Tree. It is said that the Kokiri evolved to survive the new watery landscape; however, their presence in BOTW contradicts this.

The gorons are present in most of the zelda games, *including* the fallen hero timeline.

Other timelines has some kind of sheikah presence, true. But here, we're speaking of a massive presence to seal ganon as he wasn't defeated by the hero. The wording is important: nowhere does it states that the princess and the hero are victorious. Likewise, sheikah presence is minimal in other timelines. The technology looks awfully like the one depicted on the TP enemies and several architectural structure. And we get to see a few Sheikah symbols in each console titles. On the other hand, you find many enemies from WW in BoTW. But you also see many others, too.

The reality is that as long that we do not know the official story, we can only guess. The map seems to indicate the fallen hero timeline.

It would also be great if you could not do strawman and have content to support an argument."
