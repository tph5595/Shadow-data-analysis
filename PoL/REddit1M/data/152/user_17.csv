22740,"I fully expect the old man to be [Sahasrahla](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda/images/5/50/Sahasrahla_\(manga\).jpg/revision/latest?cb=20090422044204). Sahasrahla has long been thought to be a descendant of Impa, which explains his longevity. He's of Sheikah blood. Ganon was born in OoT. Zelda and Link failing to stop Ganon lead to the precursor of the Era of Decline mentioned in the official timeline. I believe this story will expand on that.

I believe the Old Man saying that Hyrule is in a state of decline was a nod to this. "

If you've ever read the OoT Manga, it is explained that the Sheikah Eye Symbol was once represented as a single eye without a tear. This changed when, long ago, an act of betrayal on the part of the Royal Family of Hyrule occurred, resulting in the banishment of the Sheikah tribe from the kingdom of Hyrule for a long time. To commemorate this event, the tear was added to symbolize the great sorrow felt by the tribe, which was sworn to protect the Royal Family. The manga also states that pierced ears were a traditional Sheikah rite of passage for young males.

What this tells us is two things. The 4 beasts were released after Zelda and Link failed to stop Ganon and it describes the betrayal of the Royal family towards to Sheikah. I am 100% convinced this is a sequel to OoT in the Fallen Hero timeline taking place before LttP. I also believe that Link is of Shiekah descent."

That's why Hyrule was flooded and WW Link came to be. BotW clearly states that Link and Zelda failed 100 years ago and Link was put into stasis. Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks show how Hyrule evolved in that timeline and it's nothing like BotW. 

Phantom Hourglass is a direct sequel and Spirit Tracks in 100 years after those games."

46748,"Spirit Tracks has locomotives, tanks, turrets and hot air balloons.

The [Sheikah technology](https://zeldawiki.org/images/c/c9/TimeShiftStoneActiveSS.png) existed BEFORE Skyward Sword and laid dormant for millennia. With the Hero never failing, there was no reason to use it. Using it lead to the destruction of Hyrule.  "

They wear the Sheikah symbol inverted and wear red clothing instead of the blue. They most likely turned on the Royal family after being banished. Notice the pig-like tusks as well. The inverted symbol looks even more like Aghanim's symbol. The Big difference being [his is adorned with a crown on top](http://www.zeldadungeon.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/Aghanim1.png). The Gerudo only give birth to a male every 100 years and he is their King.

I know it's out there, but what if the evil Sheikah sect joined forces with the Gerudo to groom their king and imbibe him with Sheikah magic to exact revenge on the Royal Family? I'm probably reading way too much into it, but it sure is fun."
