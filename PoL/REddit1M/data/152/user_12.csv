17126,Also maybe the cataclysmic event that happened was death of link in fallen hero timeline and ganons subsequent rule of hyrule. 
19472,Just like how ganon/ganondorf is essentially from demise i could see link not being an individual person per se but more of a reincarnation of the same hero soul if that makes any sense at all. Its all up to interpretation but i believe this game takes place after the imprisoning war
