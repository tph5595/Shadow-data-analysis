0,"&gt;  it now seems clearer than ever that Breath of the Wild does indeed take place in the Fallen Hero timeline

Nothing from the map suggests this.
"
309,"&gt; which only have such a presence in the Fallen Hero timeline. 

They do?"
705,So what if this game explains why that's the case in the other timelines?  There you go the backstory may prove its in any timeline other than the fallen hero timeline gg.
4504,spells out what exactly?  Nothing here at all suggests to me that this is the downfall timeline.
6738,"&gt;This is 1000% the fallen hero timeline, its pretty much been confirmed

What?  No it hasn't

Every time I ask you for evidence you just say ""i don't need evidence its just true""  you're like a weird cultist at this point.

Edits: typing on phones sucks"
6834,The temple of time is in twilight princess which is in the child timeline dude.

Only one timeline has strong goron presence.

I can make stupid arguments as much as you can."
18080,But link is right handed my good sir.
42718,We do not know that.
44276,"I'm aware, nowhere does it say it is the sealing war of the fallen hero timeline.  You basically just lied to me."
45169,"Like, all of them really.

Either way just because its confirmed to happen in one timeline does NOT rule out that it happens in another."
45448,"I mean hes been sealed over and over again without actually fully defeating him in the vast majority of games.

And just because it is confirmed to happen in one timeline, doesn't mean it can't happen again in another timeline.

Actually I think its even less likely to happen in the fallen hero timeline given that we know about it, since for a main series game like BotW they probably really want to have room to create a backstory for it that hasn't already existed.

Also if the BotW backstory is the same backstory as ALttP, then what the heck happens in BotW, we don't defeat gannon?

I don't think you've really thought this through."
133120,The castle town is different from the OoT castle town.
217269,"No I mean the OoT castle town is on the great plateau and the TP castle town is the destroyed one near hyrule castle.  You can clearly see the ruins of both.

I still believe that BotW takes place in the child timeline given the presence of both castle towns."
300827,"The TP castle town only existed in the child timeline afaik.

There were other towns in other timelines but the one in BotW is clearly the same one as TP.  AND TP has the same ruined OoT castle town as BotW.  However, the temple of time is completely destroyed in TP but is mostly intact in BotW.

BotW being between TP and BotW is very unlikely as there is a short timeframe between the two and ofc no story in between.

Perhaps the temple of time was rebuilt?  Or some time shenanigans happened with it and it appeared in the future?

Or maybe the TP castle town was also built in a different timeline."
