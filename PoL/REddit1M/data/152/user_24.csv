38062,"I don't really *believe* that this will be the case (I think the game is probably at the end of the fallen timeline), but I really WANT it to be, and I think there is, at the very least, an adequate amount of evidence that supports it.  
  
One of my theories is that, if this IS the Hero of Time, that the ""100 years ago"" storyline is sort of an alternate reality version of the events of Ocarina of Time. I believe that, if this game is the genesis of the fallen timeline, that the timeline will split at the very end of the game (much like in OOT originally), and that through time manipulation mumbo jumbo, the ""new"" timeline that's created will be the events of OOT as we know them.  
  
In other words, I think there's a chance that this could be OOT Link, creating the downfall timeline, but that the downfall timeline is the ORIGINAL one, and that OOT's story is a consequence of what happens in this game.  
  
It looks like Link's ""failure"" comes from the Sheikah tech. The backstory seems to imply that Link and Zelda actually semi-successfully sealed Ganon, but then he somehow gained control of the Guardians, turning everything around and totally wrecking everyone's shit.   
  
What if BotW's resolution creates a time split where they prevent the Guardians from ever being used in the new timeline, thus allowing Link and Zelda to be successful as we know it in Ocarina of Time? Without the Guardians, Ganon is unable to strike back and would ostensibly remain sealed."
