4881,Where do you get this? The only games that have Sheikah in the fallen hero timeline are the Oracle games. I wouldnt call that a significant presence. There is presumably a whole village in Twilight Princess.
6756,"It hasnt been confirmed at all. If it is the Fallen Hero timeline, that would make the Link of BotW the same Link from OOT, and that seems an odd choice to me. Even Zelda would need to be the same Zelda as the one from OOT. Where is her outift? Where is the green tunic then? Everyone had a sudden change of fashion sense?"
6912,"Ive heard this as well, but Im not sure it makes sense. According to Link to the past, Ganon's army was defeated in the Imprisoning war by the Knights of Hyrule. There is no hint of that in BotW. Its pretty clear Hyrule got pretty much destroyed."
9499,"If Botw is at the end of the Fallen Hero timeline, which is possible, Botw Link cannot be the ""Fallen Hero"" of OOT. Botw Link fails so to speak 100 years before the events of Botw, and there is no way that all the other games of the Fallen Hero timeline fit in that 100 years."
9755,"Except none of the Timelines have strong Sheikah presence. Only one sheikah like character appears in the Fallen timeline, and thats in the Oracle games."
10643,"Nope. But all the Fallen timeline games are old and use incredible simple graphics. Its hard to compare geography or architecture that way. A link to the past Hyrule is pretty different from OoT Hyrule. Even Twilight Princess's Temple of Time, which is suppose to be the same building from OoT is pretty different."
13912,"How does the map indicate Fallen hero timeline though? The map say the princess and hero failed, so if that means the fallen hero timeline, that would make them, the exact same characters from OoT. But they have very different appearances and different outfits. Also where does the Imprisoning war and Events of A link to the Past fit in? Are you saying that Calamity Ganon being sealed in the castle is BoTW is the imprisoning war? Then what happened to ALttP? The Map honestly doesnt say anything to indicate one timeline or another."
14359,"Except its clear that the Link we play in BotW is the one that failed 100 years ago to beat Ganon. The fallen hero timeline is called that casue OoT link failed to beat Ganon, leading to the imprisoning war where ganon is sealed away and the events of AlttP. Are you saying that the BotW link fails later in the timeline? Then why cant that happen in other timelines?"
14714,"Im not sure its confirmed, but with the whats said in the trailer, about Link not remembering what happened and being ready to be told what happend. But if hes not the same link as the one from 100 years ago, then what about AlttP and other games on the Fallen Hero Timeline? There is no way that they occur during this 100 year interlude."
24918,"Never read the manga. Thats kinda interesting. But isnt Agahnim just Ganon? When you kill him, Ganon literally comes out of his body. I dont buy him being a sheikah at all."
