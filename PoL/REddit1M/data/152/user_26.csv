45106,"In what timeline did Zelda and Link fail to defeat Ganon and then Ganon was Sealed?

"
45376,Never heard of failing to beat Ganon except in the downfall timeline
128926,"Actually it could work, if BoTW takes place centuries before ALttP (In ALttP Hyrule is rebuilt, so BoTW could show how Hyrule went from being mostly destroyed after OoT to being rebuilt)

If you recall in A Link Between World's also took Place in the Fallen timeline, between Awakening and LoZ 1, BoTW could fall between OoT and  ALttP and show how Hyrule was restored after the Imprisoning war
"
216427,"OoT takes place in all 3 timelines (the divergence occurs after OoT), so that could be merely due to upgraded graphics tech since N64"
300153,"Okay, So the second castle town only existed in the child timeline?

There were no other towns in any of the other timelines?

Are you 100% certain of that?"
