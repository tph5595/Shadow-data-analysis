77439,Why does the option have to be there for children? I think children will be fine not being able to pick their genders on certain games. I got by just fine when I played a game with a female protagonist. 
79086,"Why should links gender have to change? There is literally no reason for it. Link is an established character whether you like it or not. The whole reincarnation thing is just there so they can make games with the same characters  without them being hugely connected in terms of the plot. Wanting a character to stay the same isn't ""intolerance"". 

Would you be happy if Samus changed gender, or what about a reimagining of tomb raider where Laura croft is a boy? I bet you wouldn't like this."
163707,"Pokemon changes the characters each generation, and it's not just a gender swap. Each person you play as is their own character. 

The people who want it are the over sensitive ones actually. They are unable to just accept link as an established character within the Zelda universe and play as a male. There is no reason to swap his gender and not every game needs to have the option. It's so annoying to see people constantly bitch about, and they only seem to do so when the character is male.

I don't ask for them to make a game set in an alternate dimension where  Laura is a male just so I can play as my gender. I understand that Laura is an established character and that would be stupid.

I don't ask Nintendo to make an alternate Samus so I can be a male. I mean Samus is almost a blank slate, but that would still be stupid because she is an established character."
