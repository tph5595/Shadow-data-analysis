24403,"I actually sat through the trailer thinking ""please let Link get naked""

and lo and behold my prayers were answered.  

"
24435,"Not just the ladies

it's not gay if it's Link "
24534,"The Hero of Time was my first gay crush

But now I'm breaking up with him.  Sorry baby.  "
24549,Stupid sexy Link! 
24617,"We had a Zelda with a female protagonist.

It was called Twilight Princess and the heroine's name was Midna. "
28514,"Good.  

I went into that subreddit a few times, and I swear the people I spoke to on there were like every negative stereotype about female gamers rolled into one.  "
28693,"I generally identify with female characters better, so I usually prefer games with female protagonists.

Buuuuuuut.

Anything that sets up a wailing and a gnashing of teeth amongst Kohaku and TheMarySue gives me a delightful sense of scheudenfreude. "
30889,"I don't want a female Link, I'd like a new game series with a female protagonist.  I'd much rather have another heroine to join the likes of Samus, Lara or Alis Landale then a lazy genderbend to an established character. "
31952,"Well off the top of my head, I can think of: Beyond Good and Evil, American McGee's Alice, the original Phantasy Star, Wild Arms 3, Xenosaga, Metroid, Lost Kingdoms 1 and 2, Silent Hill 3, Lady Sia, Fatal Frame, Tomb Raider, Perfect Dark, Bayonetta, Eternal Darkness, Final Fantasy VI and XIII, Kameo, Koudelka, Tales of Beseria, Jeanne D'arc, La Pucelle Tactics, the Atelier series, Grim Grimoire, Panzer Dragoon, Portal, Shantae, Haunting Ground, Rule of Rose, Mirror's Edge... just because there aren't as many videogames with female protagonists as there are male, doesn't mean there's hardly any.

This is also not counting games that either give you the option to have a male or female protagonist: Sword of Mana, Pok√©mon, Tales of Xillia, Metal Slug, Star Ocean the Second Story, Odin Sphere, Mass Effect/Dragon Age, Survival Kids, Soul Caliber, most Resident Evil games (to name a few) or most JRPGs were you have a party of multiple playable characters, male and female, or games like Twilight Princess, were the main playable character is male, but actually features a female protagonist, storyline wise.  Final Fantasy 12 had Ashe being far, far, far, far more important to the storyline were Vaan was almost irrelevant to Ashe's journey to reclaim her kingdom.

If you think that female protagonists are so rare in gaming that the bowl is almost empty, then you just don't know much about games. "
32089,Because straight white women are so poorly represented in the media 
32713,"So?  There's still so many games with female protagonists.  Far more then the ""almost empty bowl of m and ms"" analogy claims. "
33774,"And his growls.

I swear there were some sword skills I just kept spamming over and over because of his sexy growls and yells. "
34239,"Well, you're the one missing out on a ton of fantastic games with female protagonists and characters by choosing to remain wilfully ignorant of them so you can cling to a false sense of victimhood perpetuated by people who really don't play games.  Your loss. "
34668,"I'm guessing you don't, because your ignorance of the many, many games with female protagonists and strong female characters is pretty obvious. 

Stay on Gawker, malcontent.  I'm sure the parts that have been sold off will tell you what to be offended about next. "
34811,"A group that still has quite a lot more then they want to give themselves credit for, you mean? "
35080,"I love how pointing out the complete lie that there is a near complete absence of female characters in video games that is constantly perpetuated by people who have only a passing at best interest in video games is ""terrible logic"".  But okay. "
35287,So then the bowl shouldn't be almost empty? 
35440,"There's a difference between poking holes in a shitty analogy and not knowing what one is, honey. "
35708,Why don't you go back to school?  Maybe they'll teach you an analogy that anyone with a half decent knowledge of games won't be able to poke holes in. 
36217,"The more you talk, the more I realise it's not me who should go back to school. "
36329,Projection isn't a very pleasant habit.  You should work on that. 
36417,"""You thought my analogy was stupid!  That means you don't understand what an analogy is!""

Ok.  "
