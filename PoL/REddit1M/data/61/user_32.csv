10040,"Uh, I would argue Link's tunic is far more recognizable and iconic than his gender (he already looks somewhat feminine to begin with.) And they just changed his tunic out. I don't think we've even seen footage of BotW with Link in a green tunic. 

What about his gender defines him here, more than something like his tunic? Honestly, if I didn't know this was a Zelda game and saw some screenshots of this, I might not even know it was Link to begin with. A lot of people thought he was Zelda after the first reveal."
