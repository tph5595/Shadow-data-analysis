51883,"100% Accurate! Since Link is a reincarnated character, gender is meaningless for each reincarnation. In fact, the spiritual roots of reincarnation demand that a fully realized entity experience human life as both genders at least once... So there's a thematic reason to making Link female.

Think of Link as the Avatar from Avatar (ie each Link is the spirit of courage/heroism). The character could be An or Korra, and the fictional universe and character journey's are enriched by that very dichotomy.


That answers if Link *could* be female in the LoZ universe.... But *should* that happen? Personally, I think it's imperative that it happens (and I'm male and a die-hard LoZ fan). I think it's imperative because of what Link represents (the spirit of courage/heroism). Woman tend to be severely under represented in that archetype, especially in video games. The sad thing about that is it could be a supurb character story if a big publisher would just do it."
52316,"That argument is not valid for Link. 1) As a reincarnation, gender is meaningless, and 2) The very reason the character is named Link, is because it's supposed to serve as nothing more than a Link/Avatar between the game and audience (which.... believe it or not... is not solely comprised of bratty little boys that can't handle girls having nice thing too)"
52797,This! The idea of Link being female shouldn't be met with such intolerance in 2016. it's very distressing coming from the fandom of a series that I care about so much.
52966,There's no reason the armor/cloths in the demo shown today could not be considered unisex. It would almost be worse to make Link female and turn the iconic tunic into a bikini (/hyperbole)
