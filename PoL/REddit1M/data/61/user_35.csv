10608,"For me personally Link would not be Link if they suddenly made him female. No specific reason, it just wouldn't be him. Just as I identify other people partly by their gender, I identify Link as a ""guy"". Seeing him dive into the water, bare chested, as a dude fits. Yes he looks feminine but that doesn't matter to me, Link is a guy end of story. I would have a really hard time getting over the fact that they changed his gender. Nintendo of course is free to do so if they please but I don't know if I'd enjoy the game as much (yes gameplay and story have nothing to do with his gender but being weirded out by it would ruin my experience to some degree)."
10885,"&gt; the creators feel that gives the difference between being immersed in the game and watching the game like a movie.

Now it finally clicks with me why I can't seem to enjoy games like Tomb Raider or Uncharted. They're puzzle and explore games like Zelda but the hyper realism and the characters actually talking take me out of the immersion rather than pushing me in deeper. Never had that problem with Zelda."

One step at a time. I'm not a fan of the female link idea and at first I wasn't sure if I liked the RPG things they added to BotW (stats? Different gear/weapons? Making food, eating it mid-battle? What is this, Skyrim: zelda edition?!) but it's growing on me more and more. If they made Link female the idea might grow on me but I'd prefer it not to be pushed on top of the RPG gameplay."
