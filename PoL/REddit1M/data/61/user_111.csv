So No it doesn't make sense in universe."

41289,"The Hyrule Historia.

The Goddess Hylia calls a descendant of Link one of the knights of hyrule to protect hyrule in times of great need. They would gain his strength and courage and fight to protect the Hyrulian royal family.

Sure it's not said "" only guy "" however when you look at it from Medieval or Mythological points of view, Knights were guys. A knight in shining armor protecting their princess who've they have sworn to protect.

Sure Link COULD be female, there's no rule saying they can't, but the tradition in Zelda, and even in the bigger mythology it draws from would make it very much so not the norm.

By making the knight a woman you complicate the narrative. You've changed it slightly and it's expected you'll change it more. In the same way if you changed the Frog prince into a Princess you change the narrative of that story, and are then expected to change it further.

Those are my 2 cents on it, and I don't know if I did a good job explaining it. Oh well."
41972,"Gathering Open world Zelda makes perfect sense. It's very similar to the first game, and Zelda has always had a bit of gathering.

But even with that it's not really changing the nature of the Zelda games. The Zelda games have always been a video game fairy tale. Something like King Arthur legends but made into a game.

Turning Link into a girl DOES change that, it breaks the formula of Knight saving princess from monster, very slightly mind you but it DOES change it. They can't just make Link female, not without it feeling super pointless, and thus super pandering.

So clearly with this title that's already changing the formula so much, they decided to keep one thing the same. ( Well two things ) Link being Male and the Master Sword. 

Pretty much everything else is different."
