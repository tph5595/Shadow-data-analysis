29796,"Fallout 4's protagonist, male or female, was about as interesting as a brick. If you go poking around /r/Fallout, you'll find that much of FO4's criticism is directed towards the player character, main storyline, and general lack of agency to create an interesting protagonist.

Courier Six, on the other hand, was an object lesson in how to make the player character ""yours"" through your decisions. There were a dozen different factions you could affect, each one in multiple ways. Your choices shaped the Mojave, and there were literally hundreds of different ways it could all end up."
