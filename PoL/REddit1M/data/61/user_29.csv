9462,In this game his entire outfit is changed to something totally different. So I don't think they really care about making Link recognizable this time around.
9635,The character IS a shell. 
10915,"It's not lazy, he's literally reincarnated every game. That's not an excuse, that's just what happens. Link is a completely different character in every game. In some games he has blonde hair, in some games he has brown. Sometimes blue eyes, sometimes black. In this game he has a totally different outfit. What difference does making Link a woman and not a man make? "
11626,In most games Link and Zelda hardly even interact. But Skyward Sword had TONS of romance so I don't know where they'd go with this game.
11916,And is Link being male any kind of characterization? When has his gender ever factored into anything?
12986,"He could do that as a woman, too. In the 2014 trailer I thought he WAS a woman but I still knew it was Link."
21259,"Yeah, sure, it's not like I've been a fan of Zelda for years or anything."
22585,Link isn't even one character. He's reincarnated in several games.
31450,"No, it's several. A female Link would be just another one."
48009,And a male incarnation isn't?
