9339,"Zelda is essentially an rpg.

I don't see the issue in picking your gender.

We're talking about reincarnation and shit."
9433,"If people care so much about their cannon then they'd know that Link is just a reincarnation.

I haven't seen anything in cannon that says different Links all have to be male.

You guys are getting upset over something so, so silly.

Edit: unless I missed the ""Rules of Reincarnation"" book somewhere in one of the games.  Please correct me if I have."
9808,"Ganon was also a pig once.  His image has changed over the years.

I mean what the fuck kind of point are you trying to make?  This is as silly as a heated timeline debate on YouTube.

Zelda games are about the adventure, among other things.  Not about having a penis."
10572,"Zelda is an adventure game, sure.  But to say there's no RPG elements whatsoever in Zelda games is silly.

But I must just be getting old because this entire ""Link should always be male 100% of the time he is reincarnated"" is such a dumb thing to argue about.  

I really don't give a shit.

Nobody else should either, since you would get the *choice*."
11183,"That's my point, I don't.

I'd get the choice.  So I'd pick the Link with a penis and go on with my day and enjoy the game.

I certainly wouldn't write up an essay on Reddit about how all Links should be male, and about how important the timeline is in a Zelda game.  

It's a beautiful new Zelda game.  Stop obsessing over silly childish things and enjoy it."
11879,"I wasn't just talking about you m8, there are others in this thread.

&gt; Nintendo wrote a fucking book about the timeline and it's still something people spend time talking about.

I'm aware, and I thought it was silly.  I've always enjoyed Zelda, since I was 5 years old, but I've never obsessed over which game was first or what happens next.  

I mean the word ""Legend"" implies a tale that is passed down generation to generation.  In fact, legends often change over time as younger generations retell the stories.  That's what a ""legend"" is. 

&gt;Legend (Noun): a **nonhistorical** or **unverifiable story** *handed down by tradition* from earlier times.

Hmm.  It almost sounds like a ""legend"" isn't entirely factual but instead is fluid, and minor details (such as the sex or gender of a character) can certainly change throughout the numerous retellings of the story through the ages.

&gt;Adding in a female Link would do nothing but pander to this modern idea that diversity is more important than anything else, and add development time to a game that already is averaging 5 years to make.

I don't even know where to begin with this one.  Other than the fact that you're insinuating that a female model wasn't considered since the start of development.  It sounds like you have strong feelings against the appearance of a female Link, and that's just so silly.

What did you think of Hyrule Warriors?  I have a feeling you despised it, regardless of gameplay mechanics, simply because Linkle appeared."
12146,"Exactly.  

These people need to look up what the word ""Legend"" means.  Here, I'll help you all:

&gt; Legend (Noun): a nonhistorical or unverifiable story handed down by tradition from earlier times.

Ouch.

12434,"&gt; Most people's reactions were that they were underwhelmed and thought she was a pointless addition to the game. 

Source?

Not that you'd bother with that.

I find it funny you completely disregarded the rest of my post and kept the focus on your irrational hatred towards Linkle."
13639,"Wew Lad, that's not what I said m8.

Read again, slower this time.

&gt; **Zelda is an adventure game, sure.** But to say there's no **RPG elements** whatsoever in Zelda games is silly."
15207,"...Try one more time, even slower maybe?

&gt;RPG elements =/= RPG.

I know, which is why I said the following, *twice*:

&gt; Zelda is an adventure game, sure. But to say there's no RPG elements whatsoever in Zelda games is silly.

And the following comment is so dumb it hurts my head:

&gt; There's virtually zero reason to allow the player a choice in gender

And what's your reason for not including the choice for gender?  This is the **Legend** of Zelda.

Do you know what the word ""legend"" means? ""Legend"" implies a tale that is passed down generation to generation. In fact, legends change over time as younger generations retell the stories. That's literally what a ""legend"" is.

&gt; Legend (Noun): a **nonhistorical or unverifiable story** handed down by tradition from earlier times.

Hmm. It almost sounds like a ""legend"" isn't entirely factual but instead is fluid, and minor details (such as the sex or gender of a character) can certainly change throughout the numerous retellings of the story through the ages."
15631,"&gt; Except the ""Legend"" in this case IS verified.

That's not how legends work m8.  I literally copy/pasted the definition for legend from Webster.  Take it up with him.

You'd preform all kinds of mental gymnastics to justify your irrational hatred towards a female Link.

It hurts my brain.

&gt; everyone on the internet ""offended"" over something they should never have been offended by in the first place.

Jeeeesus christ dude. You took the words right out of my mouth.  The irony is not lost on me.  It's gorgeous.

You're the one offended over something you should never be offended by.  It's more choice.  "
