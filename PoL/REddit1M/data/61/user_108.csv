Getting annoyed that there isn't a genderbent version of a male character is super weird to me. Why would, or should, you expect that? It's not like Zelda is lacking in cool female characters, and so many games today have female protagonists or offer a choice. So what if the protagonist is a guy? Does it really matter so much?

I don't think I've ever cared what gender a character is in a video game at all, let alone as much as people seem to about Link."
38345,"To say Nintendo is keeping it from us implies that we are somehow owed a female Link, or that it should be a default option. I don't see why that would be the case. A female only Link might honestly work (I'd prefer just playing as Zelda) but a choice could bring about a lot of writing issues (dialogue could feel detached due to being gender neutral, certain situations and interactions would have to be avoided due to being seen as ""inappropriate"" for a certain gender, and the Gerudo would have to be written twice if they are in the game, basically)"
