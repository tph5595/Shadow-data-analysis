We as the player don't get to see that portion of the story because the creators feel that gives the difference between being immersed in the game and watching the game like a movie. The real point being that a lazy gender swap would be bad writing and they'd be better off making a new character or taking an established female character and creating a new narrative. And lastly while Link has slight androgynous features keep in mind that Link is rarely portrayed as older than 17 and more often younger, and so sex specific features aren't going to be as pronounced.

11524,"Hair, eye, and clothing color is hardly any sort of characterization. And if you paid any attention at all the 3D links have all been blonde blue eyed boys or teens who at some point will probably have a green tunic and the master sword. That's a locked in part of the story that they have been building since OOT, and further cemented in Skyward Sword where it was plain as day explained that an incarnation of the Hero (Link) the Goddess (Zelda) and the Demon (Ganon) would battle forever always returning to the world and Skyward Sword set up the archetypes of these characters. A gender swap is lazy writing, if they introduced new characters to be one of those archetypes and remixed and changed them all up to be whatever that would fine and great but they shouldn't be Zelda and Link and Ganon unless they are going to be Zelda, Link, and Ganon. Changing gender for the sake of changing gender adds nothing to the character and is a lazy way to pander. "
