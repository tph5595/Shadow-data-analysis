I find it incredibly confusing how anyone could get angry about any aspect of this. Would people be actually be upset if they gave you an option at the beginning to play as a male or female? That's just another feature of the game, and if you don't want to play as a lady, don't.

They were never consistent with the whole left-handed thing either, so fuck it, nothing is sacred."

A slimmer waist and different body proportions, and then the game is the same. And people would take that as positive or negative depending on their stance. I'm totally fine with making it a meaningless choice at the beginning of the game. 

People will be upset whatever they do."

I've always replaced Link with my own name, and I never planned on changing. Its a huge bummer if I can't do that now. I guess I took it for granted and I guess I also took it for granted that the male pronouns fitted me. 

In some bizarre way, I wouldn't mind if Link was female and I couldn't change her name, because I have never played as Link, I played as Alex, and Alex is the male hero of the games to me.

Link is pretty neutral too, but Nintendo still decided to make a Linkle for that 3DS game. They're all over the place."
