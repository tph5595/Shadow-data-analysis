11230,"I think he knows what it means.  
Generally people think that there's male, female and androgynous as half of male and female, both physically and in character.  

I'm not sure what you mean by femlink would be androgynous though. Because one way to look at it is to say ""femlink is female so why would it be ""fairly androgynous?"" as per the idea above.

Another way is to say ""Femlink has female physical charecteristics, but she's still a badass monster slaying hero, so she's androgynous."" But that would be to say those characteristics are solely male. Which i don't believe and saying so will cause a shitstorm. 

So i'm not sure what in what direction you mean to say femlink would be fairly androgynous, but still i agree Link is pretty badass.

So why not just streamline it from the beginning."
