37207,"Eh, he's a character with many different incarnations - although the courage of spirit comes to reside in each Link, each Link is an individual person himself.  I'd be open to the spirit of Courage being genderless itself, and the vessel that holds it possibly being either gender in future titles."
37384,"I don't care either, and I think it's dumb that people are mad Link can't be female.  But I think it would be cool, and not necessarily bad, if Link could be either gender in a future game.  Though each Link is a reincarnation, they're individual characters as well, so it wouldn't be out of the question if those that house the Spirit of Courage could vary in gender as well.  Point being that I don't think it would be bad to have the option, but I'm not really disappointed or mad that it isn't one. "
37553,Why wouldn't it?
37942,"Link is already a superhuman person, he regularly lifts huge boulders and takes down huge enemies despite the fact he isn't an uber-muscular Kratos-type.  I don't think being a girl would be too much of a stretch in the Zelda universe."
38605,"How does Link lift a gigantic sword bigger than himself himself in Skyward Sword during Koloktos' boss battle, despite being a pretty-boy with no muscle mass in that one?  How does Link swim so far underwater without getting the bends in the water temple?

The answer is that it's a video game, ya dingus.  Developers often nix some realism in the interest of having fun.  Dark Souls has female player characters just as capable of playing through the game as male characters, and you don't see anyone complain about that.

And remember, Link's strength is already cartoonish compared to his body mass and musculature.  It can already be written off that he's a bit superhuman and magic, so you could say the same for a female Link."
39317,"&gt;That's because the people who would complain don't play female.

So why are you complaining if they added the option?  You wouldn't choose it."

Furthermore, Link is iconic because of his outfit (the iconic green cap is a lot more recognizable than blonde-haired elf), his shield, and his sword, not because he has a penis.  He's bishonen-enough, in recent incarnations anyways, that a female version wouldn't look out of place, (he's a popular choice among female cosplayers as well because he looks androgynous enough for one to pull it off).  People like Linkle from Hyrule Warriors as well, who's pretty much a female version of Link.  I think a lot of people are quite open to this."
