10395,"I don't think it's anything like an RPG. You have no real control over who your character will be. You will always be Link. Calling Legend of Zelda a RPG would be like calling Assassins Creed a RPG. The story in Legend of Zelda has always been the same for everyone's experience. When I think of a RPG, I think Elder Scrolls or Mass Effect in which the main character has decisions that matter and can have the main character be differentiated in personality and motives. "
