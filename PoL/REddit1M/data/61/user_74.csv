23076,"You forgot Skyward Sword.

Nothing really incorrect with anything else you said (I could argue all of them except for the original, but meh). But your last sentence is wrong.

26013,"Gonna work backwards because I'm working solely off memory.

* Skyward Sword - You're the next-door neighbor and best friend of the mayor's daughter. You have an ongoing rivalry with the town goons and their leader. It's practically screaming at everyone that you have an active attraction to your best friend and vice-versa. You seem to be generally slow to start your day and rather aloof, but a hard-worker and helpful member of the community. And you have a side-gig at the town's floating island bar (this last one happens during the game, I'm just joking around).

* Twilight Princess - You're a simple farmer boy who helps herd goats at the ranch every day. You are friends with the mayor's daughter (but this time she's not Zelda, woah) and the mayor sees you as a trustworthy person. I think he even implies seeing you as a son/son-in-law at one point early on. Link is also seen as skilled with a sword and idolized/seen as an older brother by the kids of the village, especially Colin.

* Wind Waker - You're a grandson *and a caring older brother*. You're a student of the combat school on the island and the school's teacher hints that your skill with the sword comes from your lineage/parents. In fact, you seem to be the only boy of age on your island. Which probably isn't a coincidence, but yeah.

* Ocarina of Time - You are a Hylian who got dropped off with a tree and a bunch of Kokiris by your parents as they escaped some war. As such, several of the children of the forest treated you as an outcast and one straight up doesn't trust you (though he may trust no one, honestly). Except Saria, who watched you grow up and befriended you. And because you didn't have a fairy, you were the only one not allowed to enter the Lost Woods.

I must admit my memory is fuzzy of LttP and Minish Cap, so I won't even try those/I was incorrect in saying there's more to Link for all of those entries. But while OoT and WW could be considered not enough backstory to suffice, I don't know how one can argue that Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess isn't satisfactory."
