40463,Where has that been said?
40639,"Tomb Raider probably isn't the best comparison. Lara is a fairly well-defined character and it wouldn't make sense to change her into a guy. Link really isn't defined so much, other than Hero. The only example of male characterization I can think of off the top of my head is Ruto wanting to marry him, but that has no bearing on other incarnations of the Hero."
40759,"Zelda games aren't exactly focused on realistic anatomy. You can lift massive boulders just with magic gloves, I don't think muscle mass is a concern."
40820,"Make Link and Zelda gay. It's a fantasy world, they can do what they want."
40910,"None of those are typically gendered traits, though. You could easily have Link be either."
