25879,"Uh, no. I will admit there are certain changes that I'm not a fan of such as voice acting, however my personal reason why I was strongly against having Link as a female character by choice, is because it would create a precedence where for the next game, people want to be able to customize the hair. Then they want to customize the skin tone. Then at this point, we might as well just use Miis as our Link.

I think that would just take it too far. I'm open for customization, but I think there has to be drawn a line somewhere. I'd totally be down for a Zelda game where you actually controlled Zelda or Sheikh though."
