I love both the recent Tomb Raiders and it doesn't matter to me that Lara is a woman. It's cool but I never bought either game because ""omg so cool a girl protagonist"". It's like ""oh cool, Lara Croft sweet"" just like it's ""oh cool, Link sweet"" or ""oh cool, Nathan Drake sweet"". I fail to see how Zelda is tailored to straight white men...he's always been a male since before this gender equality in games shit is going on (not that I don't support gender equality I'm just saying). Why change him NOW? Why did people even EXPECT him to be changed? Because people misunderstood and thought he had boobs in the first trailer so people thought he was female? That's their own fault...not Nintendo's."
