Additionally regardless of being a shell or a fully developed character I think Fallout 4's main story campaign has all but proven you can have two emotionally deep player characters that were typically complete blank slates before. Now even though Breath of the Wild is adapting a bit of Bethesda spirit it clearly shouldn't copy it.

Really I'm just glad we are getting a really good game. Ultimately The Legend of Zelda has always had a strong female character, but you probably won't get to play her given she's often the stereotypical damsel in distress.

Speaking of strong ladies, I hope we see Ashei again or rather her descendant, This seems like the type of world where she would shine. "
