15139,"Not anymore, probably, because the voice-over clearly says ""Link"". I wouldn't be against a male/female option or against just having Link be female for one iteration but I do like that they seem to be making him into more of an actual character and less of a player stand-in."
37324,"While I (as, which is probably slightly relevant here, a white male person) find it ridiculous to demand that the next Doctor or Bond not be a white British man, or that Link be a woman, and even more ridiculous to be outraged when it doesn't happen, I do see the point behind the idea. No, Link doesn't have to be female. But he could be and some people think it'd be a great idea.

For most characters this argument would be meaningless. While we love to draw or look at gender-bent drawings on the internet, it just wouldn't make any sense for most characters to suddenly switch gender between two stories (especially not if it has to be shoehorned into the plot because that just makes everything worse). But in some cases it's different. Link is not Link. Link is barely even a character, for the most part he's just a boring player stand-in, but (with the exception of Majora's Mask's Link) he is specifically stated to always be a different Link. He's the heroic spirit of Skyward Sword's Link reincarnated into a new time and body each and every time. There's no reason one of his incarnations has to be female but there similarly is no reason it can't be. Same thing except more obvious for the Doctor: there's plenty of precedent of regeneration changing a Timelord's skin colour, gender, accent, personality, and even more general shape (such as the amount of heads if I recall correctly).

For most characters such a thing is impossible, but these are specifically characters for which it could work. So why not give it a try. Not now, and not because of some moral obligation, and not for all of them, but eventually for one or two. Avatar did it, and that guy was reincarnated just like Link."
37721,"You bring up a good point with which I agree but it might have been more effort than what it's worth. Specifically in this game it might have required a lot of extra effort depending on how their armour models work and depending on how some armour skins might look. I'm not blaming anyone for not wanting to spend a lot of time and money on that extra mile, especially for a game that has already been delayed this much and fir which nobody had a realistic expectation for that feature anyway.

76895,I think it'd work just fine for a female character.
