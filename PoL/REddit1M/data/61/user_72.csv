22776,"So what you're saying is that if they added an option to let yu chose his gender, you would continue to play as a guy. Would it be wrong if others chose to play as a girl?"
22933,"Okay, but what about that would be broken if Link was female?"

28313,"From a design perspective, Link is a blank slate. He has few if any personality characteristics, and those he has are always inoffensive and widely relatable. His background is always of little importance. And so on. Link is always designed to be the player's avatar, literally a link between the player and the game."
