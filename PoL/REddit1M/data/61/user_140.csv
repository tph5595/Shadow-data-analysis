I would prefere the main titles of the series to keep the basic formulae, but, I would love to see side games exploring the Hyrule world as any number of new and old characters."
278599,"Well the formulae has always been: Princess zelda, boy/child/youth/adult Link, Ganon's many forms and his puppets. That formulae leaves a lot of room for any number of side characters, and there is nothing to stop them from creating a side-game where we play as characters other than Link."
279119,"Link has had a personality, no matter how small, since we first saw his expressions in OoT. TP clearly has him grow braver and more confident through the game and SS had Link reacting to romance, bullying, betrayal, etc. these are strong emotions so it's clear that we have got to the point of no return, now it would be an injustice the the character of Link to reduce his integrity by making him a female character.

A game, off the traditional formulae, set in Hyrule has all the opportunity to host any amount of different player characters. I think Hyrule Warriors is a good example of this."
279420,"Then make a separate protagonist within the same LC universe, by making it a choice between two different characters rather than two genders, you don't degrade the original character."
279929,"Even having the option degrades the character as boys and girls lead very different lives, part of what makes Link relatable and charming is the fact he deals with situations you would expect a young man/little boy to do so and then you see his growth from youth to adult in which he becomes braver and confident.  

To swap his body with a woman's would be ridiculous as you can't possible expect two genders to deal with problems in a similar way at a young age, therefore, Nintendo would have to reduce Link's reactions, his personality, in order to make it adaptable into two genders, lessening the integrity of the character himself.   

I, and many other people I'm sure, would prefer to see a standalone game with a female protagonist rather than one of our favorite male protagonists gender-swapped into an avatar state."
281296,"Simply because it lessens the integrity of the character. Since, OoT, we have seen Zelda and Link develop as characters over the course of the game. In order to make them gender fluid Nintendo would have to degrade the characters as men and women will have very different reactions to the world around them, especially at a young age and therefore we would be regressing into a period where Link and Zelda were emotionless Spirtes. Can you think of another game series that gives 'gender-swap' options after the gender of the main characters had already been established ten times over? no.

Look at Mass Effect for example, Bioware had no idea the first game would be so successful and they marketed it on Male Shepard, FemShep was more of an afterthought which is clear because she is equally as masculine as MaleShep. Later games fixed this issue, allowing for more feminine dialogue, yet, it's clear that FemShep was a tomboy rather than the typical female whereas Male Shepard was a typical male character. 

Bioware's most recent RPG, DA:I, didn't have this problem. The designers were aiming for a gender-fluid PC from the beginning, this was fine as Dragon Age had always focused on its party characters, not the PC. DA:2 focused on the story of a single man/woman without optional races, which most people felt was restrictive, yet they loved the personality of their PC. DA:I's PC was a husk, fluid to the point where they had no personality unless the player imposed it upon them, nobody remembers DA:I for their DA:I avatar.

Link and Zelda are **not** avatars."

281606,You are kidding yourself if you think any of the 3D Link characters have no personality or backstory.
