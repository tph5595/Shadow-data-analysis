32476,"people want a female link because he isnt a character, he is an avatar and it is less immersive to play a male avatar for female players.

If link had personality and emotions like say Mario or Samus, no one would want to change Link."
33076,A female link is still possible. I imagine her armorless outfit would be a 1sie or trunks and tube top like in monster hunter but longer
80422,"XD Not really. I would agree if he had personality and showed emotion but he doesn't.

And thanks to the historia and the connected time line which everyone loves so very much devalues link even further. You don't play as Link, you play as a link. Just another blank slate hero for the player to project themselves onto to go temporarily solve the same problem as the last link and the 1 before that. : )"
