14083,"Listen, writers and developers don't HAVE to do anything, but I can't pretend I'm not disappointed. Regardless of backstory, Link is a bit of a shell. You are the hero of time, your defining feature being bravery. My first Zelda game I was taken out of immersion every time they used a male pronoun. I understand it's a timeline, but reincarnation usually implies that you are not the same link. Ganon, Zelda, and Link are all shown to be connected throughout universes, but theoretically gender shouldn't control this. I get that gender always has been passed down, I do, but the explanation offered about why a change gender doesn't work seemed a little weak. Although I get Zelda not being a protagonist because she is actually a very non-interesting character (except for that classic CD-I game which had Zelda as the protagonist).

It isn't gender inequality which made me hopeful for a female protagonist, it was staying immersed in the experience. Let's be honest, I'm not going to look like a 4'10""-5'0"" skinny, pointy eared character, regardless of gender. But a change in pronoun would be welcome. Other games with female-only protagonists are notorious for the tendency of being designed to be objectified, but besides that, they aren't reincarnations. They're the same person.

Creatively Nintendo owes me nothing, but the answer about it not being possible side-stepped why Link can't be female and only explained that Zelda can't be the protagonist. I'm still disappointed because I wanted it and it would fit in the lore fine, but I understand why it wouldn't. But you can't blame Nintendo's writers for having a specific vision, just like you can't be mad at people for wanting it anyway. If I want to change my name, I also want to change my pronouns so I can actually be the hero.

But bigger question, can you rename yourself? The voice acting says ""Link""... By changing the ability to change the name concretes that this is a specific character, not your name."

Nothing is set in stone until launch date, Nintendo constantly changes things. Maybe you'll rename yourself, or maybe if you change the name, ""Link"" will be cut from the voiceover line.

Edit: the hero of my games is named Lola because that's an old nickname of mine. Link is the overarching story, Lola is my hero. He was a dancer, his name was Lola. Probably working at that bar in Hyrule from TP lol."
