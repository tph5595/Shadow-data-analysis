73745,"The only thing that bugs me about this is that it makes Linkle from Triforce Heroes completely pointless.  She was introduced around the same time as we started getting screenshots from this, and there was the really androgynous looking Link with the hood (though let's face it, Link's always been very androgynous looking).  Being female Link with a hood is basically Linkle's thing, which I think is where the rumours got started in the first place.

It wouldn't have been hard to let you choose whether you wanted to start the game as Link or Linkle.  Really all this confirms is just that Linkle is just an original character created by the team that made Triforce Heroes, and nothing else."
