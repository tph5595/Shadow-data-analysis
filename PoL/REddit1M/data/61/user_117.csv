49707,"Im gonna get hate for this, but changing an existing character does not bring forth equality or change anything for the better. Make new characters, or a new entry in an estblished game series with a new protagonist and gender options (IE: xenoblade chronicles x). Or encourage games that already exist that HAVE strong female protagonists. But saying Link NEEDS to be female, is a little forced and ham fisted. I get the sentiment, but it just doesnt make sense, like how did that even occur to people as a supposed option. No one insists mario, or samus, or fox mccloud, or anyone else from a nintendo game needs a new gender. Its not even a worthwhile change that fits a story. While female protagonists are dreadfully under represented, implying that there is some new perspective to tell by flipping a gender of someone who has been established just because its trendy to do so now is stupid, and frankly sexist in and of itself. We need more female protagonists to be sure, but we need to respect them enough to think we can make new characters for them rather than simply seapping out a chromosome of an existing one. Thats not equality, thats just lazy."
