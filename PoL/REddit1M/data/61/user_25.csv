9174,"I think it would be a good move, but I'm not angry about it or anything. Link has always been a blank slate character. You can change his or his horse's name to ""I am a girl"" so why not just make it another choice in order for the player to insert him or herself further into the game? "
31255,"That's true. I suppose getting rid of naming your character is inevitable when and if a game has voice-acting. 

It makes me sad there's no naming Link but I vastly prefer this over something like the voice-acting dialogue strategically avoiding saying your name... 

I'll add that choosing your gender would preserve some of that player agency and would just require recording separate dialogue for pronouns. But that's neither here nor there. "
