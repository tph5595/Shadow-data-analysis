I don't think gender swapping both Ganon and Zelda would be a good move though.  I agree on the Zelda main character as well, that could be cool if executed well."

Yeah, like his androgynous and sometimes feminine physical features."

I imagine if it ever happened, it would be considered an abnormality even to the characters in the game.  That's the only thing I would be concerned about though.  It would make sense for some characters to mention it, but if the topic of a female Link kept being put on the forefront in game, it would feel like it's just a cheap stunt.

Saying it doesn't make sense because it goes against the precedent they've set is about a strong as argument as saying that gathering/open-world Zelda doesn't make sense."
