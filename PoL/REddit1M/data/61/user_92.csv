30481,"Honestly, I don't understand any of the hate coming from either side of the for/against female Link. Personally, I wouldn't mind it either way, as long as A) The game is good, and B) It was a choice made on behalf of the creators and not the vocal minority.

But from a storytelling standpoint, the want for a Zelda-saves-Link game really has to be tackled. In the current state of the Zeldaverse, there is a reason that Zelda is a ""damsel in distress"". I'm also here to assert that she is not a typical damsel due to her role in the grand scheme of things.

There is a reason Zelda is always the target of Ganon time and time again. She has the triforce of wisdom, and that accounts for her role as a leader of her people and her kingdom. When Ganon takes that away, he has no other obstacles (barring Link and the triforce of courage) to taking over her kingdom, like he has. Over. And over. And over.

It would make sense that the ambassador of power (Ganon) would seek it out and make Zelda a target. Does this mean she is to automatically be a distressed individual? Not so. She has *some* power, (light arrows, songs, etc.), but her true power is leadership and dominion. *Leadership and dominion alone cannot stop a powerful tyrant from overthrowing her*. And if she WAS powerful enough to stop Ganon, she would also be powerful enough to subjugate her people with no opposition. Therefore, Ganon is the balance to prevent this from happening.

And inversely, Link is the agent of courage preventing Ganon from being all-powerful, and protecting Zelda from his evil. It's the cycle.

Zelda. Is. Not. A. Damsel. In. Distress."
