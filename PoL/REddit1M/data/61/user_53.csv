14731,"Can literally nothing in this world just exist without being genderbent to fuck? I am a gay man. I'm all for equality. But enough is fucking enough. Not every fictional character has to eventually have a genderbent version. There doesn't NEED to be a female Doctor. There doesn't NEED to be a female Link. There doesn't NEED to be any of this bullshit. When is enough enough? Link is a male character, and there's nothing sexist about that. What IS sexist, is insisting he MUST be female in order to fill your shitty ""feminist"" agenda. Feminism is about equality. Feminism isn't ""Let's change everything that represents the human male and change it to represent the human female.""

There are PLENTY of female protagonists in video games nowadays. And the number just keeps getting higher. Instead of changing what already exists, simply CREATE something new. We don't need a female Link. What we NEED is more games with female protagonists such as Chell from Portal, Samus from Metroid, and Lara Croft from Tomb Raider. How would you feel if all of a sudden I said, ""Hey, let's make a Tomb Raider where Lara Croft is a male?""

Immediately, I'd be called sexist. But for some reason, when the shoe is on the other foot and ""feminists"" (Again, using quotation marks here because a real feminist stands for equality, and not for this BS) want to change a pre-existing male character to a female, somehow that isn't sexist and is A-OK. I call bullshit. It's all bullshit."
15015,"RPG elements =/= RPG. The story is linear, and the characters are set. There's virtually zero reason to allow the player a choice in gender when Link has always been a male character."
15559,"Except the ""Legend"" in this case IS verified. In literally every fucking Zeldas game in all of existence. In this canon, the story ISN'T a Legend once you reach the end. It's true. According to the canon, Link has always been reincarnated as a male. Does that mean he can't be reincarnated as a female? No, not necessarily. But let's be real. If Link ever becomes a female in a future installment, it's not because the creators intended him that way. It's to appease this PC bullshit that has everyone on the internet ""offended"" over something they should never have been offended by in the first place."
33757,That virtually doesn't make any of what you said RIGHT. Taking away from someone else (I.E. Young boys) for the sake of giving it to someone else (Young girls) isn't the solution. Why can't you grasp that Link being a male can still exist while creating NEW franchises to praise strong female leads? Making him a female just sends a message to boys/men that there's something wrong with being male. When does equality take one step too many and start pushing itself back into inequality but the other direction?
