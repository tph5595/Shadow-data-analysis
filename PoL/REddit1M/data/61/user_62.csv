18693,"finally, now people can shut the fuck up arleady

if you want a female character, wait for a game that has a female main character, how about that?

what's with retards trying to turn a male character into a female one?

how about female nathan drake? how about female master chief? how about female crash bandicoot (oh wait, he's dead anyway).

How about a male Faith? How about male Samus Aran? Or male Lara Croft?

No? good, then shut the fuck up already, you dumb imbeciles"
