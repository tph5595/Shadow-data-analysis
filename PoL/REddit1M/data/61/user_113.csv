42242,Idk: a well-done female incarnation of Ganon would be pretty damn interesting.
42403,"I saw a lot of comments like ""female link would ruin the series forever!"", ""SJWs are ruining the world!"" so yeah, from my perception the anti-female link crowd is a lot more ""angry"" than the people who think it would be fun/interesting..."
42745,I also don't understand why people are getting so angry/defensive over the mere *idea* that link could be female. I mean: he's already been a wolf and a bunny ¯\_(ツ)_/
79979,"Plus, you can change Link's name in every game, which is also a meaningless choice, and people don't get upset over that?"
