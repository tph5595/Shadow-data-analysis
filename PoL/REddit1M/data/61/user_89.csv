29560,"Because why not? Like, I love Zelda, it's probably one of my favorite series, but it's not like 'Link' has a super strong character behind him. Plus considering stuff like WW showing the literal point was 'Link' wasn't one dude but rather the concept of the hero that rises against darkness, why not have one of those be a lady?

I don't think many are that 'mad' about it, more annoyed, especially considering last I checked the reasoning for it has been pretty spotty. Like in that 4 player co-op that wasn't 4 Swords it was 'well you can put on a dress' which makes it like 'so then what's the fuckin harm in making one a lady?' and then in this one it was something about the 'story' requiring it when they made a big point of saying how little backstory there was to start with and all.

It's less 'fuck you Nintendo you suck' and more 'why do game companies CONSTANTLY act like 'maybe one can be a chick' is some kinda crazy request'. It's not just Zelda it's Zelda on top of shit like 'no female Assassins because programming a female model is hard' and all."

link is a fictional character that has as part of his core story multiple different versions of 'him', including multiple storylines where the entire point is 'Link' is less a literal person and more an ideal of a hero."
29877,"&gt; How would you feel if all of a sudden I said, ""Hey, let's make a Tomb Raider where Lara Croft is a male?""

Imagine you have two bowls of candy. One is overflowing full and one has about a handful in it. If you take one candy from the overflowing bowl and put it in the near empty one, the near empty one can instantly recognize the addition, but the overflowing one hardly loses anything at all, right? 

Taking from the near empty one and putting it into the overflowing one is the exact opposite, the near empty one very clearly is now missing a piece, but the overflowing one having one more in it can barely even be noticed.

It's that but with roles. This applies to all kinds of media too."

34507,"Do you seriously not get that the point of the analogy is that it was said in response to 'oh well if I say make Lara Croft a man I'm sexist suddenly'? Because a female character made male takes away from a group that has less for a group that has more, and all that jazz?"
36012,"you are by far one of the most dense people on the internet, congrats."
37059,Link IS known for his sick guns
37773,"I mean they are 'actively' keeping it from people in the sense that they're the ones who, you know, make the decisions and are in charge of the design of the fictional character."
39112,"why can't they just write it like every other Zelda game, but for a woman?

Like, there's not a ton of gendered language to begin with, we're literally talking about switching pronouns. There's literally nothing that implies the 'hero of time' or whatever meta-title he has these days has a gender at all"
106448,And how does making him a woman change that
