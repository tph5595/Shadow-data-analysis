21646,You're effectively replacing a critical role and character of the game with what is effectively an Avatar.  His character is the reincarnation of the spirit of the Hero not some average Joe you can customize and project yourself onto. 
21848,Did you play a Link to the Past?  Did you not gather that he is part of the bloodline of the Hylian Knights?  The back story and his specific role in it all get portrayed through Sarhasrala and the 7 maidens trapped in the crystals. 
24540,"I was merely pointing out that saying all you had to go back on what that you are some random dudes nephew was pretty inaccurate.  There's a lot more to it, Nintendo isn't going to spoon feed you all the details, you have to put some effort into finding it. "
35889,Does that rich back story require Zelda to have a Vagina.  I'm assuming that having Zelda be a dude would cause any heartburn whatsoever right?
36322,"While we're add it, let's make Mario Female and Peach a dude.  Why don't make Samus your traditional male bounty hunter as well.  While we are at it why don't we make Donkey Kong into an actual Donkey instead of an ape.  The point I'm making is that we have have characters that Nintendo has made minor tweeks to over the years, but haven't completely fucked with just for the sake of appeasing Americas incessant hard-on for doing something politically correct."
