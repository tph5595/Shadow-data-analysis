6137,"While I don't think you will be able to customize Link's appearance in this game, it still hasn't been explicitly disconfirmed AFAIK.

That being said, I haven't watched all the Treehouse gameplay so if they said that there would be no customization, then that's that!

EDIT: Yup;  more concrete ""no"" was given. Female Link actually disconfirmed for reals. I'm guessing further customization has been discredited!"
10308,Yup :( (Note: Keep in mind that was after recursion8 made their post.)
