Really, I can only think of maybe one or two that actually do anything to reinforce that.  But if your logic for ""most certainly hinted at"" is nothing more than ""boy saves girl therefore they must be in love"" you're really reaching."
12640,"Basically, you're saying to refuse to acknowledge that a FemLink could have *male* characteristics to make her somewhat androgynous?"
13749,"&gt; Link isn't, in every game he has a strong back story

Okay, let's see:

* Minish Cap - You have no backstory other than ""blacksmith's grandson""
* Link to the Past - You have no backstory other than ""random knight guy's nephew""
* Legend of Zelda - You have no backstory whatsoever
* Ocarina of Time - You were a kid dropped off in a forest in the middle of a war, but nothing about that establishes a strong backstory as a boy
* Wind Waker - You're a random old lady's grandson
* Twilight Princess - You're a random person that lives in the woods

Actually, link has no backstory whatsoever, nevermind a ""strong"" one.  The only games where he does are sequel games like Majora's Mask, Adventure of Link, Link's Awakening, and Phantom Hourglass."

23473,"Care to explain? Some of the games give a back story for a previous Hero, but I can't think of any non sequel where you know anything about Link other than very basic facts like those listed. "
35806,"And none of that ""rich back story"" requires a penis. "
