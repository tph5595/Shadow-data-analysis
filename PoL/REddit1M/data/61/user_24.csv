They stated that they thought it would be a better idea to make Zelda the protagonist instead of a lazy gender swap, but they couldn't yet find a narrative that would fit for her without Link not being apart of it."
8348,"Him being being female would completely defeat the point of him looking androgynous though. At that point he would just look like and be a girl. The whole point is to make him look a male yet have female features. If he's a female with female features, then he's not androgynous, he's just a girl. The ironic thing about the whole situation is that if Anouma never told people this Link's gender back at e3 2014, no one would have known whether he was male or female, which is the whole point."
8764,"He does though, that's the whole reason why Anouma had to explicitly stated Link's gender back at e3 2014. When the game was first revealed, people legitimately thought Link was a girl, which is what caused the whole uproar in the first place.

Also: ""partly male and partly female in appearance; of indeterminate sex."""

They wanted to give Zelda the main role but they couldn't figure out what to do with Link and since Link is essentially the main character, so they decided to drop it. It doesn't mean they won't explore it again. It seems the Zelda team shares my thoughts that it would be a lot more meaningful to give a well established female character in the franchise a leading role instead of just gender swapping. It wouldn't be hard to imagine a scenario like GTA V style LoZ where Link, Zelda, and someone else each had there own objective's throughout the story and you could switch between characters."
