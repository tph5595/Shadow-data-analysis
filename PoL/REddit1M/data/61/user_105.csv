36291,"&gt; Over on NeoGAF people are mad as hell that there is no female link.

GAF is an SJW hellhole."
36323,"No, Link is a character.  A male character."
36356,"&gt; Because why not?

No upper body strength."
36431,"Nope, Link is Link, and Link is male."
37015,It's not an argument.  It's a fact.
37436,Why would the Spirit of Courage pick a girl?
37733,They're weaker.
38211,A girl of similar stature would have almost no muscle mass.  How would she even lift a sword?
39095,"Link's physical feats aren't *that* cartoonish, except when magic is involved. Otherwise, Link is pretty grounded.

If he were a female, though, it would be straight-up cartoon.

&gt; Dark Souls has female player characters just as capable of playing through the game as male characters, and you don't see anyone complain about that.

That's because the people who would complain don't play female."
42595,"Nintendo series are about iconic characters.  Otherwise, why not just replace Link with a Mii?

Dividing Link into the actual character and a non-canon female version weakens him.

Zelda already exists for those who need a woman to relate to, even if she isn't playable."
42768,So you need to start the game with the Power Glove if you play as female link.
42872,That's a lot for a small girl.
43452,"&gt; We're talking an adult, physically fit female here.

Bigger than Link, or around his proportions?  Because a woman his size is going to be petite as fuck.

&gt; Not to mention it's a video game.

If it's a videogame, why not give Link three arms, so he can carry more things at once?

Because suspension of disbelief.  Women exist in the real world, and they are weaker than men.  That is why they are women, and men are men.

Also, Link himself is inspired by Miyamoto's excursions as a boy, in the woods near the home of his youth.  If a woman was inspired to make things like that, Link might have been conceived as a girl.  He wasn't, though."
