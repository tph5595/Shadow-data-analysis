66751,"Nah, I'm a girl and it's never been less immersive in all the years I've played Zelda (can't say if that's the same for other girls though.) I actually would like it more if there was a game with Zelda as the main character. Instead of making Link female, it would be cool to see Zelda as the hero who has to use wisdom to save Hyrule. "
98886,"Any other game where a female is the main character. Personally, whether the character is male, female, black, Asian, etc, doesn't feel less immersive. But once again, that's just me and what I like.

To me, since it would change nothing about the story to make Link female, I don't see why they should do it. It would be an interesting change and I couldn't care less if they do it or not. But I'm more interested in seeing the point of view of Zelda (the awesome main female character who's proven to be really cool).  "
