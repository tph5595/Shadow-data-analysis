52772,Is Link even a male name though?
53242,"My view on this issue is pretty damn simple. As the oldest child I'd play games and get asked ""can I play as a girl?"" and the answer was always no, so you tell me a Zelda game where I can say ""yes"" that's great right?

So when I see a bunch of adults going all mental over an issue that is in my mind something that would be there for childen I just don't get it.

Like sure if I played thru the game a 2nd time I might try the female character option for the sake of variety, but like I really don't care if the game is good."
53368,"Agreed, the fact people are going mental over this is just weird to me. I feel like the only people who should care this strongly about this are young girls.

Like I just don't get how people are so upset over this not happening. Hell I don't get why some people are so, so happy it didn't happen either.

&gt; People will be upset whatever they do.

Those are the kind of people nobody should listen to.

This was not the discussion I expected to be having when I woke up this morning..."
53728,Well Alex is a gender-neutral name and honestly Link sounds like one too.
53997,"I'd honestly not be surprised if they game's dev team is completely unaware of this ongoing argument about female Link that has been occuring on western websites.

I hope someone asks Aonuma about it. I'd not be surprised if he has very little to say about it."

Oh and how I hope she would."

Remember this is the same company that didn't consider Minecraft an important IP."

Pokemon added it for a reason, it is a feature that is popular with the younger demographic.

And even in a game skewed at older audiences like whilst Mass Effect 82% of players played as male Shepherd, obviously there was a group of people who appreciated the choice.

Anyways its not happening so I don't really care."
