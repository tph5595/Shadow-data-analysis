19623,"""video games shouldn't be made with a female audience in mind or else it's pandering"" is about all I'm hearing here. "
20028,"Hey, in literally every fucking presidential race in all of existence men have won. According to the canon, the president has always been male. If the president is ever a female it's not because she deserved it it's just to appease PC bullshit. 

Do you see how this argument falls apart a little bit? It's never been confirmed that link has to be male, and for almost their entire existence video games have been made with men as the only audience. Since the audience is changing so much, what would be wrong with changing how you present the game? Adding something into a game that appeals to someone other than white males isn't pandering to PC bullshit, it's just trying to be inclusive and honestly is a pretty good business decision. "
20089,You don't sound very over it 
20321,If you think Lara Croft wasn't created with a male audience in mind you're kidding yourself. And I never said putting in female characters is the only way to appeal to women
