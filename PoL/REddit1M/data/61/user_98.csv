A peculiarity of Link, as well as other characters, is the several different incarnations of the person throughout the Legend of Zelda series. He is implied to be somewhat sleepy or lazy at first since at some point near the beginning of every game except the first two and Tri Force Heroes, he is sleeping or dozing off.

Since Link is not usually shown to speak, his personality is mainly determined by his actions or others' comments about him. It is shown that Link possesses basic characteristics found in a heroic character; bravery, selflessness, compassion, wisdom, and kindness. He would even goes as to save others that were his former enemies. These characteristics (along with his purity) allow him to wield the full Triforce in some of the games without a problem.

He is also loyal towards the ones close to him. This is frequently shown in each series, as he protects Zelda and others from any evil that threatens them without hesitation.
