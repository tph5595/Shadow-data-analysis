Of course they don't have to do it, but if Nintendo chose to make that an option, I would totally support it and it would make a lot of people happy."
11392,"How would it be bad writing? Nothing about the generic ways npcs treat him would be different if he was a different gender. The only personality traits Link has are being brave, and in some of the recent ones, occasionally being awkward or goofy, nothing that's tied to him being a dude.

If you don't think having a female option is a good idea because you believe Link just should be only a guy, then say that, but lets not pretend Link is some extremely fleshed out, fully contextualized well written character because he's not. In most games (save maybe Skyward Sword), you could swap out the model and pronouns in a few dialogues, and the game would be exactly the same."
11684,"Seriously people just jumping through mental hoops to justify something so trivial to the core experience. I think it's just because some people hear adding women to a game and they think ""uh oh pc police forcing diversity down our throats!""

For the sake of canon, Link has also had a hat in every game, to the point where it's been a plot point in multiple games, but it looks like he won't have one at all here, and has a ponytail now too.

I don't see anyone complaining about the canon or consistency of his image in this reincarnation."

But yeah, it looks like Aonuma's clarified there won't be a female link, so its a bit of a moot point. I just think all the people saying that one would break the canon are being a bit silly. They've already made a female hero Linkle who is essentially female Link. They could have an incarnation of her be the hero of a future game, I think that would be pretty cool personally."
