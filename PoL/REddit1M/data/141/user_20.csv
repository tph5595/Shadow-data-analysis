15090,"I thought the DLC was good for what it was.  I greatly enjoyed all three parts plus the motorcycle.  The best boss and divine beast were featured, and some of the better shrine content was in this DLC as well.  I had a ton of fun with the first portion, using the one shot weapon (I forget what it was called) was a really fun idea and the fake out combat shrine was a highlight of the whole thing.  OTOH, refighting the four blight ganon boss fights was frankly lazy and terrible, the DLC would have flat out been better without it.  

I think the real issue is what we expected. What we wanted was something that greatly expanded on what BotW was, and we wanted story content that was sorely lacking in the base game.  Instead, we got more of the same type of content that was already in the base game, and what's more, it wasn't even anywhere new.  If there was a new region that unlocked with all of this content, it coulda still been 10/10.  Instead, it was quests, shrines, and a new dungeon populating a map that most have already pretty much explored.  It's the type of content I've seen other games release for free, with the dungeon/boss at the end being worth a little extra, maybe $5.

We spent $20 on two content packs that should have, at most, been $10 total.  This and false expectations about really getting to explore Hyrule's past leads to this feeling lacking.  What is there is good mostly, but it needed more.

7/10. DAMN."

91345,"I have no idea what they were thinking pricing this at what they did, and although I still enjoyed it, I won't be purchasing a season pass from them upfront again.  I'd like to think Nintendo isn't the type of company to monetize with overpriced DLC but this proved me wrong.  There are amiibos, but there's a lot of debate on their worth still since its a fair priced physical item that has DLC attached in perhaps a tone deaf way.   

For $20, we ideally should have gotten a third of the content that was in the base game, or more realistically, a 4th since DLC usually (and fairly) comes at a premium price since the purchasing base is strictly those who own the game.  I'd even settle for a 5th since BotW is massive.

This was a fraction of the content in the base game.  It added a solid amount of dungeon-ish content (think about the base game's 20 combat shrines and 30ish blessing shrines, leaving about 70 unique puzzle shrines.  16 added to that ain't bad), and that dungeon content was great, but very little else.  No new map, no new towns, no new enemy types, no new weapon classes, just more dungeon content and a new boss.  Compared to exemplary DLC like what The Witcher 3 got and it just isn't good enough."
