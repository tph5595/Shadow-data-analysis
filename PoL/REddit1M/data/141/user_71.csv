36658,Unlike the original game this DLC made me appreciate how devastating the original loss to calamity Ganon was. So many dead Hylians and the champions were not a bunch of strangers to Link but his friends. This made BOTW seem like the saddest Zelda Iâ€™ve played. I really enjoyed the whole thing and playing it in master mode will be really challenging!
