25022,"To be honest, it was such a let down I wonder if I will ever finish it.

I started a master quest mode months back with the expectation that it would be my ""real"" playthrough; but I was also counting on DLC 2 to be something that really inspired me to get back into the story.

Instead its basically just more challenge maps. As a huge fan of this game, and I would legit call it my GOAT, this DLC was a massive let down. "

Thats not how buying things works. 

You are allowed to have expectations and be disappointed when the product doesn't deliver. "
