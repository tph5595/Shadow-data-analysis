20035,"I enjoyed it but kind of did a bone head thing with the yiga clan.  I got the orb of the hideout and for some reason had it in my head that i needed to take it all the way back to the guerdo town.  When i tried to get the orb out of the main ""pit"" area, i thought that it was a bit much needing to use the octo balloons to get it out, but I thought whatever, and then preceded to walk link with his happy orb all the way to Riju.  I got to her and she didn't do anything with it and popped open the quest menu to see that i just had to throw it down the hole...

I teleported back to the hideout and the orb was just in the first room sitting on the table, so I had that going for me. "
