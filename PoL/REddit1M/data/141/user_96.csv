2307342,"Just beat it about 10 minutes ago on Master Mode with everything done except Korok seeds. I expected the DLC to take place after defeating Ganon. I expected AT LEAST going with Zelda to see what the fuck is up with that Divine Beast that ""stopped working.""

Instead, we got more trials? After doing 120 shrines, freeing the divine beasts, doing the Master Trials = Link has to do more trials? I admit the 2 minute cutscenes were cool, I guess. "
