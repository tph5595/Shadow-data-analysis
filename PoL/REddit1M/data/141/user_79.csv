47562,I mean if anything got anyone's hopes up it was the $20 price tag and what that buys you elsewhere.

When you compare to some of the expansions that $20 buys you I guess they're just relying on the Zelda name to sell?"
93443,"Nintendo's first DLC outing with Mario Kart 8 was insanely good, its been sad to see how quickly things went downhill with their paid DLC. BotW has been particularly bad value and it double stings as BotW DLC had so much potential.

Also kind of blows they took it in a completely different direction to what they described it as in advance. I mean I knew better than to believe they'd have good storytelling in the DLC all of a sudden. But still reusing the same not very good bosses again is lame, and well more of the same is not what I wanted in a game that I stopped playing because I'd burnt out on it.

Hell even the way the cycle has a fuel gague is like ""have fun... but not too much fun"".

Up until now I've been pretty forgiving of BotW purely on the grounds that it is an absolutely fantastic 10/10 first attempt and laid down an amazing template to build stronger content on, but at this point I'm getting awful nervous they don't have any plans to do anything of the sort. I hope my pessimism on this one is unwarranted. "
