16938,"I thought the Yiga clan part was gonna be a huge pain in the ass, but I actually breezed by it within two minutes. I could be wrong, but I think they made it WAY easier the second time around. It felt like there were way less guards. (I also used some smeaky revali’s gale tricks to get up to where the orb was) "
17176,"There was a small part of me that felt a little bit disappointed by the DLC, but I quickly realized that it just simply wasn’t what I expected. I thought it was going to be a story driven DLC that would focus entirely on traveling around learning even more about zelda, and the champions. Hell, I thought you were gonna travel WITH Zelda as a sort of epilogue. Turns out the DLC was the exact opposite. It was a puzzle driven DLC, and boy did they deliver on that aspect. The puzzles were so much fun. They were challenging, thought provoking, and they tested your resourcefulness. I got legitimately stumped on a few of the new puzzles, and that doesn’t happen too often to me in a zelda game. I was really impressed. Overall, I had a lot of fun with it, and I’m kinda mad at myself that I expected something crazy, when I really should have just not thought about it, and enjoyed whatever they chose to deliver. "
29600,"Yeah but purchasing a form of entertainment is different. I think too many people set themselves up for disappointment by expecting something crazy, and then grtting somethig different, but equally good in return. That’s what made Breath of the Wild so fun for me. I wasn’t expecting or predicting ANYTHING. Sure, I thought there were gonna be temples, and dungeon items and whatnot, but I wasn’t pissed when I didn’t get that. Matter of fact, I was surprised, and even happy when I got something completely different. "
29648,"I originally thought of doing that, but I figured they’d send in like 20 of them all at once to gang up on you. Is that not what happened? "
108980,"True. To be fair, I thought it would have been better if we explored more of Zelda amd the champions too, but i’d rather not get negative about that. I’d rather just enjoy what they DID give me, rather than lament about what they DIDN’T give me. But either way, I agree. "
2315926,"I thought the same exact thing was gonna happen. I was really looking forward to traveling around with Zelda. I was a little pissed when I discovered it’s basically the opposite. Sure, it would’ve been cooler to have a story driven DLC, but to be fair, they did make some pretty impressive puzzles. Ultimately, it had a bitter taste at first, but I rolled with it and ended up having a lot of fun. "
