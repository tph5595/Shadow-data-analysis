22428,It's garbage. It's difficult to control and it uses fuel. But the worst part is you don't even get it until you beat the DLC so I have no incentive to use it since there's nothing left to play.
24022,It has a fuel gauge that drains pretty fast and when it runs out you have to get off the bike and fuel it up. I think anything in your inventory can be used as fuel. I filled it up with some moblin horns the other day.
32452,It's just inconvient. I've got plenty of spare resources for fuel but I don't want to get off and fuel up.
