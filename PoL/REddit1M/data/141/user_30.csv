I go into the first blight Ganon fight with a surplus of supplies, and didn't have that for that fight - and all four were like that, whereas I fully use the master sword for the remaining 3.

But say all you want, I think the final boss fight of the DLC was the best in the game, and it was so different than all of the other fights. Honestly, the final boss was the high point of the game for me."
