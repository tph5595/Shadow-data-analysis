99100,"How far did you get into it? It doesn't sound like you got past the first section.

The DLC has three sections to it, the first being challenge map-esque (and my personally least favorite). The second gives you a dozen new side quests + shrines to complete, plus you have [re-hashed boss fights](/spoiler). The third is by far the best, with [a new dungeon and a new boss fight](/spoiler). It takes a bit of time to get to the best stuff, but I highly recommend doing it; my opinion is that they are the best of the whole game."
