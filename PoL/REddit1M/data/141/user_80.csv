49070,That's final boss was one of the easiest for me in the game. Probably around a minute. I only ever saw him use like 1 attack... I guess I should do the fight again and wait him out to see his potential. I didn't get the full experience rushing and speedrun the boss... Hmm
49218,I had a whole trip where I drove from the Akkala research lab to the Gerudo Desert entrance while only refueling near stables! My fuel was whatever got in my way during the journey! It was really fun :)
