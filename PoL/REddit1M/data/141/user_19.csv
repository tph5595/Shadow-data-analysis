14957,"The main problem I see right now is that BoTW is a Wii U game. While it is not unprecedented for Nintendo to release additional DLC long after the original promised offerings (Hyrule Warriors got all the Legends characters about 16 full months after its original season pass ended), I sadly think that this is it for the Wii U. They're not going to intentionally tick off Wii U owners, as they promised back in March that ""Both versions of the game offer the same content"", and e3 2016 was entirely focused on the fact that the Wii U was getting the complete version of the upcoming Zelda game.  

At this point I'm expecting a new Zelda Game on Switch circa late 2019 using the BoTW engin. (Operating under the assumption that Aonuma et al. are working on something Zelda-related right now, because they always are, AND that the dev time will be a bit shorter, because of reused assets like Majora's Mask, Spirit Tracks, and Tri Force Heroes)."
