16880,"&gt;	My only real gripe was re using the blight ganons as bosses. The limited supplies were a neat idea but recycling them in paid DLC feels a little lazy. 

Especially if you were like me and had to speed run 3 of the divine beasts just to start the dlc. I guess it was kind of fun to fight the blight Ganons without my OP gear though."
