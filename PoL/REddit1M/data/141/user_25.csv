You're reliving the past trials and challenges of the champions, and succeeding where they failed, to prove you're the true hero. What I thought while playing through it, which would have been really cool, would be if you got to actually play as the champions during the flashbacks. But the MASTER CYCLE ZERO more than made up for that gripe."
