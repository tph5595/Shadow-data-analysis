30701,"I think it was the right idea executed poorly. Something they could have done is put the new story quest in the neighboring regions of each Beast. Lanayru Sea/Necluda Sea for Mipha's quest. Gerudo Highlands for Urbosa. Akkala for Daruk. Hebra for Falco. I picked those specifically because those are (sub/)region you don't even need to touch to beat the base game. That would have given those regions some substance. Also the way DLC armor is acquired could have been better like putting the phantom Ganon armor on different beefed up bokoblin camps. There are so many structures that have no purpose that could have been given purpose and this is just one example. Give some of the NPC's more involvement. That sibling pair trying to get the Gerudo treasure could be implemented into the armors as well. They're always looking for treasure but they never find any or point you toward any. They should have been involved in side quest. You are constantly saving them, maybe they hands you something as thanks and also hire you to escort them somewhere seeing Link's fighting prowess. You get them to They treasure and it turns out the don't want it and sell it to you. Anyway so many missed opportunities"
