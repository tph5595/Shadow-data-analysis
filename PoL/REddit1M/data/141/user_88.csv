Maybe I am alone in this but I really wished that it directed you to go to hyrule castle and beat Gannon one last time to truly rid the world of calamity. I really just wanna run around and explore a lively hyrule castle. Hopefully something like this will come in the future, if not it will still be my favorite video game. "
