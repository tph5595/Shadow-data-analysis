I would have liked to see them add more optional shrines as opposed to adding one's that are required by the story. Just having some pop up in places after the main quest would have given the player something to do with the motorcycle. 

I'm playing a file where I've done most of what there is to do. So I've finished the beasts, the shrines, gotten the memories, finished most of the side quests and upgraded the gear I want to upgrade. So, once it's done and I have this dope bike there's no much more for me to do, which is a real bummer. So having a few more shrines appear (enough to round out the hearts, say) would have been a real treat. 

But, I've also been itching to start over (in Master Mode) and I'll just play the game with such an end goal in mind. Get the beasts and leave the shrines. 

But here's to even more DLC so the adventure never stops!"
