2113,"I had a similar experience, I hadn’t played the game in a few months so I was glad to get more out of it but I was hoping for something more story driven and did feel a bit bogged down with shrines towards the end. 

I took a break halfway through to finish the Master Trials because I’d only gotten up to the Final set. Coming out of those I felt like I could beat anything without difficulty so it was great to get that final boss that shook things up. 

Overall I had a really good time I just hoped we’d be seeing a bit more closure on the story or maybe some more events from 100 years ago. "
14108,"I agree, especially since the bundle of both DLCs was advertised as an Expansion Pass rather than a season pass per se"
15428,"It’s a lot more fun than the horse because you can maintain speed, but some think the handling is a bit off and it can be hard to turn. I didn’t really use horses through my entire playthrough because I preferred to run and climb everything, the bike seems like a much better convenience and it’s a good reward for the effort you put into the DLC. "
16247,"Yeah, you get them from the initial trial of 4 shrines on the Great Plateau, the Champion’s shrines offer tokens that you use to access the redone boss battles to upgrade their abilities. "
16332,"No problems at all, just keep driving with no damage taken, the bike is great for the Central map areas because they’re mostly flat with some slight hills. first thing I did was jump off the great plateau which is a fairly substantial drop and took no damage and the stayed on the bike. 


Edit: Apparently high enough falls make you take normal damage, but for smaller falls that would otherwise hurt you’re fine"
16552,"I didn’t realise until I was halfway through this DLC that Daruk’s Protection can be used for falls, I guess I wasn’t that creative for a while"
19825,"I didn’t know this but it’s good to know, at the very least you can take much bigger falls than you otherwise would be able to"
33447,"I sure do, 36 I think, I often have a session looking for them but eventually just give up and play something else, maybe having the bike will push me further in that direction but part of me never wants it to end and not finishing the shrines gives me that excuse "
34463,"I tend to do 2 or 3 before I give up, it’s partially out of the repetition of it but also because I want to keep having a reason to come back. "
41034,"I couldn’t give a bigger recommendation for any game really, the main game is one of the best I’ve ever played and kept me hooked like no game has in years, I envy that you’ve yet to finish it. I hope you have a great time with it!"
