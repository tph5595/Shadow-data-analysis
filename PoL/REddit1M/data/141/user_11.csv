11044,"The whole thing was worth it for that last dungeon which was the best one in the game, in my opinion. The gears and rotating locks made the whole thing feel more coherent than the others. It was like repairing a giant engine. I got a kick out of the boss fight and the banging theme for it.

My only real gripe was re using the blight ganons as bosses. The limited supplies were a neat idea but recycling them in paid DLC feels a little lazy. Something like this should be entirely new content.

Other than that though I had a lot of fun with it. Now I just need to zip around on the bike and find those last 500 or so koroks..."
11200,I didn't even know ancient arrows worked on anything other than guardians... TIL
142006,"Yeah, me too."
142468,"I had fun with the first one I did (waterblight) cuz I've never done it the ""right"" way before with the ice blocks. It took me 4 or 5 tries to get that one right but the rest were a breeze. Urbosa's fury kinda killed the challenge on them."
142704,"Yeah, which is why the dungeon was like repairing a giant engine. It was like you were ""fixing"" a divine beast which is how I think the others should have worked as well. It was the most creative one by far."
142831,"I refused to look it up and I had to throw myself at it quite a few times before I figured out the right method of doing it. All the other ones didn't require nearly as much thought or effort, unfortunately.

That music really got my blood pumping though. :)"
143034,"I agree, it was really the only fight in the game that had me constantly on my toes. And landing hits on him was so damn satisfying after he knocks you around a bit."
143126,I ran into the same problem. I cleared all the shrines while waiting for the DLC to drop thinking there would be much more content than there was. I still have a ton of koroks to find but I can't really see myself picking it up again any time soon just for that.
