46295,"My thoughts on it:
1. Cutscenes were incredibly good.  Definitely my favorite part.  Plenty of incredible animations like urbosa fighting, and mipha's was extremely touching and baby Sidon is the most adorable thing I've ever seen
2. Blight boss fights were eh.  I mean they were the same fights I'd already done so it was hard to get that excited by them.  Waterblight felt borderline impossible and not in a fun way
3.  The new shrines were almost all a lot better than most of the original shrines.  Just felt like more was put into them (which makes sense considering they had to make 120 shrines)
4. Last dungeon was by far the best dungeon in the game.  Really fun and challenging puzzles and took me a long time to finish
5. Final boss was also really fun.  Probably my favorite in the game
Overall I loved the dlc.  I hadn't played for months just because I had already done so much (105 shrines, explored almost all of the map, done every major quest), and this update successfully reignited my interest in playing this incredible game, so I can't complain about that.  Biggest problem for me was that the boss fights already didn't feel that unique since they were almost all ganon, so fighting the same 4 again was kind of boring.  Nevertheless, the positives definitely outweigh the negatives"
