A new weapon that we get to use for half an hour before the game takes it back forever, a few tasks for each place which always includes “run through the rings”, rematches with bosses we’ve already done that are now easier because we know how to fight them, quick little cutscenes for the Champions that the DLC is supposed to be about! a quick final “dungeon” with an annoying yet underpowered boss, and a bike. A bike with terrible controls that completely renders horses obsolete.


I bought the DLC the day pack 2 came out and tbh, pack 1 seems much better. The Sword Trials are a lot more worthwhile in my opinion, pack 2 is only really worth it for the new costumes."
