7155,dude...just use ancient arrows 1 per yiga clan member(3 in total) and that's it. I you get to shoot them before they blow the whistle you're good.
11882,Try them on lynels (single hit). This is very useful for the trials of the sword. 
17610,Yes. But on trial of the sword this is a better strategy against the lynels. Also if you’re in a life or death situation in game and you just want to get rid of the lynel. One ancient arrow and boom they’re gone.
