My friend is that way--he's already beaten most of the game including the shrines, so he has nowhere really worth going. At least I dropped the game before I finished the quests and shrines, so I can drive it around exploring and looking for shrines."

Same! But then, I guess that's not what Zelda games have been about. As much as I'd love to play in post-Ganon Hyrule, I don't think it'll happen. It would change so much about the map that they probably wouldn't want to do it."

That doesn't make the puzzles bad, it just makes them not what I wanted, and I can be annoyed with that and think they could have done it better."
