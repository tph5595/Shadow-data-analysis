1907,"I thought the whole thing was a really good challenge. The first part on the plateau was the hardest part. I needed to save A LOT. (Stasis+ is your friend) Sneaking back into the Yiga hideout was bullshit (I don't like 'stealth or die') but I  got through it. 

I struggled, but I didn't feel overwhelmed. It felt good to finally be able to use my full power on the final test. Loved the door puzzle with all the gears and stuff. Whole thing took me around 14 hours to get through."

18516,It took me three tries this time. Took me a lot more when stealing back the thunder helm. Had to look at a video to understand how it worked.

I was clueless fighting Waterblight Gannon. First time in, I had arrows galore and just destroyed it. This time around with 5 arrows? I had no idea how to beat it. I wasted one of my tridents by throwing one at it. Had to look up using Stasis on the ice blocks to figure it out. "
