30767,"Is it weird that I wanted the final divine beast to actually be...a beast? Have a name? Maybe get added to the final cut-scene? Be present on the map permanently?

Instead it's a semi-UFO-shaped thing that you never think about again when you leave it. It's odd to me that the final trial is framed as a Divine Beast and has the divine-beast-like interior but doesn't share the other traits of a divine beast. Feels like a cop out to me.
