53915,"This dlc was a bittersweet experience for me. Zelda has always been my favorite series and I've enjoyed breath of the wild so much that I completed it 100% twice and logged over 1000 hours. When I heard about the dlc I was extremely happy knowing that it wasn't over and they could use the existing assets to build onto the game. The extra shrines were complex and the dungeon was probably the best of the five but I expected more for a near perfect game. Getting more background on the champions was also interesting but it was the same context we initially had and it was done in the same memory format. The master cycle was also a great addition although it's comparable to my 13 star horse and getting it post dlc when you've completed everything doesn't get it much use. Considering the shrines, dungeon and cycle I enjoyed the dlc but the amount of potential and creativity it could've had coming from aounuma and the Zelda team makes it very lacking. They could've created a new story arc post ganon fight, added a new area to the map, interactions with Zelda, included new enemies, new weapons and so much more and that missed potential coupled with the 5 year wait until the next Zelda left me wanting more. 
One nitpick I have is the fact that we only got 4 additional spirit orbs to give us an extra heart or vessel. "
