Honestly, I was thinking Link would finally get the Triforce of Courage, especially since the boss mentioned courage in its dialogue after the fight. At first I thought that they would let you control the whole platform as a Divine Beast because of the camera shots after the boss and it starting unfolding. But then when I realized it was the motorcycle, the whole epic moment was ruined for me :/ 

I did start laughing though so they had that going at least."
