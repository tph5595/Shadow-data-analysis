35980,"I’ll be the first to say it:

The motorcycle makes zero sense. Hyrule is littered with shrines populated by one aging monk, who’s been in meditation for centuries just for the moment to pass on some of his power to make the hero stronger

Then we have these extra monks with **SUPER HARDCORE PUZZLES** in order for the hero to obtain a **TOTALLY BITCHIN’ BADASS MOTORCYCLE**. 

Don’t get me wrong, the puzzles were a blast, and the motorcycle is fun (albeit functionally useless by the time you obtain it). It just doesn’t seem to fit thematically. 

Story wise I feel mixed. I didn’t really care about the champions in the first place; they’re all kind of rehashed characters, and aren’t given enough screen time to start with. Having a DLC centered around them didn’t do anything to further that either, they still seemed mildly shallow, and it’s depressing since they die gruesome deaths anyways. 

I’m glad I played it, the final boss fight and final dungeon were a blast, but I would’ve liked to see it go a different direction story wise. "
