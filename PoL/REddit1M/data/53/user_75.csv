67704,"The Great Deku Tree in OoT is my least favourite part of the whole game; I'm not really sure why but I just don't like playing through it. Any collection section (goddess tears, triforce pieces, etc.) can be very tedious. I also didn't like having to defeat the imprisoned multiple times in SS; I found that in particular to be VERY annoying. "
