20737,"People complain about TWW's triforce quest, but it was honestly one of my favorite parts of the game. (It's the one part that feels truly ""open world"".)

Whereas Skyward Sword's song quest was a similar idea - late-game fetch quest forcing you to retrace your steps - but for some reason, I found it completely boring. None of it felt like it mattered. There's the annoying tadpole quest that the dragon makes you do for *no* justifiable reason, then a freak accident makes you go on a random stealth mission in Eldin, and then the part in Lanayru  desert... isn't quite as bad, actually. I've noticed that about Skyward Sword - all the desert parts are better than the equivalent parts elsewhere.

But yeah. Maybe not my least favorite part, but definitely in the bottom 5."
