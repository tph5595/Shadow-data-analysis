Also the amount of hidden objects &amp; places that need to be seen by the Lens of Truth made me always worried that I'd run out of green magic &amp; get stuck."
71713,"It's not even close to annoying if you play the 3DS version; there's 4 slots/buttons instead of 3 to use items from &amp; they can just be selected by touching their icons on the bottom screen.

My first experience ever in OoT was in the 3DS version, playing the original Majora's Mask afterwards on an emulator was a pain."
71840,How about the not-even-a-temple Great Bay Temple in Majora's Mask? That place was annoying &amp; I felt like I'm doing a fucking chore that is fixing the plumbing in a monster-infested hydro power station.
72180,"I agree that it was a bit *frustrating* but not annoying, in the first 3 days where you don't have the Ocarina you're required to do 2 simple tasks &amp; you're done half a day early even if you're as slow as a slug. Afterwards it becomes much easier once you play the Inverted Song of Time since it slows down time to about 30% (as I've heard) &amp; you can return to day 1 whenever you want by playing the Song of Time.

The time factor in Majora's Mask is what adds suspense to the story."
72469,"They weren't that bad, but what I hated is that the Woodfall Temple boss is easier to beat with normal Link wearing the Bunny Ears than with Deku Link, as opposed to the other bosses that have to be beaten while wearing the mask received right before entering their temples."
72635,"I know, right? It isn't even a temple to begin with, it's a fucking hydro power station where you must do the chore of fixing its plumbing. They could have made it instead a large sunken pirates ship, such wasted potential."
