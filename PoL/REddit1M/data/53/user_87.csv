104594,"Any minigame that involves archery. Maybe it's because I have bad aim, but whenever I replay a Zelda game to go for 100%, I dread having to do them. The ones that really stick out to me are the Gerudo Horseback Archery, both archery minigames in Majora's Mask, and shooting the pumpkins in Skyward Sword. The Horseback Archery I remember going through a full wallet of 500 rupees twice to get both rewards. This is mostly to blame for my bad aim, and the tight restriction to get 1500 or more. Speaking about tight restrictions, MM's archery games were ridiculous. You had to be perfect to get the heart pieces. If you shot a blue octorok on accident, you can kiss your slim chances goodbye. The swamp one isnt as bad, but you had to hit every target, and you need quite a bit of time to spare. The pumpkin throwing minigame should be relatively easy because you can point and shoot. It's a shame the remote constantly came out of sync. I also hated the pumpkins went random distances.  "
