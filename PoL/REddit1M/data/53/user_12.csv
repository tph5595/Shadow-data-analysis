5617,"Skyward Sword, the part when you have to collect the baby toads in the flooded forest, it was so tedious and boring that I stopped my (until that point) continuous playthrough for several days. I also disliked the Silent Realm bits, particularly the last one. When parts of the game become a chore instead of a fun experience is when you know a game failed (in my humble opinion) "
