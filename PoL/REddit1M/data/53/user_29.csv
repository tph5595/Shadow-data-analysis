12755,Oh dear lord. Never again. My sister and I can't even do the Twilit Realm in TP because of the hand that follows us. We were not meant for suspenseful things like this. 
12776,I actually loved the wolf parts. They were probably my favorite parts. 
12840,I had to get my sister to get just the Sun Song. Redeads = nope. 
12898,Fighting Girahim a dozen times. In his first form.

The games are becoming too friendly for new gamers, which I guess is good for new gamers, but makes it so tedious for anyone that knows how to use a joystick and a couple buttons."
