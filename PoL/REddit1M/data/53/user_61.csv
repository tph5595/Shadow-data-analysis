48089,"This.  THIS.  Wind Waker earned its position as my least favorite Zelda game because of this.  Getting the damned Triumph Forks was the single most tedious thing I've ever put up with in a game.  Took 3 years to finish that game because I'd get so aggravated at that point that I had to say ""maybe next summer."""
