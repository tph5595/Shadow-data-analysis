36869,"You can only optimize software so much.  Optimization doesn't magically make a game run perfectly after enough optimization is done, it's just something that makes a run a bit faster.  

Besides, there aren't frame rate drops or bad performance like that all the time and it only happens sometimes.  I've noticed it maybe once every hour or two (it isn't constant for sure), and it's never anything that affects playability (exploration, combat, etc.)."
