13263,Wish their console department would've taken a page out of that book.
13330,It could very well be a game bug causing framerate issues. Stuff like memory leaks or unneeded isometry and telemetry being loaded when it's not needed.
13385,The remaining 3-4 dungeons not in the game. :)
13469,"I think there are two issues:

1) Making the story too good would've detracted from the gameplay elements players praise the game for

2) Making the story too long or more indepth would've required more rails.

There is also the hidden third option, they missing story elements are in the DLC."
13566,"eh... It's one of the first heavily voiced Nintendo IPs, it's probably more a growing pain than anything else. At least it's not like the Tales of series where any VA has been dreadful for multiple iterations now."
13743,"No I was being facetious, because most Zelda games have about 8-10 dungeons. This game has 5 (Divine Beasts and Hyrule Castle). But it is plausible the DLC will include dungeons that replace a second half of the game we weren't aware of. Maybe the game was just supposed to be that big.
"
14041,"That means it wasn't develop according to the consoles that developer has complete access to. I mean the SSB4 literally disables bits of the 3ds' Operating System to perform correctly. The fact this game was developed for 5ish years (probably more like 3) and it performs awkwardly in all modes on the platforms it supports is a shortsighted decision by the developers. There is no need to defend this, the game is amazing even with the flaws. It's just disappointing."
14287,"I mean, I'm sure that was the thought process. Disperse the dungeons all throughout the world. 100 Shrines and 4 mini-dungeons (let's be fair divine beasts aren't all that big) definitely accounts for enough tile maps to be similar to 10-15 dungeons."
15956,"I mentioned in another post, the divine beasts are rather short in compared to some other zelda dungeons. But in the same breath they're also better designed than many other zelda dungeons (looking at you wind waker with your guided dungeons). 

I wouldn't be surprised if the dlc is added dungeons."
23018,"Poorly designed dock is probably the best assumption. It simply passes through the info rather than has it's own upscaler, which admittedly would've been more expensive.

It has to run at 900p, because that's what Nintendo said the Switch could run at. The reason they just didn't stick with 720p, is because that's nearly a decade behind current TV technology. And 900p sounds closer to 1080p for their market. It's a really dumb decision they didn't partner with intel or amd over nvidia to guarentee 1080p performance on both the tablet and dock, but I assume it goes back to price."

My comment is based on how a designer from nintendo would think. It's based on understanding what they were trying to do and how the game is designed. There are many elements to BotW that are hated, that while I don't like them I do get where the designers were going. Weapon durability, small dungeon design, etc. And trust me, I'm not a fan of them.

But you can't sit here and tell me that there aren't times when something is made very well where the designer then forgets to make other areas better.

Witcher 3 is an easy example here. When the story becomes extremely important, they lock other areas of the game from the player. Because that's how it's designed. To force the importance on the player they make it so you can't do it. They mask it by giving you the feeling of importance.

If BotW was to have a more important story, it's very plausible they would've locked off specific areas until you beat that stage of the story. So instead of being able to go to gerudo desert immediately after the plateau, you'd now need to go to Zora's Domain, and they'd gate it by giving a water based armor in Zora's Domain. And before going to Death Mountain you'd have to go to Gerudo to get X piece.

Zelda has actually done this in the past. BotW is very Anti-Zelda in  it's lackadaisical care of sequence-breaking. Something Fans of the Game Love."
70030,"Again, does a feature which tells you that you can't return seem like something breath of the wild would benefit from? 

Literally no element in the game currently does it. Do you see no detraction? 

Again you're creating a strawman on things I didn't say, and using them as the reason I'm wrong as if they logically prove that. 

Were talking high level design, just because you answer yes or no to any of these questions doesn't mean people like aonuma and others would agree. And without them to ask this is akin to a philosophical discussion. 

Now to specifically answer your Witcher question, the last third of the game is very strong armed into a direction at the cost of open world exploration, and yes they let the player know beforehand. But you're acting as if that fits breath of the wild from a design standpoint. The game vehemently acts against gamification outside of shrine trials. I don't see that design decision up and leaving just so the story could be better. I'd even go as far as to say doing so would make players less excited about story elements because of the rails it's introduce for the player. "
89350,"I mean as someone pointed out, Tales has hired some very well known VAs that are very good. They just mistaken bad scripts/directing as being not also a bad thing. "
