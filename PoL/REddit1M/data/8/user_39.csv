Or at least give us the option.  I've played a lot undocked in the last couple days and it plays fantasticly.  I just have a hard time understanding why it has these problems, when the CPU technically clocks faster once the system is docked.  Doesn't make a lot of sense to me."

In this game it's a lot more fun, for me, to explore and engage in combat in the overworld, so the shorter dungeons seem to fit with that.  And that's not even taking into account the shrines, which I've enjoyed quite a bit, although I do wish there was some variance in the themes of the shrines."
