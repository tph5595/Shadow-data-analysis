54633,"Not to mention (and I'll admit I might be alone here) re-releasing a great game that originally was on a console that's no longer supported, was a great idea. I personally still have a cube, but I had to keep my old TV for it because my flat screen would result in 3-5 second delays even in game mode. WWHD allowed me to play it for the first time and probably have the most fun with the Wii U since I bought it(Xenoblade X release)."
55896,"That should be the case, yes. But just taking a few examples, Nintendo has, in the recent past, stretched the limits of their consoles pretty far:

* Super Smash Brothers 3DS has pretty big load times, even on a New 3DS

* Pokemon XY have huge frame rate issues with 3D on and they even made it a point to not have 3D enabled on the over world. Pokemon Omega Ruby/Alpha Sapphire continue this trend.

* Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate runs well on New 3DS, but has some noticeable frame rate drops on older 3DS systems and even on the New 3DS it doesn't *always* run butter smooth. 

* Monster Hunter Generations seems to have the same issues as 4 Ultimate.

* Pokemon Sun and Moon straight up disabled the previously available in-battle 3D and still manages to slow the game to a crawl in double battles on New 3DS, possibly worse/more commonly on older models.

Now, I know those are all handheld examples, but I think it's noticeable that Nintendo has a tendency to push their hardware to its limits, sometimes too far. In Pokemon's case, it's clear that the battle models are designed for usage far in the future, as their polygon count exceeds the norm of the 3DS by quite a bit, but other games do it too and *those* aren't designed to throw out a new release every other year.

Note that I'm not a frame rate nut(I use this term jokingly, don't hurt me), in fact, I'm pretty ignorant about it as long as the game delivers in other aspects, but I do see the trend here.

EDIT thanks, oh bot of misspellings. lol"
