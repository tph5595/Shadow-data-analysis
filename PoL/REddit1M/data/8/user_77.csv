So obviously we can see that the development cycle is trending longer and longer, but (and I get that you're being tongue in cheek) I think it's super worthwhile to use BotW as the perfect example of Miyamoto's wisdom here.

When WWHD was announced in January 2013, they explained that ""Zelda Wii U"" was well into production, but taking longer than expected.  WWHD was described as a game to hold fans over ""in the meantime"" while they waited for what would become BotW.  Four years ago, they said that!  It is really crazy how long this game has taken when you think about the fact that some of the most beloved games in the series were completed much faster.  But, obviously: well worth the wait."
