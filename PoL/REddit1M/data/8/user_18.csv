I think they knew what the response would be based on that last minute delay, but at that point it was too late and not a large enough investment for them to overhaul it completely. "

Think of it this way. If they had a bigger investment in the title, it's not farfetched to see it be delayed to the Switch and overhaul the controls, expand the title out a bit and deliver a more traditional Star Fox game. But they needed titles for the Wii U since the lineup was already thin. Star Fox being what it is in terms of overall brand cache and sales, they did what they could and the game released as it was. The result wasn't a bad game, but it required a steep adjustment to the controls that a lot of players weren't willing to deal with. "
