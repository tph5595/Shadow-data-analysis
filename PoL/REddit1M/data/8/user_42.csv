""A delayed game is eventually good as long as your CEO has even the most basic idea of what he's doing or even wants to do, a rushed game is bad forever."""

At that point, they can't possibly delay long enough to make a good and *polished* game, so they settle for one or the other."
21042,"The frame drops are my only problem with the game.  The Wii U version goes below 30 *constantly*.

Fortunately, the rest of the game is a fuckin' masterpiece, so I can ignore it most of the time."
21090,"It's a bit of both.

One one hand, the game would obviously be way smoother if Nintendo's hardware wasn't always so mediocre.

On the other, it's not like the devs didn't know what they were working with.  They put all of the long draw distances, lighting, foliage, physics, etc. in the game anyway."
21724,"&gt;Yeah. They should've made the game bad but with better frame rate.

People can easily argue that frequent frame drops to &lt;1/2 of the target makes a game bad.  Everything has tradeoffs, and they chose to trade fps for other things.  Obviously not everyone is against that choice, but some are.  

But yeah, you're probably right.  Any change to improve FPS would obviously make the game *terrible*.  There is *no* middle ground."
