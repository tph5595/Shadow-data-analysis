11135,"Uhh, Starfox Zero?"
11174,I can't even really think of what they would add with DLC. Maybe more big optional dungeons?
12085,"If they just didn't force the motion controls it would have been a fun experience. I have nothing against motion controls but there are certain games where they should be forced because they are the feature (wii sports, 1-2 switch) and there are games where they *can* be included just fine without having to be forced. Starfox Zero was a game that didn't need to force those controls and the game suffered for it.

Starfox 64 3D included motion/gyro controls, but didn't force the player to use them, and it's the best SF game imo.

I'd love to see a reworked version of SFZero on the switch with different controls. That is a pipe dream that will most likely never happen though."
13537,What do you mean? Was there dungeons that were planned but not put in the game?!
13918,"That would certainly be cool. I've probably played 20 hours and haven't even gotten to the first big dungeon but the mini shrine dungeons are great. I've even been stumped on a few of them so far so I can only guess as to what awaits me in a real dungeon.

Wind Waker only had 4 or 5 dungeons if I remember correctly but yeah, coming off of TPHD which I believe holds the record, it's always nice to see more dungeons of course but I really don't feel cheated at all with the finished product."
37819,"I heard it was good, but I couldn't get past the horrible controls. I'd love to play it with a SF64 control style on the switch but I doubt that'll ever happen."
81778,Yeeeah that's not exactly what I was talking about when I said SF64 control style.
116733,Nah its just not the same. Go play Starfox 64 3D and you'll see what I mean.
