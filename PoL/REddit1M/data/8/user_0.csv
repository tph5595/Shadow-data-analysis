0,"In this era of unfinished games being released left and right, Nintendo once again proves that while we may wait a long time and have a lot of delays; the games are released finished. 

Sure, there are slight glitches and bugs but there isn't a game in existence that doesn't. It's the nature of programming. Obviously there are performance issues but they are not the games fault. But the game is complete and no major patches needed to make the game playable (enjoyable). 

Its always impressed me with Nintendo that their first party games just work. I hope this continues."
4796,Hey! I have twin 16 month olds. I know the feeling. They go to sleep at about 7:30 so from about 8 until about 11:30 is all Zelda! My wife is very understanding:) She uses it to catch up on her shows.
4839,Lackluster game but still 100% functional though. Nintendo seems to play test the shit out of games. And they aren't afraid to delay them either.
4885,"If you look at previews from the announcement, I'm glad they waited. They did a ton in those 2 years."
8170,That's why I said outside of performance issues. That's not a game bug or unfinished material. It's still 100% playable and I barely notice anymore. And I play on WiiU so it's a bit worse I guess.
8294,"And the outrage of hard mode? At first I agreed with the outrage. But now that so many enemies can one shot me no matter the hearts, I'm not sure what Hard Mode will do. Will every weapon break on one hit?"
8373,"I agree but (I know this sounds like I am an apologist, I'm sorry) I didn't expect this story to be amazing. It's Zelda. It never is. The lore is great, the humor is awesome. But the overall story arc is never great."
13616,"Lol ok, 2 shots:)"
13692,"Sure, but it sure seems system related. I mean the frame dips happen more when docked on Switch and when played on screen on WiiU. When I play on the gamepad on WiiU the frames are a bit more consistent."
13720,"Aye, me 2. But the fact that you can turn the platform upside down and solve it that way is amazingly detailed."
13838,"It's not unfinished at all. I meant not the game's fault because the game plays as intended. The hardware just can't handle it. And that still qualifies as ""no game runs perfectly"". "
14595,I'm not talking about logistics of the gameplay. I am talking about game breaking bugs and major patches needed to make the game functional. 
14778,"While I agree, ""running at"" and ""occasional dips"" are 2 different things. The game would be almost unplayable if it ran at sub 20 fps. And it does run well. I haven't had a single problem. But I am not a frame junkie at all. I notice the frame dips but it's FAR from harmful for me. I am also the type that will play a game on PC a bit higher than my system can handle as long as I get around 30 fps so I'm different."
14858,"Again, like my original post, nothing game breaking. Exploits and game breaking bugs are 2 TOTALLY different things. Name a single game in history that doesn't have exploits. "
26435,"Yea, it's not that bad. Gerudo for me was never constant 20. And while Xenoblade is gorgeous, it didn't have nearly the amount of effects going in at once. It had a beautiful, enormous world that was a feat for the WiiU but Zelda has much more going on in a screen. Grass effect, Link's expressions and maneurisms, subtle audio effects, rain that altered the lighting and so on. Again, Xenoblade was gorgeous but they sacrificed the little details. Zelda went all in on little details and sacrificed frames. I'm good with that."
38777,OK sure. Let's talk shit instead. That's better. Nothing like being overly angry or upset about everything. 
38866,I don't need 6 weeks. I'm enjoying it. More than anything I can remember in a long time. I look forward to playing. I haven't felt like that in a long time. I don't need a month to tell me I like it a lot.
38988,"For you it is. For me, it's not. I can look past it easily since the game is insanely fun. And it seems a lot agree with that. You don't have to. Move on to something else. You don't have to try and convince people their wrong you know. Because I'm not wrong. I love the game. I can't be wrong about what I like."
71391,"&gt; So it was a design choice to have meaningless side quests that have NO story, shit rewards and basically 90% of them are fetch quests?

Lol every single open world game to date. Except Witcher 3."
71459,"Oh no, someone called me a fanboy because I enjoy something. I probably should delete the post. I don't want to rile up the frame whores."
71562,"I wonder how many are under 25? They must be or they have forgotten every single console before these had massive slow down. PS1, SNES, NES, Genesis, PS2. The better the game looked, the worse it ran. BUT (at least in the snes days) we didn't have the internet to rage on."
71713,"I like how you make sure to put PS4 Pro and not ps4. Does the original ps4 get a pass for low frame rates in some games? And let's not compare a $1500 pc to anything on frames. There's no way you are getting 200FPS on highest settings on a $400 system. Well, Minecraft MAYBE."
71859,"I agree with this. The pad functionality was key. It's very unfourtunate they didn't make item management better. It feels VERY Witcher 3. And that was one of the worst parts of that game. ""Oh you need to put oils on your weapon every other fight? Nah, we won't give you a quick way to do that! SCrew you!"""
72050,I haven't been there yet but the story is by far the weakest part for me. I know I'm an apologist here but I kind of expected that. Zelda narratives are always the weakest part of the game. The lore and world are incredible. The humor is great. But the overall story arcs are weak at best. So I went in with low expectations on story. I'm OK with the VA. I'm glad they didn't make it a large part. It wasn't very good so having the entire game acted would have been bad lol.
73351,Fun fact: If you give dogs 3 pieces of fruit or meat it will sometimes lead you to a treasure. Hateno village has one that takes you to a 100 rupee chest.
154877,"Meh, it looks fine for me. The game plays amazingly. I can forgive some resolution any day if that's the case. Sure, other games have technically better graphics but nothing beats how creative this game looks.

Take your own statement. Imagine how amazing a lot of PC/ps4 pro games could be if they took art direction to a better level instead of it just being pretty. A lot of games are just polygon count beautiful but look like every other AAA game. ""Oh look, that npc looks real, I've never seen that before"".

I'm not criticizing though. Every game has its strengths and weaknesses. I'm having more fun in this game than any game in recent history, Witcher 3 included. That makes a couple hundred resolution points forgiveable to me. Especially when it still looks great."
