18514,"As a huge Zelda and Final Fantasy Fan, Breath of the Wild is what I wanted Final Fantasy XV to be. As you mentioned, Breath of the Wild feels complete in terms of content. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Final Fantasy XV. Both being major JRPG of the gaming universe, I can't help but compare the two. Especially when you consider that both games were made with their predecessors in mind, Skyward Sword and Final Fantasy 13, namely both being severely linear. 

Final Fantasy XV intentionally left certain story holes for paid DLC stories while Breath of the Wild's Story DLC only adds to the final product. The sense of exploration is enormous in Breath of the Wild and nowhere is untouchable. Two of FFXV's main cities, Tenebrae and Insomnia are not even explorable. Players of FFXV will also note the dreaded Chapter 13. SE has said that they will update Chapter 13 with more story and make it more enjoyable down the road. This means actually replaying the chapter again once they update it to fully know the story. As of right now, the chapter was clunky and overall not enjoyable.

I know both of these games are completely different franchises and have their differences that make them unique, but Nintendo definitely knows how to make their games feel absolutely complete, and Square Enix could take a few tips from Nintendo."
