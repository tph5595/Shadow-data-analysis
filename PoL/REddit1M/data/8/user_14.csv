10099,"That is definitely not my experience (also on Switch, mostly docked).

There are a few areas which consistently cause framerate problems, notably some of the towns and the Korok forest, and very occasionally I'll get drops when there's a lot of grass on the screen and the camera is low to the ground, but 99.9% of the time it's a solid 30fps."
10437,"Am I the only one who thinks the voice acting is actually pretty decent?

I'm not saying ""OMG best voice acting ever"" or anything, but... I mean, I've heard soooo much worse in other games. I thought it was perfectly fine.

And now I'm having Other M flashbacks... *&lt;shudder&gt;*"
13941,"Eh, people's threshold for ""really bad"" obviously differs. I somehow managed to get through OoT on the N64 while playing at 20fps the whole time, so the occasional drop down to 20 from an otherwise-smooth 30 just isn't that huge of a deal to me.

Yes, the Korok forest had a lot of dips down to 15-20fps for me. I find that elevating the camera a bit tends to fix it when it happens, so... I dunno, I guess I'm just not as picky about framerates as some of these young whippersnappers are."
33144,"I mean, I agree that the voice acting in those games is better. I'm only saying it's ""decent"", not great.

But given Nintendo's general lack of experience with voice acting, and the atrocity that was Other M... I dunno, I was prepared for worse."
