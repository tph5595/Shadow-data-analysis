The complete opposite of FFXV's release.

BotW is definitely the best open world game to be released recently (best in other categories too :P )"
21728,"Pretty sure the shrine trials and the divine beasts combined = more dungeon experience than any other Zelda game. The whole world is one huge dungeon, really.

Definitely would not call them an afterthought or that they cut corners."
21835,"&gt; The only thing I hate is ""A ____ Test of Strength"" shrines.

One of each would've been fine, but after doing what feels like 3+ of each tier, I just want more puzzles."
21871,I liked Urbosa's voice acting personally.
21961,"With the number of different British accents out there, I wouldn't be surprised if they were just British actors.

Side note, American ""Southern"" accents are actually closer to original British accents than modern British accents are. Southern accents are basically slowed down British."
22193,"I'll take Skyward Sword over FFXIII any day.

Still undecided as to which is worse; FFXIII (trilogy) or FFII."
