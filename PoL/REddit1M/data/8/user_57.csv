I just hope that SFZ isn't the end of the franchise since I believe it did very poorly. 

I know Nintendo is known to do bad business decisions that don't make much sense in the long run, hopefully they at least make another ""bad"" decision and make another Star Fox game despite the bad sales of Zero."
