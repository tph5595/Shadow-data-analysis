41637,Oh I'm sorry its 2017 and a brand new console can't run THE ONLY REASON(currently) TO BUY IT.
41806,You're a fanboy though. Nintendo fanboys are the worst for forgiving shit. No one is saying it isn't a great game. But it is pathetic that their brand new console can't maintain 30FPS. What do you expect from this console? If it can't run its first game. On

42126,Are you actually trying to say the story is good in this game? The side quests being dogshit? Couple of voiced lines? Lmao holy shit.
42275,"""Making something too good detracts from other areas"" WTF LOL. Nintendo fans."
42692,"Excuse after excuse. It is brand new hardware. It's 2017. We are in an age of 200FPS on PC and 60FPS on PS4 Pro. 

Zelda is designed to be a system seller and the Switch can't even run it. It's actually hilarious. The amount of FPS drops and texture pop in is insane."

68388,I would honestly be surprised if you aren't very alone right now. Personal pathetic attacks 
68595,"What area of The Witcher did they fear they would make so awesome that it would detract from another area? Your statement makes zero sense. You should be trying to make every part, every system absolutely top notch. 

The only times the Witcher locked you into a story sequence it actually told you - do you want to proceed, you won't be able to return for some time. "
117466,I'm a PC gamer at heart yes. I waited for the PS4 Pro as I didn't feel I needed one before FFXV came out. I don't see how its acceptable in 2017 for a HOME CONSOLE to be spitting out 900p at 20FPS. Not to mention all the other issues. BotW is an amazing game. Imagine how much more amazing on GOOD hardware.
