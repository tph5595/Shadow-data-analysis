They really get some All-Stars from the VA community as well, with Troy Baker in Vesperia, Matt Mercer and Sam Riegal in Xillia, Laura Bailey in Graces, Taliesin Jaffe in Berseria, etc.  Symphonia was probably the weakest, and even it had Scott Menville and Cam Clarke putting out pretty great performances."
