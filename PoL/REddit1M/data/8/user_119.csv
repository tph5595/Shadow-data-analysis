89268,"I'd take what we've gotten over Tales of (or, anyone remember Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure? Or Legend of Dragoon, where even in the rare cases a character enunciated properly, sometimes it sounded like characters were voiced by 2-3 separate people entirely, and one occasionally had a Russian accent?). I think I'm deaf to ""bad"" voice acting after having gone through the days of ""Yeah we just pulled some rando off the street, shoved a script into their hands and locked them in a soundbooth for awhile."""
