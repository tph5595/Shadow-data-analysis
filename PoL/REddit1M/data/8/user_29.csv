15450,"I'd love that, but even the 4 we have are basically just 1. Every divine beast is basically the same dungeon, let's be real :| 

If they could add 5+ in some sort of update, that were unique and interesting, I'd actually buy a DLC pack for once."
15545,"WW had like 7 main dungeons, and a few smaller ones, but at least those main story ones were unique from one another.  

To me, Botw easily has the weakest dungeons of the franchise, for the console systems (ignoring the NES :P) "

Final Fantasy 15, MGS V, Botw. 

The dungeons were an afterthought in this game, and it's sad because they've been a STAPLE in Zelda for decades."
