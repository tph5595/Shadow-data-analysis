70467,"None of the ""new"" consoles last gem could manage 30fps for their launch titles and on beefier hardware at that. The frame drops aren't a good thing, but the game makes up for it with everything else. Most games that come out now don't even have their full content, and need constant patches to fix issues. 

No one is defending the frame drops. They are saying that despite that, the game is good enough that it doesn't matter, and I do think you are exaggerating because I haven't had many frame drops in general, particularly in the dungeon. Are you playing the switch version or Wii u version?"
