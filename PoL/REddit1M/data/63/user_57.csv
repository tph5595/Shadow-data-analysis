25031,I enjoyed it... Just it was wayyy too easy. Rather play windwaker again.
37434,"not as easy as TP. In the entire game I felt challenged by the puzzles maybe 2 or 3 times. On my last playthrough of TP I had a fairy in a bottle I caught in the first dungeon and I didn't end having to use it until the 2nd to last boss.

I die every so often in windwaker and the aesthetic and bosses are more fun in my mind.  I just found it a bit boring. The story was good but just so much running around.

I'd rather chill in my boat and visit the bird people or find a random island with a treasure to get or finding a treasure map and hunting under the ocean to dredge it up. 

There was so much joy in the exploration in windwaker I just never felt in TP. That combined with the lack of challenge. Just makes it a more dull game to me."
