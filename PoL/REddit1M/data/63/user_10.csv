6130,"This is the one console Zelda game I hadn't played, but like you finally got around to this year.  It's my favorite Zelda, and one of my favorite games ever.  The atmosphere, story, world, and music just all clicked really well for me.  

Not to ruffle any feathers, but I actually have a hard time playing through OOT sometimes now, because to me it feels like TP is a bigger better version of OOT (with a different story of course)."
13094,"Yup, and I don't mind it, all three of those games are fantastic.  For years they've been talking about ""changing up Zelda"" and that's basically what they mean, just breaking out of that predictable formula in terms of progression.

Skyward Sword did that in some ways, but but the fanbase can be pretty divisive on that, which is fine.  This is why I'm so excited for BOTW, it seems like it might have the right amount of freshness in progression, but also be familiar.  Also no mandatory motion controls (I'm one of those guys haha).
