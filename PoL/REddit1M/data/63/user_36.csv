Also since they are all packed at the start of the game I could see how somebody might quit the game before getting to the really good parts. I just hated how all the Wolf combat was just mashing or holding B depending on the enemy.

Luckily the art style of the game is really fantastic and beautiful despite it being 10 years old."
