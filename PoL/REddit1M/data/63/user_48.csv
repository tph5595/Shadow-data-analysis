23167,My first Zelda game and my favorite. The characters in this game made it way better! And I TOTALLY get what you were saying about the end credits. I've played the game twice and the end credits was equally as powerful both times! Got me right in the feels *sniff* *sniff*
23190,YAAAAAAAAAYEEEEEEEEYAYAYEYEYASSSSS!
23276,she actually gets a lot of credit believe it or not. The only reason it seems like she doesn't is because of Navi overshadowing her.

38205,"Lol could tell by the name, just beat the game in about a week this past week. Loved it and think its super underrated."
72552,I thought she was the Master Sword the entire time while playing the game but she wasn't. She just dwells within it which is so weird and ew.
