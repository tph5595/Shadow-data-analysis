31703,windwaker is really easy too. 
38119,"man it's been the opposite for me. i like both games, i think they're both pretty equal in difficulty. i'm playing windwaker right now and i don't think i've even used my shield once other than for reflecting light. i don't think i've died either. 


the bosses are incredibly easy in both games. but i think TP's bosses were way more interesting, especially since they all have at least two phases to them. and that dragon boss was such a cool battle!


the exploring in wind waker isn't that exciting for me. it's basically just a flat plane with different plots on a grid for you to visit. i preferred having a world design more similar to TP. idk, wind waker gets very ""look at treasure chart, find the island, warp as close as possible, sail to the spot and pick up the treasure. repeat.""  even when i play the game so that i get a good spread out mix of treasure hunting and story progression, it just doesn't do it for me.


i can't really use lack of challenge against one game or the other. they were both incredibly easy to me. 



definitely like both of the games though, it's just interesting to see how we can hold essentially the same exact opinions but with the games swapped lol."
