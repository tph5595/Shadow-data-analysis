42415,"WW is largely the same as well, I'd argue more similar to OoT/ALTTP than TP was;

step 1 - collect three macguffins 

step 2 - get master sword

step 3 - collect 7/8 *different* macguffins

step 4 - finish final dungeon(s) and beat final boss

1. the pearls in WW  serve the exact same purpose as the macguffins in alttp/OoT (gaining access to the master sword and the temple of time in the case of OoT/WW). TPs three starting macguffins have an entirely different use (repairing the twilit mask).

2. Alttp/OoT/WW all acquire the master sword as a direct result for collecting the three macguffins. TP has no connection between the twilit mask and getting the Master Sword.

3. this is the same between alttp/OoT/WW, as they need the macguffins to beat the final boss, while TP simply requires them to access the second last dungeon (twilight realm).

4. alttp/oot/ww all simply end with a final dungeon and boss at this point, while TP has to go through the Twilight realm and beat Zant *then* raid Hyrule castle and beat Ganondorf.

TP, despite trying it's goddamn hardest to be OoT 2.0, is arguably the most unique of the four, with the only unique feature WW having is the artstyle, and the monotonous boat instead of the monotonous horse."

and don't go there wearing the zora armour... that one took me awhile to figure out."

Either way though, it's still not as a result of the mask, that was Zants scheming right?"
