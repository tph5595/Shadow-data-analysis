86424,"Depending on how you see it, it does give you this sort of ""I took you for granted"" moment, though."
86536,I don't think any of the 2d Zeldas have characters that are as alive as those in the 3d games.  Maybe it's that you can actually see their facial expressions/body language in the cutscenes.  But the dialogue is also lengthier in those I think
86791,"The wii u is pretty nice.  I'm sorry if this is still out of your price range, but I picked mine up used off ebay for $160, with mario kart 8 already installed.  It works fine.  The price on them is bound to continue dropping, and they can play netflix/hulu/youtube/use web browsers.  You can even play on the gamepad screen while someone else uses the tv screen.  The only thing it doesn't do is play dvds.  If that's too expensive, then used Wiis are dirt cheap.  And you can play all the 3d Zeldas on these."
87420,"I don't think you can call it overlooked.  Pretty much any ""top dungeon"" video or thread will have multiple mentions of Snowpeak in it."
87632,"I like the side characters too.  But it seems to set them up in the first part of the game with multiple interactions.  And then it completely forgets about them for most of the rest of the game.  I wish they had fleshed out the kids and the Adults with more cutscenes and dialogue, and the resistance would have been much better if they fought alongside you in more battles."
87661,it still interupts lol.  One of the things people criticize about that moment
88034,"I thought the cutscenes/story were great.  Maybe the side characters could have been given additional development rather than forgetting about them after the first part of the game.  The dungeons were awesome, no complaint there.  The bosses were cool concepts, but could have been given more intelligence so they weren't so damn easy.  The sword skills were awesome, and it would have been good to see them actually incorporated in the design of the enemies to make the fights more dynamic.  This Ganon is my favorite in terms of fights, though I wish the final stage gave Ganon better swordfighting abilites, with AI similar to dark link, and Ganon having a set of sword skills similar to the ones Link learns.  Finally, I loved how massive the overworld felt and how cool it looked, but it was empty and didn't reward any exploration."

123626,haha well there you go.  Wish mine had one of those.  Do you have to pay for the material it uses or is it all free?
