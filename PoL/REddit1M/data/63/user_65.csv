31758,"Twilight Princess has some of the best dungeons in the series. While it never quite reaches the greatness of the forest temple from OOT, the Arbiter Grounds, Snowpeak Ruins, Palace of Twilight, and city of the sky are some of the best dungeons in the series. They're inventive, well set and lots of fun.

I also think that the Forest Temple in Twilight Princess is one of the best intro dungeons I've ever played. The monkeys are fun, help you feel like you are making progress, and help guide new players without really slowing down experienced ones.

However its hard to get over the feeling that Twilight Princess doesn't have a soul. It's trying really hard to be OOT 2.0 and its not shy about it. Not only that but it takes *forever* to get going and that really bogs down the game for me. I like the game, but it falls short. "
