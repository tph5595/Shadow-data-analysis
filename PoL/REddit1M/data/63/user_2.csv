2812,My favorite Zelda. Glad to hear you enjoyed it.

24718,I love the lore that Zant attacked a few days before her coronation. Zelda is only a Princess on a technicality.
170828,"""Everything"" seems a bit all encompassing. And wrong. Graphics? Swordplay? Malo-based sidequests? "
171792,"The ""Zelda Cycle"" is just an observation of general trends within the fandom, which absolutely does change it's opinion as time goes on. TP is also nowhere near the worst Zelda, even ignoring obvious shit like the CDi games. 

* Depth is a nebulous as hell complaint, but TP already has a deeper combat system than most 3D Zeldas and deeper lore than a lot of the 2D games. 

* Awkwardly paced is patently wrong, since it's the same goddamn plot structure as OoT, and SS is objectively worse in terms of pacing, having you revisit areas three times, often with little to no changes.

* Again, SS is more linear. And guess what? Linearity being a con is purely subjective!

You're free to dislike TP, but try to dislike it for actual reasons instead of stupid buzzwords that don't mean anything."
