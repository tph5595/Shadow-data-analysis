24157,"Twilight Princess is one of those games where I feel like I would enjoy playing it more now than I did then. It just couldn't possibly have lived up to the hype of being a ""Next Gen Zelda."" 

I got a Wii on launch day - after years of waiting for a new Zelda - and ultimately felt like it fell short to every other 3D Zelda at that point. Sure, the world was big... but it felt empty. With OOT, MM, and WW, it felt like there were secrets and new things around every corner. With TP, I didn't feel any of that: I completed the game, got all the collectables, and went ""that's it?"" 

It left such a bad taste in my mouth that I never actually went back to replay it... but every now and then, I see art or characters or music from TP and remember how gorgeous a lot of it was. Maybe one day (like when the NX is out) I'll give it another try and just enjoy it without all the hype attached. "
