The big thing is the duality in Twilight Princess is totally temporary. There's the Twilight world, but you restore it to normal and never return. Oot and at alttp both deal with lots of switching back and forth between their worlds. 

The master sword bit in tp isn't a shifting of gameplay gears like the first two, it's simply a thematic one. That's been a thing in every Zelda game period. Wind Waker and Skyward Sword did it too. 

Zelda is pretty formulaic as a whole. It's not a huge issue, but after twenty years, changing it up with some new improvements and adding in elements from other genres is in order. Especially since, while there are open world rpg adventure games, none are anything remotely like Zelda."

But besides that, you're pretty much spot on. It's not hard because the game gives you health. In. Every. Boss. Battle. The enemies aren't dumb, but they're clearly designed around the basic combat, not the crazy moves that you learn. And they're easy as a result. I

The plot has great side characters, but but Zelda and Ganondorf play too big of a role for their screen time. Why do I care Zelda died? I met her once! And Zant was wasted..   


Still my favorite post ocarina Zelda game. Majora's Mask is great, but has too much mandatory back tracking for no reason. And wind Waker gas sailing and mandatory fetch quests to cover it's huge lack of dungeons (there are 6. Tp has 9 plus optional stuff. Ocarina has 11 if you count the gerudo training ground. Yeah.)
