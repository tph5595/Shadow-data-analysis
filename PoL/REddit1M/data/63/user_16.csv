7803,"How did you feel about the second half of the game? I remember feeling that after the Arbiter's Grounds, the story and pacing took a nosedive that the game never recovered from. The dungeons themselves were excellent, albeit painfully easy. But there had been so much great world building in the first half that it was a bit jarring for me when it suddenly stopped.

Did you feel that, or did you enjoy the second half just as much?"
