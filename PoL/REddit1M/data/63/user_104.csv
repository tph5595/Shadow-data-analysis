51295,"Unfortunately for me it's the opposite. I first played it when it came out on the Wii and loved it back then.

But recently with the HD remake I decided to play again after all this time and I didn't enjoy as much as other Zeldas. The theme and art style is great but the way the game is structured made me dislike it.

The way how Hyrule Field just feels like a bunch of hallways and how Zelda hardly had any role in the game except at the end as a damsel in distress. Also the twilight bug hunting parts where extremely annoying.

It did have my two favorite dungeons of the saga though ( Snow peak and the Desert Temple) ."
