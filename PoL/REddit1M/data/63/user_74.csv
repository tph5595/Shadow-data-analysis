The whole idea of the game is that you are a boy from a small village, nothing special on the surface and you're thrust into this epic adventure to save Hyrule. The huge empty world helps to build that sense of being small and insignificant compared to the world and events around you. It makes you almost uncomfortable, but that's the point. It's very similar to Shadow of the Collosus in that regard. At least that's what I got from it."
