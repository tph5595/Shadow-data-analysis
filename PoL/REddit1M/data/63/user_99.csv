[Hidden Village - The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Music Extended](https://youtube.com/watch?v=W5vWiXcJrDE)|[121](https://reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/56ht2c/_/d8jimzf?context=10#d8jimzf) - That segment is so damn fun and the music is great too. Then afterwards you get to talk to a bunch of cats.  I always keep a save file for that segment and the Stallord fight. 
[Legend of Zelda: Twilight Ganondorf Fishing Rod](https://youtube.com/watch?v=hsR-dIXl1cQ)|[7](https://reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/56ht2c/_/d8jvvdk?context=10#d8jvvdk) -

Dear god, the guys behind that are fucking geniuses. The Twilight Symphony might just be one of my favorite musical pieces of all time. A shame the ZREO team disbanded after - it was their last piece of work....

Whether you like their dungeon mechanics or not, you have to admit they're good characters. Laruto and Fado along with them. Their musical segments are some of my favorite songs in the series.

Listen to all of them, they kick ass.   Hidden Village, Hyrule Field, Gerudo Desert, Midna's Lament, Princess Zelda, A Door to the Past (that might be the best version of The Song of Time I've ever heard), Blizzeta of course, and Blood, S...
