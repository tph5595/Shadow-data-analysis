You do three dungeons and get the Master Sword, then do a bunch more dungeons, then fight Ganon/Ganondorf. Then there's the whole world duality aspect; light world and dark world, present and future, light realm and twilight realm. For me, it kind of takes away from my enjoyment of those games. "

There are a lot of great aspects to the game that do detract from the formula, but the controls and the linearity are what kill it for a lot. Hopefully, BotW will live up to the hype."
