11362,"*Twilight Princess* is one of the most conflicting Zelda games for me.

On the one hand, the art style is gorgeous. I love the character designs, how the colorful, bright, and rounded Hylia contrasts with the harsh, contrasting, square Twilight Realm.            
I love the new combat moves and how they add on to *Wind Waker's* additions.           
I love the side characters -- our little band of pub-based heroes, the girls in town (color-coded to the goddesses) that fawn over you, Malo (just in general), the Yeti couple, and so many more.               
Speaking of which, the Yeti Mansion was a great level, subverting the usual temple layout of being some sacred place perverted by evil (shout out to the Goron Mines for the same reason).              
Also, Zant was an interesting villain for the majority of the game whose twist I think could have been set up better -- though I still appreciate subverting expectations.

But... Jesus Christ there's a lot of problems with it.

Going through new areas as Wolf Link to unlock them is dull. Wolf Link, in general, is just dull because he has so few options in combat and most enemy encounters with him rely on using B to kill everyone at once... Which is not fun.            
Similarly, jousting was cool in theory and even looked great, but the controls for horseback combat (especially in the HD version) were horrid.              
The overworld of Hyrule Field is sizable, but empty. It doesn't have nearly enough secrets or events or even enemies to keep you interested as you plow through it.          
And it's just... So... EASY. Even on Hero Mode in the HD version it was a breeze. Enemies aren't smart or aggressive enough to make you really use those new techniques (outside of the few Darknuts) and the bosses are just rinse and repeat, for the most part, even if they look cool at first blush.

There's just no sense of real threat. Enemies are too easy and the Twilight Realm taking over doesn't have much lasting impact or consequence. The best moment, storywise, is when Zant ambushes you and offhandedly curses you, banishes the light spirit, and nearly kills Midna. (Zelda sacrificing herself to save Midna was great, too, but we don't get enough time with Zelda in this game for that to carry much weight)                
But after that, Zant just kind of sits around and waits for you to get to him, and then goes crazy to be replaced by Ganondorf, who doesn't have anywhere near the pathos or intrigue he did in *Wind Waker*.

It just ends up feeling like a wasted opportunity. Like *Skyward Sword*, only less repetitive and with a worse ending. I appreciate it's intent and a lot of it was done well, but I can't help but compare it to the game it could have been."

In *Shadow of the Colossus*, the game is pretty much all getting to bosses, then fighting bosses (and maybe shooting a few lizards). The world is empty and exploration through it is generally light to let you absorb the details of that desolate land and reflect on your struggle. It's tightly focused, with each halves' opposing values reinforcing the other.

In *Twilight Princess*, exploration through the overworld is sprinkled with a few short, unengaging things to do, like chop grass for rupies, find bugs, and fight a few enemies. None of it is really important, though, since the first two tie into the game's meager selection of stuff you can buy and the last only involves a small selection of evemy types and situations that just seem hobbled together. None of them are really engaging and the world they take place in doesn't really have much going on outside of those few small towns. It lacks the focus, tone, and polish of *Colossus's* world and doesn't even have it's truly open-world nature, since it's broken up into segments.

Obviously I'm not saying your experience with the game is invalid. I'm just saying that while they both have lightly-packed overworlds, they have completely different purposes and executions that make it an uncompelling comparison."
