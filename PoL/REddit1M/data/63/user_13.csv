6521,"this is honestly my favorite zelda game. for a while people didnt seem to like it, but the story, temples, and the setting is amazing. i remember when it first came out, playing it and thinking this is a spiritual successor to ocarina of time. the return to hyrule, riding epona through the fields, all the temples, to me it just felt like nintendo was trying to outdo themselves. and they did. ocarina of time was my favorite but once i got my hands on this game, it blew my mind. 

skyward sword was good too, just a bit too linear for my taste. looking forward to breath of the wild though..im sure nintendo will outdo themselves once again."
