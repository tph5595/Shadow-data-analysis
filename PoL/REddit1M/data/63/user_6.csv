5666,"The side characters made the game for me. Wind Waker is my favorite Zelda, but it lacks side characters that you care and feel for. 

I played it when it first came to the Wii, but got stuck on the desert dungeon boss (big ol' skelly dude) and eventually gave up. I picked it up for the Wii U when it came out and I was really blown away. Never in a Zelda game (or most games) had I felt for the side characters like I did in this game. When the kids went missing and I found the scent, it was just a mad dash to find them. Then when Midna got hurt and you had to run to find Zelda, there were no distractions. Most games don't give me a sense of urgency like that (except for when they have a time limit). 

It's easily my second favorite Zelda game. I prefer Wind Waker because it's just a bright and warm game. But Twilight Princess is an excellent game. Definitely doesn't get the attention that it deserves"
