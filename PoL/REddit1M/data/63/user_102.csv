50060,"I really loved the more detailed and more adult fantasy-like designs (like Frank Frazetta) compared to the more caricaturized OoT and Majora, and the more cartoony and cel-shaded Wind Waker.

I really really wanted an artbook of Twilight Princess by itself just to see all the concept art. By far my most favorite Zelda art style of all time.

It's a shame they went with a different art style for the later games. It's still really good, but Twilight Princess design has a special place in my heart."
