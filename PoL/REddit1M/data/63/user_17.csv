13296,"Very well stated. I have many of the same problems with it. The game is beautiful to look at, and there are some truly fun moments in it that are worth all of the boring as hell catch-the-bugs-awkwardly sections. But something about it just screams incomplete to me. Not like it wasn't finished--more like, there was something there, and it just didnt make the final cut. 

I guess to me, TP feels like the theatrical version of a game that really needed a directors cut to get across everything it sort of tried to make me feel. "
22183,Totally. I want to play it again now just to look at it lol. It holds up quite well on that level.
