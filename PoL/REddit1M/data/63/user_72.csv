35558,"I was confused for a moment. I haven't played the game this character is in and misread your comment as Ezio and though ""Huh? That's a different game and he's the main character not partner"" Took me about 5 time rereading your comment to catch on that that is an L not an I."
35688,"It's not only my favorite zelda but my favorite game of all time!!! It is the only game I have beat many times (I don't know how many) Most games I beat just once, maybe twice then keep them for replay value in case I ever want to play them again. Twilight Princess is the only one I can play over and over and never get bored of it!!!"
