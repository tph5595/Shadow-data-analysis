Shooting the cannon was awesome, and the ball and chain is super fun (albeit slow).

And in the boss battle, his wife is legitimately creepy. Probably also in my top favorite dungeons in all games. Like you said, it broke the formula."

Little things I like to mention though, I really liked how you could run and pull your sword out with no interruption in the running. Like, in OOT, MM, and WW, Link would stop moving when you swung your sword. Same with how you could swing your sword/do a spin attack while you were riding Epona. I would always be running around swinging my sword for no reason, you could jog past an enemy and give him damage.

Also, when you cut down a wooden sign and the pieces fall on the ground, you could pick up the pieces and chuck them around.

And when enemies missed you when they shot arrows at you, you could run over to where the arrow was on the ground and collect it. I did this around the Hidden Village when I was low on arrows and didn't want to go search for/but arrows.

Some of these are probably superficial details that no one really cares about, but they made the game just that much better.
