It was a big deal to a lot of people to finally get back to a visual style closer to OOT, and that bred a lot of expectations of another OOT. So when it turned out to be its own thing, it made my 20 self feel a little disappointed that I didn't get the same feelings that I did with my 13 year old OOT fan self. I wasn't fair to it, because nothing could bring me back to the wonder of childhood gaming. Looking back, I remember how visually interesting it was, and how it contained a lot of amazing world building that is usually my favorite kind of thing from the Zelda franchise. Anyway, thanks for making me realize I need to play it again."
