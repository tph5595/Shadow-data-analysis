5676,Midna best partner. Hands down. She got way too little appreciation. 
10027,That's a low blow dude. My feels. TnT
13548,Ezlo is a great guy but he didn't have the same impact on me.
38428,Majestic ain't it? 
38484,I didn't get to play after the Gamecube era so I don't count for that. Consoles are too expensive for me and lack enough return to the investment. I'm too picky about what I play to warrant such a large investment.

Even if I did have the money there's still not many games I'd actually enjoy playing. I'd be playing things for no reason than to make it a worthwhile purchase, not because I enjoy playing video games.

I haven't played videogames in more than a decade, I just watch people play a few games and get some satisfaction from that."
78951,It's a very pleasant game. Really enjoyable. But not a huge draw beyond the art and cuteness for me. It's the best from the GBA era of Zelda. 
79624,"The King was a really pleasant dude in pretty much my favourite Zelda game ever. I really enjoyed him as a kid. I may like Midna more than him, but I like WW more than TP.

Edit: I thought you said you liked Midna's ass the first time I read this. "

103588,My library has a 3d printer. If they don't also have Zelda there is something wrong with this reality.
