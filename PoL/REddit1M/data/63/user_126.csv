78779,"[Check out the Twilight Symphony version.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8SRHURU1HA)

Dear god, the guys behind that are fucking geniuses. The Twilight Symphony might just be one of my favorite musical pieces of all time. A shame the ZREO team disbanded after - it was their last piece of work. Hell of a way to go out though."
79043,"I feel like Makar and Medli count too. Whether you like their dungeon mechanics or not, you have to admit they're good characters. Laruto and Fado along with them. [Their](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_Obyzzl87c) [musical segments](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjGyZDV5GtM) [are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RwVI-MKbgnI) [some](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VSbnCpqEEvA) of my favorite songs in the series."
79374,"It is kind of a shame they made her a hand-holding mechanic, because I *love* Fi's concept and character design. [Z-Raid's comics](http://scribbly-z-raid.tumblr.com/post/122108196479/dance-of-blades) and other misc. Fi/Zelda art basically gave her a real personality and story, which I really appreciated."
79923,Blizzeta's theme is easily one of my favorite boss themes. Check out the [Twilight Symphony](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G0QV1pi88ug&amp;list=RDD1fUcI0l6sU&amp;index=18) version.

[Hidden Village](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8SRHURU1HA&amp;list=RDD1fUcI0l6sU&amp;index=5), [Hyrule Field](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uzS5lq2Dp8o&amp;index=2&amp;list=RDD1fUcI0l6sU), [Gerudo Desert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DqbKqe1aaco&amp;list=RDD1fUcI0l6sU&amp;index=3), [Midna's Lament](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4F7Sk83kDI&amp;list=RDD1fUcI0l6sU&amp;index=8), [Princess Zelda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oKeOPVP_2xU&amp;list=RDD1fUcI0l6sU&amp;index=10), [A Door to the Past](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVyuxSmdlX0&amp;index=11&amp;list=RDD1fUcI0l6sU) (that might be the best version of The Song of Time I've ever heard), Blizzeta of course, and [Blood, Spirit, and Hatred](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUJdvBcRFow&amp;index=27&amp;list=RDD1fUcI0l6sU) are probably my favorites, but the entire thing is great. That last one is an amalgamation of every piece of music that plays in the Hyrule Castle throne room at the end of the game. ""Ganon's Puppet, Zelda"" has one of my favorite boss themes, [and they did a great job with it.](https://youtu.be/dUJdvBcRFow?list=RDD1fUcI0l6sU&amp;t=161)

Edit: Oops, shit, my bad. [Throne of the Demon Thief](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLiVWrUN8mQ) is the one in the throne room, obviously. And Puppet Zelda is [here](https://youtu.be/FLiVWrUN8mQ?t=110). Blood, Spirit, and Hatred plays during the horse chase, I think."
