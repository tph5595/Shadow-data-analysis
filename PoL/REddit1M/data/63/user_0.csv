0,"I'm just blown away by how good this game was. I pretty much forgot the way the game played out and it took me a month and a half to complete the campaign. 50 hours on a campaign from a 10 year old game...there's so much content in this game it's ridiculous. 

The Zant bossfight was dope going back to the previous bossfight settings. The characters were lively and you felt for them. The Zora race was beautifully designed. The Goron sumo match was really fun, it's a shame you couldn't play it again (or could you?). The [music from the Snowpeaks boss](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXcPpnyy42E) sent shivers, my god. The duality of the light and twilight realms reminded me of Metroid Prime 2, another epic game. Midna was rich and dynamic; for a good bit I was like 'stop using me and GTFO' but by the end of the game when she shattered the Mirror I was like 'NOOO WTF'. Seriously, wtf ;_;? And then the ending credits...[Right in the feels](http://i.imgur.com/Nnlbfbe.png)

This game was fucking beast and it's a shame it took me 10 years to play it again. It is well on my list of games to play every 3-4 years now. If you haven't played this game in that long, you gotta play it again.

7567,"Snowpeak was the hardest dungeon for me when I played this 10 years ago. My kid brain took ages to figure those icy box puzzles to the point it got super frustrating. And those spinning ice monsters wrecked me too hard so I'd run out of hearts a lot. When I played it this time around, I had a prior mental image of it being a 'bad' dungeon. 

It turned out to be an awesome dungeon. From the snowboarding part to get to it, to the homey soup element, to the creepy twitchy cutscene when you finally fight Yeta. Amazing dungeon. "

And then when I had to find the kitties I spent a lot of time and effort in wolf form trying to reach the other roof, eventually realizing I can claw shot my way over in human form because of the vines.  "
25517,Magic armor was seriously a huge letdown. Looked badass but I never used it. Obvious goldsink.
25786,"On my first playthrough, I must have put over 40 hours just getting to the desert region. At which point I was like 'okay I got the master sword, let's kill Zant' and when I was told I had to find the shards I was like '...oh fuck'.

This time around, I was just glad there is more Zelda left to play. Story wise, the strand that connected the second half would have to be retrieving Ilias memory back. "
