Now I have to go dust off my wii, plug it in, figure out why it isn't working on my TV, spend 20m on that, spend an hour finding TP disc, and then the next month or two playing it.

Thanks OP. I didn't like it much in middle school when it came out.. god damnit I'm so old.... I will probably appreciate it more this time."
