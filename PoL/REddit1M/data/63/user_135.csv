The world, items, dungeons, pacing, rewards/secrets are all leagues above TP"

TP's world isn't empty in a derelict fashion, it is simply devoid of things worth discovering.

It does not reward you for exploration, which is a key part of the Zelda experience. Your items have so little use outside of the dungeons, and the world is filled with static objects you cannot interact with, it makes the game feel half finished."

153152,Everything about OoT is better than TP
171289,"Visually I like OoT's colors. TP is beautiful but very drab.

OoT's combat felt faster and ""looser"" the entire targeting and combat system was created here. TP is a very stiff feeling game overall in comparison.

No Malo, but OoT gives you rewards for completing side quests that are actually worthwhile, unlike Magic Armor and Fairie's Tears"
171771,"What it seems like to me, is TP just hits the right mood with its artistic style and world that some people just love. I agree it's very very good, but less for ""Zelda"" type reasons if that makes sense"
