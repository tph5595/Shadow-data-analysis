14569,"It's one of my favorites.  For a long time I was disappointed in how much hate it got from fans, that it was so bad that it would end the Zelda series, how big of a let down it was, and so on.  But I've come to realize that every game post ocarina of time was destroying the series.  I remember being there when Majora's Mask was a rehash full of re-used assets, and when Windwaker was a bad cartoon that spent 90 percent of its time staring at an empty sea.

A few years later, they're universally beloved classics, and a lot of newer fans (or older fans who didn't spend much time in internet games discussion when the games were new) wouldn't even believe the negativity that really happened.

It is about t he time in lifespan of a Zelda game in which Twilight Princess stops being the modern game that doesn't match up to the nostalgia people have for Ocarina of Time, and starts being judged on its own merits.  

Consider, though, how nice it is that the games in the Zelda series have such long lifespans that these kinds of dynamics can be seen."
