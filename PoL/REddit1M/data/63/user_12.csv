6472,"Snow peak mansion is a beautifully designed dungeon that is often overlooked. From the layout, to the yetis guidance and cooking, and even the small details and paintings it's easily one of the best in the game. Not to mention some really great puzzles. All in all it broke the formula. But as for people you care about, these two are introduced as monsters but couldn't be further from that. They truly show how deeply couples care for one another when they literally produce a heart container for you!"

Seems right. Haven't tested with all 20 yet).  Granted fairies would help, but nevertheless that was a fun discovery.  Just imagine if you could just carry that firepower around with you. "
