21882,"Spoilers for the first memory, I guess? But does anyone have references/concept art/screencaps of Zelda's outfit when she's ""knighting"" Link in an early memory? It looks way more regal and traditional than her standard outfit, and I was interested in making it for a con! I've tried googling/searching around and haven't found any clear shots!"
