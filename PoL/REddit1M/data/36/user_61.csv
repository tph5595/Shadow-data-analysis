If you try to adventure to other areas, you may find lots of enemies that will OHK you. That's called a soft lock. Also, even if you are caught off guard and die for no reason, it's no big deal, as this game basically don't punish deaths, unlike Dark Souls."

The whole point of the game is that you can do whatever you want, including rushing to the boss underprepared, but the one thing the game tells you is ""train yourself up then go destroy ganon"". This seems like a clear case of git gud."
