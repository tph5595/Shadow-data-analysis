18919,Did you try looking at night? They light up and are easier to see. 
52165,"Every town and stable has one. For stables it's always outside the stable and off to the side. In towns it varies. In Hateno, it's right next to the house you can buy. 

There are some in monster camps like someone else said. I know there's one in a monster camp right before the cold area on the great plateau. Also one by the old mans cabin. 

Don't know if there's a map available, but they're pretty much everywhere. "
54943,You can start mapping some yourself by putting stamps on your map. I try to mark them when I see them because I'm not fast traveling and it helps to know if there's one nearby
