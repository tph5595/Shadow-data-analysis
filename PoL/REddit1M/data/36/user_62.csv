34845,"What are you favorite places to farm things for upgrading stuff? 

Best places for me for example:

Heart bass - The small pond 5' o clock from the P in Firly Plateau (South east of Hateno tower)

Might Bass and other fish - 10' o clock from Kam Urog Shrine, north of Fort Hateno up the waterfall. 

The Hot-footed frog - 2-3' o clock from Ne'ez Yohma Shrine, At Lulu Lake. 

What are your favorites or best spots? really looking for some good ones"
