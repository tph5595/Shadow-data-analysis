4509,You can purchase pictures from the lab if you've missed some or find it hard to find those subjects. Makes it a bit easier.
5032,If you got the money for it.

Stalizalfos and Stalmoblins are common enough that you can sell your stock of Moblin and Lizalfos parts and still have them replenished.

There are few things rare enough to need holding onto. Beetles maybe. Perhaps certain fish. But ores and most parts can be tossed into the money machine."

You'll know for sure when there's a glowing spot on the ground. You won't be able to see it from far away, but it'll be there when you find the right place."
40393,"And those ore will be easy to come by. I'd hold onto diamonds for a while, but rubies, sapphires and below are safe. Chests are scattered everywhere, and ores are tucked almost behind every rock, so these ore are fairly easy to replenish.


Absolute worst case scenario: a piece of armour you weren't planning on using goes unupgraded for a while."

55999,"""Go to Akkala,"" they said. ""South of skull lake, a ton of beetles,"" they said.

I heard a voice cry out, like a thousand beeping radars cried out and were instantly silenced when an octorok shot too close or a stalmoblin decided to spawn right next to one."
