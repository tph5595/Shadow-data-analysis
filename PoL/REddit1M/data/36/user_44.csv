20552,There's a certain number of photos that cannot be purchased
42695,Doesn't give one weapon and a few bosses
55864,"Yes, it doesn't give [The Master Sword](/spoiler), [Silver Enemies](/spoiler), or [the last two bosses (I haven't finished the game so I don't know what they are)](/spoiler)

There might be more but by the time I started buying photos I already had a lot taken myself.

[I've read that once you finish the game a new category opens up where the photos are 500 rupees a piece and you can buy them that way, but I can't confirm that.](/spoiler)

I've since read that's exactly why. Did some of the photos cost 500 rupees?"
95137,"Yup, otherwise I guess it'd spoil a wee bit of content"
