16643,Can I get help with two shrines? I'm not sure which stars you need to look at for the shrine in the korok forest. And the five flames trial is tricky. 
16750,"Do you have all your powers? Being able to use bombs, stasis, and magnesis at the right times can really get you out of a pinch when facing enemies. Like early on see if there are metal boxes you can drop of them. Also being sneaky pays off. "
16865,"Do you have stasis+? I just did 3 of the major tests of strength using mostly stasis to lock them in place, then a moblin club charged to send them flying and repeat. Eating an Attack up buff meal will help as well. If you can trick it to paralyze itself by spinning into a column that'll do you well. "
16956,"I think i'm very close to it, but I can't seem to find it. :("
18590,Hmm I want to say I was right there...I'll check agian. 
18632,"Okay fire arrows, got it. Or i can start a fire in the trial, can't i? hmm.  
  "
18723,"No, that sounds tricky too. This one is you have one block suspended with unlit torches. You hit switches to spin the block, but one of the sides of the block spits water thereby putting out the flames. 

And thank you for the help on the star one!"
29097,yep or I've got some red chu jelly. 
50725,"Yeah, i bought it and talked to the one builder that heads over that way. Do I need to do anything else or does him leaving start it enough?"
