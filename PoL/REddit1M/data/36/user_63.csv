34333,I've done the Spring of Wisdom quest - with the dragon Naydra. Does she spawn and fly around again after you do this quest? I haven't seen her since. Might just be because I haven't been looking too hard though.

46001,"Ohh, okay. That might be why I never saw her, I kept going right to the mountain and waiting. This is helpful, thank you!! I wanted to get some dragon parts from her :)"
