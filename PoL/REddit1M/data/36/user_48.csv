23261,I don't found anyone selling fairies. Furthermore I think they won't show up again on great fairy fountains or those heart/broken heart pond as long you have still some fairies in your inventory. I never had more than 6. But I'm not sure about how this works.

If you meant the shrines itself, they are basically puzzles, riddles and such you need to solve or fights."

The fastest way I've found is to beat lots of (dangerous) enemies, such as Stone Talus, Hinox and Lynels...maybe lots of regular enemies is also enough. When I've beaten many of them, the blood moon came almost every time when just a regular full moon was about to rise.

Hope this helps."

34575,"Yes, Naydra spawns again after that. If you wish I can tell you where to stand at which time to make her spawn. "
35070,"Ok. Naydra spawns at 9 pm and at midnight over Mount Lanayru, but she doesn't spawn when you are near.
A good spot to see her coming and get parts from her is near the purifier lake west from the mountain. There's a peak close northwest of it. Climb there atop, make a fire and wait till night. She spawns shortly after 9 pm over Mount Lanayru and flies near your position. ðŸ˜‰"
36293,You make things fly with them by dropping them upon. I.e. a raft or a barrel.
36843,There's a way to revive your horse.
37283,In every area you travel you will meet a painting guy in villages or stables. You can show him the 12 photos in different areas and he will tell you where you may find the next nearby. You meet him first in Kakariko in front of Impas House.
