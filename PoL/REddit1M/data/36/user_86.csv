62802,"I'm really stuck on the Eventide Island trial. I've activated two of the three pedestals, but now I HAVE to get the sphere from the Hinox up onto the pedestal on top of the mountain, and I have no idea how. I am in this predicament because:

* I accidentally exploded the mountaintop sphere off the mountain
* I then used the mountaintop sphere to activate one of the lower pedestals, meaning that it would no longer respawn at its original location on top of the mountain
* I have given up on the trial and come back, and the game remembers that I activated two pedestals and which spheres I used
* When I come back the only sphere left is the one on the Hinox, and the only pedestal is the one on top of the mountain
* I'm so sad"

And the way to 'give up' is to just travel away from the island until the disembodied voice asks if you're going to continue or not. If you confirm that you're giving up, you're actually transported away from the island. I got transported to the shrine on that big nearby hill/cliff (where I assume most people jump from to paraglide to the island in the first place). You get your original stuff back but retain nothing you collected.

When you come back to the island, the voice gives the exact same spiel, and you're forced to start with nothing again. If you return too soon though, any resources you recently harvested will still be gone (I was very annoyed to find this out). But like I said, it remembers which pads are activated.

Also, good news! It took me a couple of damn hours, but I was able to use a little grassy hill half-way up the mountain as a ramp to stasis-boost the sphere. Thank god I made it before all my weapons broke.

And in the end all you get is a spirit orb and a gold rupee. Sigh."
