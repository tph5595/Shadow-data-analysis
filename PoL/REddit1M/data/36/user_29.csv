16704,"So about those Yiga Clan people

[I've been randomly encountering them seemingly everywhere since completing the Gerudo story. Is that just something the game does, adds random encounters with Yiga after entering their HQ? I mean, they die in one or two hits so its not much of an issue, but its a bit jarring to be walking around randomly encounter one. Is this some glitch? Is there a sidequest I need to do to make it stop?] (/spoilers)"
