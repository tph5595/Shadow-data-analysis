17854,"The five flames one is pretty tricky. Bringing some fire of your own may help.

The korok forest one: Everything you need is inside the shrine. Reading the clue again may give you a good perspective."
18461,have you talked to the guy who gave the quest? I found his hints to be really good.
19180,"And you've tried at night? 

I mean, I know where it is, and I know that the clues in game were enough to find it, so it's hard to give more hints than that without explicitly telling you where it is. 

The entire area you are in is a beach, so if you're only looking very close to the water then that might be holding you back."
19789,No. She's quite helpful to you in your current state.
23123,Fairies don't spawn once you have 3-6 in your inventory.

Tried to get as many angles as I could for you. There is a second memory with the same dress, which helped. Good luck!"
24937,"No, the displays in your house are all there is. "
27728,"Yes, there is one for that region. Are you having trouble finding it?"
39985,"I'm not sure if the other answer really answered your question. When you get to the spot where the picture was taken, there will be a small glowing circle on the ground. Walk into it to get the memory.

You don't need to find the painter guy if you want to hunt down the memories yourself. All of the pictures can be found through exploration."
40200,It unlocks a more useful quest line.
45124,"It loads your last save, and you can leave the castle and continue playing."
47636,"Your last save is before you fight Ganon, so he is still there. There is no post-Ganon gameplay."
63977,"This may sound redundant, but try going to each location one more time. I've seen this problem twice, and both times it was resolved by this."
65590,"It's a strange bug for sure. Maybe the game doesn't recognize him as having left a spot until you actually go there and see that he's not there. 

I guess it's 3-0 on the fix though, glad to hear it worked for you."
66230,"I just made a trip to the island to look for a route to get it up there, with no real luck. All I can think of is using octo balloons or statis to launch it up there. 

I'm curious though, when you say you left and came back - did you just warp out? If so, did you get your stuff back? What happened when you returned? I'm curious because I didn't even try to leave when I did the trial."
67857,"Haha, I was just working on that route with a rock to see if it would work. 

And hey, if it's worth anything to you, it's also 1/120th of your all-shrines reward."
71151,"The ones that look like they have silver manes are ""white-maned."" The ones with darker black-looking manes are ""silver-maned."" I don't really get why, but that's the case when you take their photo. 

Silver-maned are the hardest. It goes red-blue-white-silver."
71512,Cores and Giant Cores drop from guardian stalkers and guardian defenders - the big ones and the flying ones. They are a more rare drop.
