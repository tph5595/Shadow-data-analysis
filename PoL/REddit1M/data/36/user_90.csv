You'll easily make thousands in no time

or go and sell your gems to the gerudo lady in the goron village for about 10% more compared to shops if you've finished the divine beast (although you'll have to keep some if you want to upgrade some gear to tier 4 or reforge unique weapons)"

You'll even have acess to all Amiibos, even unreleased ones if you want all that shiny excusive gear or even 20 hearth wolf link if you don't have TP HD or don't want to grind it"
