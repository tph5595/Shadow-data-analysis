4438,"Holy hell, did you actually get all 385 pictures? I just unlocked the camera last night, I don't know if I'll get all the pictures though. How hard was it?"
4577,"I was playing this game til 4 last night. I tried to do the Major Test of Strength in Hateno Bay, but I got my ass beat pretty hard. As much as I like it, I feel like the weapon durability system really screwed me here. My weapons do so little damage to the guardian and break so quickly. I definitely have enough food to survive the fight, but I'd run out of weapons before I'd be able to kill it."
4609,Can you purchase...385 pictures?
5365,Hm a solid plan. Thanks!
5657,Not a bad idea. My issue was that my weapons break before I get very far. I went through almost half of them (the good ones) and it had only half health. But I will use this technique.
