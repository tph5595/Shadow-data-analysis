My problem: I can't send Kass home. Please help.

I have done all seven shrine quests. I've talked to him each time. I did the non-shrine quest too. I did Kheel's shrine quest (Warbler). So 8 Kass-given quests are in my log, and Kheel's recital quest. I read through his diary. Reset the game, save and quit, waited a bunch of days in-game. He is not going back home. What am I doing wrong?"

Thank you. Somehow, for some *Hylia*-damned reason, that worked. It is 3 am now. What a simple solution huh."
