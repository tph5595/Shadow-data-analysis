25269,Well it's open world and Dark Souls isn't so no shit.
46715,"No. They had a connecting world. It was very linear though because of the game's use of ""gates"" and difficulty. If you were good enough sure, it could be open world but realistically you can only go to areas when you're properly equipped. Even most times in order to reach the next part of the area you need to beat a boss or find a key. It's just not open.

They don't give you the ability to just immediately go to the final boss. Or take on bosses in an order you want. Other than the part after you get the Lordvessel"
