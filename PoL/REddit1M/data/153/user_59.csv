21435,And based on everything we've seen it's the first cheapest built console ever. Meaning it should be the cheapest console ever. 
21723,You're confusing baked in game mechanics with physics and freedom. All games have had these mechanics in 1 way or another. Nintendo just picked the right ones that meshed well with their overall vision. Nothing about BotW has been unique though. 
22351,"Said the million posters a day begging for information on the WiiU version and every single fanboy here recommending a Switch so you can play ""the best version"". Right, Zelda and Nintendo fans don't care about graphics *unless it's a Nintendo console. Then get the newest one for the best Nintendo graphics."
22457,Gets your facts outta here. Nobody wants them. Can't you see that fanboys are frothing and the brigading has begun. 
51059,If being a well made game makes it unique then all these people trashing Horizon Zero Dawn deserve all the downvotes I got. But circlejerk. 
61126,"Trashing Zelda? I said it wasn't doing anything unique. That's true. Its suddenly special because the ground is more slippery when it's wet? Mario had ground physics in Mario 3 on the NES. How super advanced of Zelda to have them 30 years later. Gimme a break. There's nothing special about the physics in this game, period. That doesn't mean it's not going to be a great game. I am just as anxious for my copy as everyone else is but be realistic. Hell, one of the top posts here now is people jerking off to a self made catapult physics that didn't even work properly. "

I already said that Zelda consolidates a lot of neat features from other games and implemented them very well. More often than not that's how we end up with 10/10 games. Im going to play the shit out of this game. Zelda is one of my favourite series of all games. But I'm not going to sit here and pretend that it's anything special or that much of it hasn't been done before. There's a huge difference between originality and excellent implementation. You're too dense to be able to separate the 2. That's not my issue. That's yours. "

And you call my the hypocrite. "
