The largest difference between the two are the exclusive games. Nintendo has unique hardware, a large library of franchises, and the desire to innovate and stand apart from the crowd. With Playstation and Xbox you're going to get fairly similar experiences, with Nintendo you get unique experiences. Nintendo has pretty much proven that they don't want to compete with Sony and Microsoft."
