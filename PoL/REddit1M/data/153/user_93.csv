60554,So?  That doesn't put you in the right for trashing on zelda for the same reason.  That's simple hypocrisy.  Give credit where it's due.  BotW gets due credit when it comes to open world physics.
68574,"Are you really that dense?  I guess no videogame does anything new because they all use 1s and 0s to display objects and references onto a screen.  This whole matter is subjective, and you are taking an asshole stance on it."
75782,"You took things to illogical extremes when you presume BotW is ""unoriginal"" in all facets before even playing it.  I'm all for setting reasonable expectations, that's great.  But to say the game won't do ANYTHING at all original is asinine, but that's your problem, not mine."

Compared to other games?  They were solid.  Therein lies Zelda's legacy."
85873,"Don't put words in my mouth.  I never made those assumptions.

I'm calling out your bullshit because you say there's nothing original in this game.  ""Original"" is a subjective term, which I mentioned before but you failed to comprehend reading.  Original on what grounds?  If there's borrowed elements, even if there's unique spins put on it, does that not make it original?  I've seen lots of that in this game so far, such as using stasis to launch a metal block while being attached to it, hitting an enemy and making an entrance into battle, in an open world adventure game.  

Borrowed elements =\= unoriginal."
