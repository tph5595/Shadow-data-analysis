12124,"Or maybe not everyone likes Zelda? Not everything needs to be a ""shill conspiracy""."
49755,What did he say that's false? The framerate does chug a bit when in television mode. The game does run at a lower resolution than normal. Maybe the only thing that can't be proven right now is the AI since very few people even have access to the game.
49909,"What gives you the right to say that someone's **opinions** are bad because you don't like their reasons? Does that give me the right, if you were to say that LTTP is the greatest game of all time, for me to say that you're wrong because the game is too pixelly? That's why they're **opinions** in the first place because everyone has a different **opinion**."
50003,"He saying that people should look deeper than ""oh it's Zelda it's great"". Look at the mechanics in the game, look at the story of the game, then decide if it's great. Don't say a week before it's in a majority of peoples hand that ""oh it's Zelda it's great""."
50051,Finally someone else reasonable in this thread. I wonder how many people even realize that the EiC likely won't be the person reviewing the game.
50405,He is using actual plausible facts to support why he doesn't like the game. The game does run at lower resolutions than your standard AAA game. The game does chug while in TV mode. The only fact we can't really back up is the AI being bad because of the hardware is because we haven't played it and haven't seen proof of it.
