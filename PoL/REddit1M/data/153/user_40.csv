13668,"Wow, in every thread I see you in, you pretty much contradict yourself in every statement in your salty, vain efforts to insult the Switch/Zelda. I guess I'll have to explain why your statement is so hypocritical; you state it might be their opinion, but then you state that the Switch is outdated and overpriced. You know that the Switch is more like a handheld that can be a home console right? That is super impressive to me. Perhaps to someone who only likes home console gaming it's not that impressive, but in my opinion it's very impressive, but I suppose that anything that is positive about Zelda/Nintendo Switch is a bad opinion to you? Please learn to logic and stop being hypocritical."
13824,That's good to hear. The only thing I want is a fair review for this game. From what I've seen based on preview videos and other things most of my worries from before were unfounded and this game is looking amazing. I'm sure that if reviewed fairly it'll score extremely high because it actually looks that good.
