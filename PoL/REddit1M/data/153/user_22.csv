8921,"Man, I must withhold judgement about BotW until I have played it so I will take the review at face value until then. But HOW does any person who has played video games for more than 10 minutes in their life give The Order 1886 an 8.5?? Its redeeming qualities are ""graphics"" and ""the disc fits in the PS4 disc slot"""

9572,"That's a pretty thinly veiled shot at the switch itself. I've read reviews that have criticized AI, but I don't think I've ever seen a reviewer link it back to hardware limitations, usually they just stick to the effectiveness of the game itself"
