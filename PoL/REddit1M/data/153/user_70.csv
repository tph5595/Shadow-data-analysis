Love the part about the AI though, when everyone know that it's the biggest flow in HZD."
33834,"The good thing is that no one seems to agree with him in the comments.

And btw Pine looks like shit.

33981,"Also he totally omitted all the people who never played any Zelda games and don't care about the series but will still buy a Switch for this game, because it looks that good."
37634,"Actually, he didn't criticize the artistical direction, he was only talking about technical criteria. 

But I agree with you statement."
37723,"I like my PS4 very much but I would not say I love it. 
Our relationship is not there yet."
37835,"Yeah, but even if you dislike something it doesn't mean that you can say false shit about it, especially when your opion can influence a lot of people. 

Oh wait..

A true AI would take lots of resources because it would have to be able to learn what to do by itself. Obviously, it not the case for a video game AI.

What we call AI is usually a scripted thing. Like ""how do I react when this happens"". If the script is simple, ther will be, I don't know, one or two situations and it won't take any power to be processed by the machine. 

If the script is compex, however, it could lead to a great amount of situations like ""I don't have any weapon, what do I do ? Do I throw rocks ? Do I take my arm ? Do I flee ?"" This takes processing power because it has to check every situation to choose wich one is the better for it.

But you're right in a way. If the AI is well designed, this doesn't take to much power. "
77039,"Let me rephrase that: no one is complaining about the IA in any of the previews I saw (and I watch a lot of them), I saw frame-rate drops, yes, I saw things pop out, yes, but I didn't hear, nor read, anything about the AI being buggy, when every review I read about HZD points that out.

So yeah, I feel like he tries a lot to hate the game, just because it's not a PS4 game."
