357,"Typically I would say that's fair, but an 8.5 to No Man's Sky is pretty telling of how that site operates. I went into No Man's Sky super positive and excited despite all the hate it was getting, but good God was that the most boring thing I've ever played. It was a baaad game."
12926,"That just isn't true. We can already see from all the gameplay shown that this is the most free, interactive open-world that gaming has maybe ever seen."
13264,"Point to me another open-world game of this scale, with this insane of a physics engine in it."
13379,If you say so lol. I've seen enough to be pretty positive I won't be.
13494,"I'm speaking specifically of the interactivity of the environment, though. With what we've seen in the last few days, the interactivity of this environment and AI are on another level."
13887,"GTA V lets you do all sorts of thing with vehicles and signs, and the AI aren't particularly bright. I loved GTA V a lot, but the interactivity just isn't the same. W3 is also fantastic, but the environment is definitely not as interactive as what we've seen from BotW. I'm not trashing either game, I love them both. And I'm not even necessarily saying BotW is a better game. But its world is arguably the most alive we've ever seen."
14225,And that is completely fair :)
