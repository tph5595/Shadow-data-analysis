77434,"I mean I understood it back in the day when there were Sega fanboys and Nintendo fanboys. That was before video games were a mainstream big business industry.

With Sony and especially Microsoft in the picture the industry is not the same. There used to be a time when I would never own a non Nintendo system. First one I got was a dreamcast.

Now I've gotten a 360 and One to go with every Nintendo console. But I'll never buy a Sony machine.

Those bastards.
