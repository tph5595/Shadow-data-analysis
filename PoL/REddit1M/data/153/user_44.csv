Both are quality games and Witcher has a beautifully realized world, but neither of those games offer a level of interactivity with the game world even close to what we've seen so far with BotW. The environment has little to no effect on your gameplay experience in the 2 titles you've just mentioned. In BotW, the physics and dynamic environment can entirely change your approach to anything from combat to navigation. 

In the middle of a thunderstorm? Better not think of climbing too far because the rain will make you slip and better take off that metal armor while you're at it. Maybe you wanna toss that damaged iron sword at a moblin to direct lightning towards the enemy encampment. Or maybe you wanna sneak in and stealth kill them since the rain dampens your footsteps.

I hope this isn't a case of me just riding the hype train, but I really don't think we've seen such a dynamic open-world in gaming before."

Things like stasis and general stuff we've seen (rolling boulders or felling trees) combined with the various systems Nintendo's packed in gives the player the freedom to approach any gameplay situation a variety of ways. Every area is also available for the player as soon as they leave the plateau. Obviously, I haven't played it, but everyone who has touches on the point that freedom, exploration, and experimentation are the heart of this game. 

What it seems like to me is that this game achieves uniqueness, not by any individual mechanics, but by its cohesive and polished whole. It's a bunch of open-world/ sandboxy tropes, but with the Nintendo polish and attention to detail. Luckily, we'll all find out if it lives up to the hype in a couple of days."
