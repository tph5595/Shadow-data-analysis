52564,"&gt; This is a site that gave Horizon a perfect score 

Is that game actually terrible...? From the early reviews everyone has a raging hard-on for Horizon, so I don't see how that is either unusual or unwarranted."
52690,I'm unsure how thick a pair of rose-tinted glasses can be when playing a new game with an entirely new formula for the first time can be.
52757,"Not really. That analogy would make sense if you required a specific brand of TV to watch Hollywood movies and another to watch Marvel movies.

I'm not saying console fanaticism makes any sense, though."
52890,"I don't know about the scale (of the world map(s)) but MGS V had insane gameplay depth. I don't expect Zelda to surpass it. Come close to it or _maybe_ even tie with it, but not surpass it."
57561,"I would argue that it's both because of giving players many versatile toolsets, which also seems to be the case from the small amount of info I've heard on BotW, and because the crazy detailed ideas like the puke recording and hold up and everything came not necessarily from Kojima, but were always given a chance to be developed.

Anyone can come up with the kind of crazy stuff you can do in the Metal Gear games. You just need a game director that's ok with taking the chance of spending man hours on putting them in the game, at the risk of those manhours potentially be wasted if the feature needs to be cut."
