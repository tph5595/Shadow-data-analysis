For those of us who grew up on this series and continue to love it, as the next step in the series BoTW potentially represents what many have wanted for years. While many will fall in love with the game and likely hold it in their hearts as the greatest of all time, many will be disappointed with it and both sides will discredit the other's view as being blinded by nostalgia or unfairly judged based upon unrealistic expectations fueled by pre-launch overhyping.

While the article is super biased and definitely places too much emphasis on the technical aspects of the game, I feel like that sentence does a pretty good job of describing biase on the opposite end of the spectrum."
