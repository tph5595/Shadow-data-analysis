26551,"I have never ever ever understood how people have trouble with the motion controls in skyward sword. 

I've played that game on 2 different systems in 4 different rooms/tvs and every single time it worked so well. 

It always amazed me how fucking good the sword swinging worked. It was the first and only game I've ever played that made me actually feel like the main character. It got me so invested in it. I just loved that game. It's hard to hear what you think about it. "
