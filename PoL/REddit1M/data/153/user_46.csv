The world is packed from what most sources (except the one in this post) say. Of course it has to have stretches of open area as any real world does. Nobody wants a game that feels like a carnival with something at literally every square inch. The open air and scenery need to be displayed, and they are. It's not empty by any means if nearly all previews are to be believed. 

As for the Switch itself, some like it some don't. Your history says a strong no. That's cool and all, but you don't need to reiterate over and over. We get it. 

I just find its portability, and simplicity in playing with friends appealing. Nintendo's 1st party games will make it a hit console with 3rd party games to keep people entertained in-between. I feel like it will be a great success.

You can't look at the Switch the same as other consoles. It's just different. Nobody is buying the Switch to play Call of Duty. 

My main point here is keep an open mind. But if you aren't going to be open to productive debate, then don't seek out Switch posts and spew nonsense bashes into them. "
