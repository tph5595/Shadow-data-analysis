13185,That is a hyperbole if I ever saw one. 
13384,GTA 5 has a very interactive physics system. Witcher 3 isnt as physics heavy but is certainly vast in scale and content. 
13592,"GTA V lets you do all sorts of shit in the game world. So does W3. Its great for a Zelda game, but it isnt the most advanced thing we have ever seen in gaming. Thats just silly. "
14144,"&gt;But it's world is arguably the most alive we've ever seen.

I disagree. "
53325,"The AI isnt anything special, there are games with far more advanced AI."
60399,"&gt; They learn from you.

That is absurd. They are certainly better than every previous Zelda title but they do not learn from you, and they are nothing to write home about. Its good AI for Zelda, but its nothing special at all. "
61876,Dont even bother man. Fan boys gonna fan boy. Zelda is my favorite series but I am not going to put it on pedestal like whats going on in this thread right now. Will it be great? Absolutely. Are the systems in the game the best/most advanced they've ever been for a Zelda game? Yes. Are they more complex/interactive than any game out there now? Fuck no. 
63472,"That isnt advanced AI at all, and it isnt a self learning AI. "
