57797,Add me as well.  The only Nintendo console I've ever owned is the N64.  On that I only owned 3 games.  I've never been a Nintendo fan.  However the Wii U had some great couch co op games (from watching on youtube :) ) and I intend to get a Nintendo console to play games with my daughter.  The Switch looks great - and Zelda looks beautiful from the gameplay I've seen.
