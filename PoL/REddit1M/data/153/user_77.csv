44796,Can we all take a moment to enjoy the fact that no one in the world will be surprised that a magazine for PlayStation games started their review obsessing over graphics and visuals?
44842,I read a review somewhere which said that the arc of the arrows in BotW makes Horizon's bow feel like a bland low tech sniper rifle.
45396,"But it looked extremely not-antiquated, high resolution showed both in models and textures, effects weren't poor, and make textures and environments look even less flatter. and when played on a TV frame rate it was really good due to the hardware not struggling with the higher resolution."

45570,They'll stick a massive spoiler in the first sentence and try and drag down the Meta-critic score.
