46842,"Ok, it IS the PS 4 and XBone's competition, but SO WAS THE WII. Power means NOTHING to Nintendo. Here's what I can say to you any why I will be buying a Switch. Also, it isn't FAR less powerful, but it is less powerful. 

Have you ever tried to bring a PS4 with you on a trip? I have and it is obnoxious. It takes up almost all of your space in your suitcase. Now a Switch? I could fit it in my pocket. I could take the Switch anywhere. Aside from being a home console, the Switch is the most powerful handheld EVER. The ability to play Zelda on the go is an extreme advantage. Sure, the Vita did something similar, but not in HD, and they aren't sold anymore anyway. There are concerns about the Switch, but to anyone else who would say this, $300 for a game-changing system is not overpriced. It is completely reasonable. 

EDIT: The Wii was the PS3 and XBOX 360's competition. My comment made it sound like the Wii was competing was competing with this generation. My point is that power does not equal sales. The PS3 was very powerful, but it was horribly marketed. It still sold well, but compared to the much less powerful Wii, it underperformed. Power does not equal sales."
46989,"Dude, why are you here if all you do is crap on Zelda?"
47450,"I think the reason people are upset is that it will falsely lower the the Metacritic score of BotW because the guy is a shill. Fortunately, he doesn't seem to be the one reviewing. "
47607,"Apparently, this dude gave The Order: 1886 an 8.5. Never played it so I can't judge it, but by all accounts (professional and user reviews) the game sucked.  "
47771,"Yeah, Horizon is supposed to be good, but this douche has to take a dump all over Zelda because not as many people will play Horizon because of Zelda. "
48386,"You're cherry picking. Mario Kart 8 was the best Mario Kart ever. Bayonetta 2, while not a Nintendo developed game, was published by Nintendo and literally everyone loved it. Gamespot, one of the more persnickety game reviewers, gave it a perfect score. Sure, Pokemon is samey, but Sun and Moon aren't at all. They completely overhauled the series in almost every imaginable way. Super Smash Bros is samey, but no one hates it because of it. And why are you hating on Super Mario 3D World? That is one of the most fun games I've ever played. Disregarding that, Super Mario Galaxy 1 &amp; 2 are once every couple of generation type games. 

I like Sony games too, but don't hate without solid evidence. "
48506,"What you are doing isn't healthy. You're just being pedantic because you can. 

And since we're being pedantic, it's spelled cynicism. "
52404,"Yesh the issue isn't his opinion. The issue is he's a shill. Geez, where does he get off?
"
52613,"Agreed. I freaking love Witcher 3 and I have to admit, exploration is not the focus of the game. It is truly gorgeous and, my gosh, Novigrad is amazing, but the world is minimally interactive. Not a criticism, because that isn't the focus of the game. BotW is very much focused on exploration by contrast."
52820,"They aren't saying it's the most amazing thing ever, just that the AI is phenomenal (a specific critique of the original topic of discussion) and world is very ineractive."
53388,"Yeah, the concept sounds cool, but that was just a stupid thing to say by the reviewer. Apparently the game is pre-alpha, so how could you even compare the animations to a fully developed game? Also, Pine *clearly* has some Zelda (even BotW) influence. So saying ""Hey, this game is better than Zelda"" is ridiculous. Their review is bad and they should feel bad."
53525,SAD!
54315,"Someone above said that they have two reviewers who seem genuinely unbiased and give unbiased reviews. But the guy who is reviewing Zelda is NOT one of them. He seems to have an axe to grind and except for *maybe* the issues on TV mode, the arguments aren't even arguments. They are just a guy saying ""I won't give Zelda a pass because it's Zelda"". That is literally a guy being a jerk just because he can be."
55074,"He didn't say the game ran at a lower resolution than normal. He said, and I quote ""The game looks extremely antiquated..."" He basically said the game looks ugly, a sentiment shared by exaclty no reviewers who have played the game. He also said things like ""playing Zelda feels like a massive step back in basically every aspect."" Sure that is an opinion, but it sounds like some jerk is just giving it a bad review because no one else is. Like when the Washington Post gave Uncharted 4 a 4/10 when everyone else gave it great scores. In fact, he basically goes on to say that LATER IN THE REVIEW. ""And yes, while Pine isn't even a super-advanced game, there are multiple aspects of its visual presentation that easily surpass Zelda, which is fairly sad, considering the massive difference in budget and resources.
**Not everyone will give Zelda a pass because it's Zelda.**"" He bascially said, in more words, everyone else is giving Zelda heaps of praise, but not me! None of the things he criticized are core elements of the game and it looks as though he is trying to be a douche. Never mind that Pine isn't even finished and that it looks like it is borrowing heavily from Zelda. Forget that the animations are vastly inferior to those of BotW. The GRAPHICS, man. If you love graphics so much, PS4 isn't even the best option. I recommend getting a gaming PC.

Tl;dr: The guy isn't even making arguments. He is just saying that the game is ugly and the gameplay is dated without citing any specific examples of how this is the case."
55360,Pretty sure Giant Bomb gave the game a perfect score too.
56530,"The AI seem very smart. They learn from you. I've seen a [Moblin pick up and throw a skeleton at Link because that was the only weapon they had available.](/spoiler) No one is saying that the game has the best AI ever. How could any game make that assertion with so many games out there? We are just saying that the game has a pretty great AI and that the reviewer, for some reason, said that the reason is the hardware, which is one of the dumbest things I've ever heard."
60005,"Not for BotW. I was talking about Horizon. And yes, their review for Horizon is out, and it is a [10](http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/horizon-zero-dawn-review/1900-759/)."
62676,"In this article, the author details his interactions with Bokoblins, the most basic enemies in the game. The Bokoblins will not take your crap. If you aren't going to engage, weaponless Bokoblins will pick up rocks and start throwing them at you. One of them stuck his spear into fire, thus creating a flaming weapon. Don't believe me? [Here you go.](http://www.zeldainformer.com/dynamic-ai-in-breath-of-the-wild/)

62939,"Doesn't matter, apparently. Some people think the AI is simplistic and while ""good for a Zelda game"" is nothing special. Just enjoy the game and ignore the haters, because they are there, even in this sub."
66236,"That isn't news, it's opinion. And basically as soon as the BotW release date was announced, people were concerned that Horizon would not sell as well. BotW is probably a system seller for many. Not sure that the same could be said about Horizon, but such a thing is esoteric and hard to define, I admit."
67369,DUDE. That is super douchey. I don't ever want a game people are excited for to suck. It was heartbreaking watching people who were super excited for NMS to see all of their excitement to be unfounded. I don't know what you're on about.
67684,"BECAUSE IT ISN'T OBJECTIVELY BETTER. There are TONS of people who said that Horizon pales in comparison to BotW. Don't get me wrong. Horizon is supposedly a really good game. But they are two VERY different games in two VERY different settings. Why can't people enjoy both? I have been a huge Zelda fan for most of my life and is without question my favorite franchise. Horizon is a game by a developer who has done mostly shooters up until now. Pardon me for sticking with my favorite game series over an unproven (at this point) game series.

AND it isn't the only game available that people are excited about. Namely, people think Snipperclips looks like a lot of fun."
68350,"No, it isn't terrible. It's apparently really good. The reason OP mentioned it is because a Sony focused site seems to be (not difinitively) gave Horizon a perfect score, but seems to be hating on Zelda for no other reason than because it's Zelda."
69014,"Exactly. Terrible logic to use for this. You know why Nintendo ""has is easier with reviewers""? Because they have a reputation of making good games. When bad games get released, Nintendo does get heat for it."
81047,Ok I should say that I found his reasons to be unsatisfactory. He just sounded salty to me.
