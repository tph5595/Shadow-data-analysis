45650,"""It's bad because graphics aren't 4k and framerate isn't smooth 249fps.The actual gameplay?Nah, that doesn't matter it doesn't have realistic graphics and such isn't a good game, obviously.""

The idiocy is so astounding."
45848,That's the joke.
45875,"You're not a fanatic, I'm happy you aren't."
45998,"Of course not, but the reasons they gave are atrocious."
46045,"Ironically, PlayStation doesn't hold a candle to PC."
46092,Yet he gave 8.5 for both the Order 1866 and No Man's Sky.
46167,"Of course it, but the reasons he gave are atrocious."
46230,"Yet they couldn't keep their fanboyism in their pants this time, what happened?"
46308,"What we've seen of performance is on par with PS4, so by your words the PS4 is an overpriced and outdated piece of horse shit."
46399,"Bag of shit?Where are you getting these from?What are you even talking about?

And what do you mean they get away with shit, remember Star Fox Zero? Federation Force?
Fuck off with that logic."
50126,"But the thing is, to explain an opinion with objective facts like he is doing, they would have to be actual plausible facts.

If he had just said 'I don't like this game', then that would be an opinion, but he's trying to use extremely stupid arguments to validate it;This is extremely unprofessional and should have been done away with as soon as possible.

A review isn't opinions, it's taking facts from the game and attempting to rate it through these facts."
51895,"Those are real problems, but saying the game is bad because of only these problems that most games have these days (Including the 10/10 Horizon ZD) is complete bullshit."
122767,"That's due to poor optimizing on the game's part, the Switch runs all other games at a smooth 1080p 60fps at all times."
122925,"Try making a review that's just 'This game is shit in my opinion', without giving reasons.

You'd be the laughing stock of the industry."
139975,"Exactly, but those reasons need to be objective and not shit like 'I didn't like it because Link wasn't a Ginger'.

A review is supposed to inform people about a game and help them decide whether to buy it or not, and to do this a review can't have atrocious reasons like this.Sometimes you have to look at it objectively and seperate fact from preference."
