10179,"Sony fanboys place graphics above all else, when it's actually one of the least important things when you're considering how good a game is. 

Funny thing is, BotW is a lot easier on the eyes than the generic ""realistic"" graphics they seem to prefer. 

Nintendo isn't afraid to think outside the box, including graphically. That's why their first party offerings are always superior. That's why my Wii U is used daily while my XBOX collects dust. Only PlayStation I ever owned was the original. 

So salty.  "
