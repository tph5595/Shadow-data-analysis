51448,"I am what I consider a ""Great Pretender"" when it comes to the Zelda series. I have played every single game in the series outside of Skyward Sword, and you know what? I've never completed a single one. Not once. I've never even reached the Master Sword in a Link to the Past, and I've been playing that game nearly 20 years. On and off of course. 

And even -I- am buying a Switch and BotW. It looks impressive in every way, technical to otherwise.

This guy attacked Zelda, and it's fans, because he had nothing else to stand on. There was no platform for this bad review other than ""lol fanboys/fangirls"". Terrible journalism."
