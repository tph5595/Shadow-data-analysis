Honestly I don't care about the visuals as much as other people. Never seen such a refined fantasy survival game and I'm archly excited for it.

I really don't understand the logic that it will get a pass because it's Zelda. 

If a game sucks it sucks, and its already got multiple 10 outta 10s anyway.

Also I didn't get horizon yet because I would just be neglecting it for zelda XD

It's all about that gameplay!! That and story is what should merit a game!"
