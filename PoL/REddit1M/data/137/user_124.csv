Either version is fine but SNES would be my preferred version."
28256,The fan-hack [Parallel Worlds](http://www.vizzed.com/videogames/snes/screenshot/Zelda%20Parallel%20Worlds-3.png) runs well on an actual SNES with a blonde Link. Maybe it limits the colours in other areas but I'm sure Nintendo didn't have to use pink hair - not for that reason anyway.
74420,"I think you're right about that.

Not SNES but the reason Sonic &amp; Knuckles can't connect to Sonic 1 is because they'd have to replace blue with red everywhere and not just on the player sprite itself. Because the palette is shared.

But my point is that there are workarounds. Nintendo didn't strictly have to make the hair pink for that reason.

At the time they were putting out the most polished games. It doesn't seem like them to compromise like that - especially with the player sprite, which is very important because it's literally always on screen. It's guesswork - but I'd say there must have been other reasons for the choice."
