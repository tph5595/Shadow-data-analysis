50817,"Shit. Now this means I really have to get the 3ds. There are so many games coming out that I want to play on it! The oracle games were my favorite! Do I dare invest in the animal crossing 3ds xl....or what? (I like animal crossing too..)

I hate to ask, but is there any other difference between the 3ds and its xl version other than screen size? Or which does anybody recommend?"
97248,How much bigger is the screen on the xl than the 3ds?
