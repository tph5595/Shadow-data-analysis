12360,I love that they're using the classic brown-haired Link rather then the Windwaker blonde Link which has been in every top-down Zelda game since Windwaker.
117404,"I'm talking about the Windwaker child Link, though. He's been in all the gameboy/DS games so far. Even the Re-release of Link to The Past/Four Swords Adventures combo for gameboy advance had Windwaker link with his sounds as a replacement for LTTP Link."
