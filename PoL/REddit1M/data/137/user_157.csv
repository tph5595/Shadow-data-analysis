57170,"&gt;remastering oot isn't lazy

&gt; making brand new game with new mechanics whose style and aesthetics are simply reminiscent of alttp is lazy

sorry your logic doesn't make sense to me at all. There's nothing particularly interesting or impressive about OoT being on the 3DS whatsoever."

I also sort of wish they hadn't taken so many artistic cues from AlttP. I mean, it's a nice homage, but I would have really liked a different art style at least."
