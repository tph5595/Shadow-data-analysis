28926,Well if it is coming before Lttp then it will be a game about the sealing war between the 7 sages and ganon. Which would be soo epic. But as far as I know I don't think that there was a hero in that era so it may not be plausible. But I would still really love that. 
29702,The sealing war happens between OoT and LttP. The reason it happens is because the Hero of Time (link) in OoT fails and is killed. So the 7 sages get together to try and seal Ganon away where as in OoT you slay Ganon and then in the 2 other timelines he gets resurrected.
