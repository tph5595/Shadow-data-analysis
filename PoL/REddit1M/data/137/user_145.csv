Personally I think they should either do a full 3D zelda or a full 2D zelda.
My other complaint is when they attempt to work whatever gimmick the current console is into the game without any thought as to whether or not its a good idea. Obviously I cant say that 3D will be a bad thing, but if they've put in 13 level dungeons just to show off the fancy 3D effects as Link flies between levels it kind of annoys me.

Gimmicks should never have preference over proper gameplay. 

Also they better not put in any sort of travel system into the game. I dont know about anyone else but I've finished every Zelda except for Spirit Tracks and Phantom Hourglass. I just couldnt bear the fact that I had to sail/ride to get anywhere. Skyward sword was kind of bearable but it got so boring in the end.

More content! More caves! More actual stuff that isnt just randomly collecting bugs. LTTP never had random collectables and there was so much still to do.

Any why the hell hasn't Nintendo released Majora's Mask 3DS, seriously, I'd by 100 copies of it just because of how awesome it'd be.

Also Nintendo, why the hell dont you ever try to push the graphics in your games.

Also considering that most people who grew up with Zelda are most likely into their 20s to 40s now why cant we get a more darker zelda with moral choices like Mass Effect(just without the bad ending :P)

Why doesnt Nintendo try to make a Zelda game for PC as well. Sell it on steam and market the shit out of it.

I swear Nintendo's no 1 problem is that its so stuck in a rut and doesnt want to ever push the boundaries any more that it just pumps out the same game over and over again with a slightly different gimmick.
