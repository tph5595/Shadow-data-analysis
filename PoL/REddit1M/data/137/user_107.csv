19792,"I really want this game. Earthbound was just announced as coming out for the Wii U and now I'm torn. I don't want to have to buy both a Wii U and a 3DS. I rarely play with my Wii as it is, I don't need more electronics to sit around collecting dust. I wish they'd release them both on the same platform so I could just get one of them and be done with it. :("
