That said, the touch screen controls really have to have the game designed around them, or there's no point. The items taking advantage of the touch screen was what made the controls work."
69385,There was literally nothing wrong with the Tower of Spirits. It fixed every problem with the Temple of the Ocean King.

The Tower of Spirits had some of the best puzzles in the series, and the stealth in the dungeon was actually fun.
As long as it has great puzzles like the ToS, it would be a great dungeon."
