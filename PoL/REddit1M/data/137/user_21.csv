2133,Did you watch the direct? It takes place in the same world as A Link to the Past. It's even called A Link to the Past 2 in the japan stream. 
2201,You know A Link to the Past is called The Triforce of the Gods in Japan right? This is literally going to be called A Link to the Past 2.
3119,"How is it a placeholder? The game is coming out this year so why would they announce it and call it Triforce of the Gods 2, only to change the name later?"
3898,Go watch the Japan stream. The subtitle is right there under the name: Triforce of the Gods 2.
4668,Why would they even unveil it as Triforce of the Gods 2 then?
5763,"They do, but we don't know right now where this exactly takes place in the timeline. The only info we were told is that it's set in the same world as A Link to the Past so I would assume for now that it's the same Link especially since they're labeling it as a sequel."
27765,It's almost done development. Use your brain.
