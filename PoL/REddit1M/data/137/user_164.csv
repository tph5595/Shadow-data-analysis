And the oracle games are long overdue for porting to a new system, Nintendo just had to clear up licensing with capcom. Wind Waker is an HD remake with a full work over and extra areas not available in the original, and other than that Nintendo is churning out new content: new luigis mansion, new mario kart, new mario, new smash bros etc. So what makes this the ""year of the re-release""?"
