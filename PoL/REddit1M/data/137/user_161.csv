64650,"Totally agree brother. I thought the exact thing as I watched that trailer- they made an effort to show that the 3DS visuals were significant to the game.

I *really* hope that they can (and they provably will) make it so that the 3D plays an integral role in the gameplay. (Like in Super Mario 3D Land, where there were parts of the game where you needed to keep the 3D on to be able to even get past the level)

Forgive my long comment, but I am so stoked for that game."
