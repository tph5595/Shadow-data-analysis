Seriously, they put OOT on the 3DS and it gives you the epicness of a console game in the palm of your hand. I was expecting something with that level of attention and love and feel. I was expecting the perspective of a console Zelda because they PROVED it was possible. And what do they give us? A barely 3D visual painted onto classic Zelda handheld gameplay.

I just feel so let down.

And before people jump on my ass, I KNOW it will be a good game, I KNOW it will be a good *handheld* game but I expect more knowing that Nintendo is capable of OOT on the 3DS.

I'm going to get it, but with the excitement of Spirit Tracks, just waiting for the WW remake for a REAL, FULL, not half-assed Zelda experience."

I got a taste of what an OOT ""sequel"" (in gameplay and desing only not world and story) with the 3D remake and I want more, then they give us this lazy (imo) excuse for a new Zelda, its gonna be like a 9/10 handheld Zelda but only in comparison to handheld games because they are not being ambitious enough with what they have."
11236,"Exactly. It will be a 9/10 handheld game. The keyword being ""handheld"". Its so sad to see them not being ambitious and just being lazy imo. They could create like an OOT or MM sequel in terms of design and gameplay with something that would make you wish you could play the game on consoles, instead we get what I'd consider the equivalent of Four Swords Adventure on the Gamecube.

I'm just disappointed, not even pissed."
12378,"I'm judging the parts I know I can judge: game design, aesthetics, premise. Because they are all in the trailer."
26058,"Like I said, just my opinion. I didn't want to spark a debate I was just so severely disappointed they went the easy, watered down root."
26097,"Those are not mutually exclusive, and it is in a sense lazy, since it is significantly easy making an isometric game."
58012,"How do I clarify this. Remastering OOT wasn't what I was talking about. Rather it was a reference point for what the 3ds was capable of. Remastering is always lazy, I think making a 2d zelda over a full blown 3d one from scratch is lazy and that is what they're doing just with a 3d ""skin"""
80722,"There's nothing wrong as long as you're done with a less then epic game. When you simply rehash a world with better visuals and new dungeons and content you aren't exactly pushing your developing limits. When you use NDS graphics instead of pushing the capabilities of the 3DS even if you choose an isometric view, you are being lazy. "
