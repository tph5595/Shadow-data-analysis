440,"I was expecting a new 3D style Zelda game today, but this looks really great as well! The literal 2D power seems interesting and I wonder how it ties into the story. "
1629,That is an interesting coincidence! That makes me question where this game falls in the timeline. It is styled after ALttP but could it be a distant follow up to Spirit Tracks maybe? 
1982,"That could very well be true as well, as elements of games across other timelines have intermingled.  "
2525,"Yes, I did. I think it will share the same aesthetic and design qualities but won't be the exact same overworld (that would be boring.) The style of the [2D Chalk Link](http://i.imgur.com/va4lABd.jpg) still has me curious though."

3159,Were the touch controls really that awful? I've played both DS Zeldas and never really had any difficulty with them.
3645,"Idk, why wasn't Majora's Mask titled Ocarina of Time 2 when it shared the same aesthetic, had similar gameplay, and had time as a central element? Nothing is really confirmed at this point but I think Nintendo would at least come up with an original name for the game.

Edit: Spelling"
3936,And that's only in 2D power mode too. /u/d3ftw compiled a [larger album](http://imgur.com/a/HcD0t#0) full of screens of the game as well. 
4651,"Did anyone else also notice that the 2D mode seems to use magic power? After he reverts normally, the magic bar seems to regenerate as well.

Edit: Using the Hammer also expended magic. Is it more of a stamina bar this time around?"
5081,"The naming of titles in the series have usually varied between Japan and the US (some of the exceptions being Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword.) 

For example: [Four Swords Adventures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Four_Swords_Adventures) was Four Swords+ in Japan and  [Minish Cap](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Minish_Cap) was The Mysterious Cap."
23956,Maybe they're using the same engine for Super Mario 3D Land for this game? It's not the first time Nintendo has used the same engine for different series. Ie: Ocarina of Time was developed in the Super Mario 64 engine.
