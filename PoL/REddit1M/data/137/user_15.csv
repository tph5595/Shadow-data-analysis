1525,"Probably increase, especially if they stick with it being a sequel to ALttP (as the Japanese placeholder name suggests)."
1566,Chalk Link?
1747,"I would imagine they would want to switch timelines after a while. And even though it's just a placeholder name, *Triforce of the Gods 2* makes it sound like it would be in the Failed Hero timeline."
1809,"Hold out for a 2014 release, friend. They mentioned they *might* do it after a new 3DS title comes out."
2428,"Yes... I know. That's why I said that it would fall in the Failed Hero timeline. It's highly likely that, like I said, *Triforce of the Gods 2*/*A Link to the Past 2* is just a placeholder name for now. It's not ""literally"" going to be called that because they haven't given us a name yet. Sure, it's possible, but we don't know. I think they're doing that just to reinforce the idea that this will be a sequel to ALttP in both story and art."
4080,"Along with what /u/Critic_Kyo said, they don't really have a standard of naming sequels numerically. Even AoL, which was called Zelda II, the ""2"" part of it was de-emphasized and it was given a full subtitle. So while I'm not saying it is impossible for it to be called ALttP2, it's just more likely that it will have a new name that's more appropriate to the game."

If that was the finalized title, they would probably have styled it up rather than just using a basic font. Both Skyward Sword and Spirit Tracks did that. Even though the artwork/design of the logo wasn't final, they still revealed a full logo with the finalized name. With Twilight Princess' reveal they used the logo from OoT with no subtitle. Nintendo has set a precedent for using placeholders for the sake of announcements."
5494,Exactly. The US trailer having no title at all is another thing that makes me think there is no finalized title yet.
