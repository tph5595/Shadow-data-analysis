They weren't that way just because they didn't have the technology to do better, it was an integral part of the franchise. Zelda 2 was the only game up until Ocarina of Time that strayed away from it. Sure, with the technology we have now it seems a little dated, but it has a completely different feel than the fully 3D games. A Link to the Past, Oracle of Ages/Seasons, Link's Awakening and so on weren't limited at all by the fact that they were 2D. They consciously chose to make the games that way for the same reason they choose not to use voice actors for dialogue. It was just how the games were and they stuck with it because it's what fans came to expect. I'm not saying they are better than the 3D games, both styles are good for different reasons, but the 2D isometric games certainly aren't over. It's what the series was built on and sometimes it's good to remind yourself where you came from."

I can understand why you don't like the old format though; as I said before it is pretty dated compared to something like the Ocarina of Time remake. However there is a certain charm to the style, whether it is nostalgia or whatever. Growing up playing those 2D games gave me an appreciation for the subtlety and simplicity of it. There's a reason why so many of the Zelda games were in that 2D isometric style and it's because it worked. Take the Mario games as an example: even with all the advancement in that series they still make 2D side scroller games and they're still just as fun as when I played Super Mario World for the first time on the SNES. I hate to use a cliche, but Nintendo uses the notion of ""If it isn't broke, don't fix it"" just as much as they try to break new ground. I'd much rather have another Link to the Past (which I know is going to be good) than some awful attempt at innovation (ahem, Spirit Tracks).

I guess what I'm getting at is that I can certainly see your point that they should try something new since the technology allows them to. But I see nothing wrong with going back to the old formula every once in a while with the guarantee of an excellent game."
