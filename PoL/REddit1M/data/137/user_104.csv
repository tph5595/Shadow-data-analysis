18852,yea its the year of the re-release 
22034,there was only about 3 unique games there most of them are re-releases or tweaks 
22084,thats how zelda games go usually you either have it in 2d or 3d style + a gimmick 
22113,as long as there is no temple of the ocean king type sections 
93515,all those titles are great and i am excited although they are all 1st party Nintendo games not many 3rd party games they need more 3rd party and mature games to get more people to buy the 3ds or wii u 
93773,i dont want any gimmicky stealth dungeon between levels instead they should just make and extra dungeon 
114161,my favorite part about tp was no stealth sections
