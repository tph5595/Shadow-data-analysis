2315,"For those who are using the Piggyback Guide's Map for the Korok Seeds, were they any missing on that map which you found? Curious as I found one in Hyrule Castle which wasn't listed (I have informed Piggyback about this)"
5236,"Piggyback has the Collector's Guide which comes with a large poster of the map (double sided. One with Shrines/Towers. The other is Korok). It costs Â£24.99/$29.99

"
5298,So no giant spike balls follow you down?
6116,They don't become white/silver. There are set places for each type of Lynel. I can vouch for this as I was in Hyrule Castle and fought bought a White and a Blue one
6496,I would recommend talking to Nintendo Support. Sounds like a hard/firmware issue rather than a game having a bug
6546,I don't think there are places if I recall. I think you only ever need 2
6789,"That is strange. I will have a look around my world.

And yes there was a Blue one in the castle. But it's a small room so assume it will be hard"
7761,The one in the central square fountain sounds like a race. If I recall the race starts somewhere on the Hyrule Castle Town Ruins gate
8032,"Well I have all the Beasts, Shrines and less than 30 seeds to pick up. And I am still seeing Lynels of different colours. I think it might be how many of them you slay"
8584,I will check if Zora's Domain is still a red one
9306,You are very welcome! You will need as much help as you can for Hyrule Castle. It's a dozy!
9791,I noticed a lot of Wizzrobes to the north-east-east of the Central Tower region. They were in what looked to be the hollowed out trunks of massive trees
12765,"1) I recommend avoiding for now. Experience the game more and eventually it will click. I recall coming back in 20 hours play time and I was whopping them big time

2) Upgrading armour

3) Zora is definitely a good one to start with. Mipha's power will help you greatly in your journey"
13754,What misinformation did you find?
13791,"Actually that is true. I guess the only way to decide is by asking each player if they die too much. If they do, they best go to Zora"
25913,"Of all the *insert rude word*

I have 899 Korok Seeds and the last seed is a group of three trees with apples. One of them is refusing to spawn the apple. Can anyone help me by telling how to respawn this apple?"
27740,It has already been a blood moon since. I remember as I was in the north-western area when it happened. So a blood moon isn't the reason behind a respawn
