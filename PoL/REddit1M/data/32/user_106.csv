42435,There's a shrine behind two large cliffs by Lake Kilsie in the north west region and I cannot figure out how to get to it. There is a tiny sliver between the two cliff sides where I can see the shrine but I can't fit in that space. I'm not sure if I'm just dumb and can't figure it out or this snowstorm is blocking my view of an important clue but I cannot figure out how to get to this shrine. 
46700,I found the entrance as soon as I posted here. 
50378,Lmfao I actually had Link take all his armor and clothes off to see if he could squeeze through but I just ended up being cold and naked in the snow :(
