6279,"I'm praying this is just a weird glitch that I've happened to come across but I have a fear that maybe my gamepad is going bad.. but..

So I was in the Ze Kasho shrine which has another frustrating gyro-based puzzle (two, in fact).  I had just barely managed to finish the last one in that shrine using the gamepad after 15 minutes of frustration.  As soon as the normal Zelda ""did something right"" chime happened, I hit a button on my pro controller to switch back.....and that's when the camera decided it wanted to shoot up to the ceiling and spin in circles.  Nothing I did could stop it.  I switched back to the gamepad and tried to move using the two joy sticks and nothing.  I tried to tap the middle to switch the game TO the gamepad and it wasn't working at all.  The game literally was stuck spinning the camera in a circle staring at the ceiling.

At this point I was just aggravated so I shut the game off.  I came back later and of course had to do the shrine again. Switched to the pro controller immediately and it seemed OK.  Went to the first switch and pulled out my bow to hit and then the camera went wonky again when aiming at the crystal.  This time I was able to kind of force it to work but every time I tried to aim the camera went bonkers on me.

Now it's been a day or two since I did the shrine and I've been running around trying to collect stuff and every so often the camera just goes stupid on me.  It's happening on both the pro and gamepad controllers. Anyone have any ideas wtf is going on?  It's making the game a little annoying to play.  And it's only happened since that weird glitch inside that shrine.  Before that I had played the game 60+ hours without any issues what so ever.  Now it's happening every few hours minimum.  "
