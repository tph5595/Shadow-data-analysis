1636,"It only *uses* one of your arrows, but it is in fact shooting three projectiles of equal damage in quick succession. 

Is it the Lynel bow?"
1832,"Definitely find Kakariko and Hateno villages if you haven't yet. After that, focus on finding towers to build your map.

Without spoiling everything, you should find the 4 main areas easily where the divine beasts are when you have a more complete map"
2070,"I assume you were trying to respond to my arrow comment?

If so, yes. Assuming you land all three shots.

if you look carefully you should be able to see the three arrows one after another. Some 3x bows shoot three arrows in a horizontal spread though I've noticed"
2102,Master Sword beam enhancements. Nothing else I am aware of
4842,"Agreed. No Deku Babas, no Darknuts, etc.

Slightly disappointed that they kind of resorted to just making different colored Bokoblins, but there still a good amount of variety I guess"
8031,"Lynel bows that I've been picking up have been weaker per shot compared to other bows, but they do a TON of damage if you can land all three arrows in a point blank head shot. 

Don't beat yourself up"
20536,Gotta get those bananas tho
20717,"That seems like it would get annoying...I tend to use my bow at medium/close range, so I guess the sniper may be good for picking off enemies on towers and stuff before raiding camps"
20957,The Master Sword is also in a pretty typical location if you've played previous Zelda games
21086,I know exactly which monster you're talking about. Wow I never thought to stand on top of him
21184,Pretty sure there is only one piece on the great plateau (assuming you're not counting the gear you get upon waking up)
21303,"Sneak into a Bokoblin camp at night to steal weapons. If you need one immediately, several of the towns have weapon spawns every blood moon or so to hold you over in the mean time "
21357,There is a common bug which is causing frequent blood moons. Everyone that I've talked to said they've fixed it by doing a hard power down on their console 
21389,There is one in Hateno village leaning against the house that the construction people are working on
