. But , can someone please give me a very very vague answer to this question ? (***Minor spoilers follow***)

So I made it to Vah Ruta.  This is my first dungeon, I don't have any really cool handy items yet or anything.  I got the first couple of terminals, and I made it to the room with the 2 big gears.  I got the one with the waterfall turning it, but you know the big gear that's not turning that also has a chest and a locked terminal and a thing you can hit ?  I can't figure out that puzzle, and I can't seem to continue any further in the dungeon either.

All I wanna know is : at this current stage of the game, can I solve this puzzle and continue?  Or, should I leave and do something else first and I'll eventually find the item or skill I need later?**** Please don't answer with the actual solution,******* i just want to know if I'm wasting my time trying , haha

Thank you!!!!"

Ive been at this for about an hour and I don't see it.  But I'll keep trying! If I really get stuck I'll post again here for the solution. Thanks again for the answer "
