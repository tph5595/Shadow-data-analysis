38165,"Sorry bit of a random question. Several months ago during E3 I believe Nintendo stated the demo area (Great Plateau?) only represented 1% of the total map (link: http://www.polygon.com/e3/2016/6/15/11950594/legend-of-zelda-breath-the-wild-e3-2016-demo-one-percent-nintendo-wii-nx)

Is that really the case?"
