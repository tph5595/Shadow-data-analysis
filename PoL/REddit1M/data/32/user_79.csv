Try playing around with the water and more of your runes, it can lead you to figuring out things you may have forgotten or overlooked.

I did the Ruta as my first Divine Beast and I was able to complete it and get all the chests~"
28632,I've fallen for the 'how did I not see something so obvious' trap many times in this game as well so far. So don't worry too much about it!
28843,"I've got a question about the Great Fairy Fountains.

So I've unlocked a few of them but haven't upgraded my armor on any of them either. However I have seen a lot of people talking about upgrading their armor sets here to their max.

How does the armor upgrading work? I see from the Faries' explanations that it requires materials, but what does it actually do to the armor? Is it temporary or a permanent upgrade? Can you do it only a limited amount of times or is it unlimited if you have the necessary materials?"
29362,"Ah, so it can be done an unlimited amount of times as long as the armor has not been upgraded 4 times?

Just want to make sure there is no limit or 'you have to chose this over this' kinda thing. &gt;.&lt;"
29487,"Man, I could have survived quite a few more battles had I known this earlier. I didn't want to do the upgrade incase I could only do it a few times.

Ah well, it added to my experience. Thanks for the answer!"
31475,"Ok, I see it now. Thank you for letting me know. I can get right to upgrading then since I'm still walking around with the un-upgraded armor~"
31784,"Its the first thing I have planned when I next play now, don't worry!

Now I understand why the armor numbers felt so low and why some people in videos took minuscule damage compared to me in the same armor as I have."
