"
4069,I have to admit I am surprised to see that there aren't Darknuts. Would be fun to fight those guys.
6650,I loved fighting them in WW and TP.
13230,"While Mipha's Power is very helpful, I would counter by saying the Rito Divine beast is the best beginner dungeon. The initial Pacification in order to board it is the easiest, the puzzles are a good intro into the Dungeon movement mechanic, the Boss is relatively simple and straight forward, and you'll walk out of the dungeon with a set of armor that allows for exploration of severe cold areas, an ability that makes exploration and tower activation trivial, and a bow that is excellent at taking down guardians if need be. "
13557,"No. Assuming you upgrade to have the set bonus, you are literally not affected at all by electricity. You can be struck by lightning and don't even flinch."
13633,"Because Armor never breaks, it is generally much more rare.

Most Major villages will have a shop that sells at least one set of armor.

Each armor set generally excels in a specific situation, so while costly, it is a good idea to purchase every armor set you can.

Also be aware that several armor sets can be found scattered around various shrines throughout the world.

ALWAYS explore shines thoroughly to make sure you get every chest. "
13732,That would do it. You can also get shot by shock arrows.
15412,"When I play through the game again on hard-mode, I'm going to do Rito first. The main issue I have with Mipha's Grace is that it does the exact same thing that Fairies do. Late-game, when you have 20+ hearts, fairies only heal for like 5 or 6, which is nothing. At that point, Mipha's Grace is really good. But since we are talking early game, it makes more sense to just stock up on Fairies next to Kakariko village and then go get an ability that is MUCH more useful than a glorified fairy on a cooldown.

Plus you also get the armor and weapon I mentioned previously as well.

IMO it just makes more sense to go Rito first, then Zora. From there it is up to the player as to what they want to do next. "
15559,"Even then, if they die alot, it's better to either A.) Stock up on Fairies near Kakariko, or B.) Abandon the Divine Beasts for the time being and go do some shrines to get their hearts up to around 10."
15614,Only on a certain mountain with a certain powerful monster.
27483,Yes. Otherwise you can buy them from some of the villages.
