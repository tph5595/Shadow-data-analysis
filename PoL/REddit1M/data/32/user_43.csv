10650,"I jumped in immediately. I remembered climbing up the sloped canyon for a while to get to the hideout, and thought that I had climbed enough elevation that now I must have been on some sort of cliff/overhang. I jumped into the hole thinking that I would emerge miles up and then be able to float my happy ass all the way back to Gerudo city. Forgot that I should have remembered that I had never seen any nearby mountain that would make that possible. Not sure how I got so confused geographically. 


But yeah, I jumped in really excited, waiting to get through the hole and come out from the bottom of a cliff overhang, expecting fresh air and sunlight and a spectacular view. Them I died. Pretty disappointing. "
