31494,"People worried about dying should farm for ironshrooms. You find a ton in the early main quest path. Tier 2 and tier 3 defense buff is extremely strong. What Kotetsuya says pretty much takes care of the rest, though Fairies really are optional given how generous the save points are."

At that point, I'd go for Gerudo first, because the power should still let you completely turn around fights that are too long or you just don't like. This is on top of maximizing the efficiency of weapon durability."
31992,"I actually had access to Golden Bow way before any significant stealth boost (Desert first lol), so I used it primarily for long shots against Korok challenges, sky high deep strikes, and to hunt game before they can detect me. Also useful for picking off enemies in the open desert before they can sound an alarm.

The description also says ""shoots farther."" I nearly died of laughter when I was like ""what the? How far does this thing... OOooooOOOooo."" Didn't even have to fire the thing to know what I was in for LMAO.

EDIT: I still keep at least 1 on hand for grabbing special horns, scales, and claws. Also, aiming should always be done pre-emptively with any bow. The screen will always center on the direction of the camera. You can abuse any bow even in CQC, assuming your camera settings are at max speed or Z targeting actually places the camera behind you."

It's tradition, fan service, but most importantly, a vital part of the game's narrative. The mystery shrouding the existence and acquisition of the sword adds a whole element to the story and NPC interaction that a mandatory Master Sword hadn't before: tension. There is a collective sigh of relief just reaching the thing. However, be cautious. This game doesn't want you to become comfortable with just one piece of the puzzle."

Unlike blakejp before me, I haven't had to be directly behind the Lynel. This is a really weird thing to read about for me. My best advice to you is to use Urbosa's Fury, which stuns far longer, and test the trigger range on mounting. If it's for sure just denying you your mount, then you need to buckle down and do it the old fashioned way: perfect parry -&gt; arrow to the face -&gt; rapid spin attacks (full circle on gamepad). Rinse and repeat. You could also flurry, but unless it's a heavy two-hander, that's really inefficient for durability."

The only guaranteed Royal Shield I can think of, even at the very beginning of the game, is in central Hyrule. Otherwise, later on, they show up everywhere."
