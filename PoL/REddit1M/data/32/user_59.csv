Also if your really in a bind you can sneak up on bokoblin camps they sometimes have there weapons in a pile or leaning against a log. Sneak as close as you can if you see this and make a mad dash to steal them if you have to. non combat shrines are a good bet as many have treasurers with weapons in it if your willing to do a little extra puzzle solving. Early game it can be a bit tough but this problem will turn in to i cant hold enough weapons over time.

2. you can only make a camp fire and can cook single things on it for increased healing. you can't make a full on cooking station."
