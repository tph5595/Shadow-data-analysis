670,"Because Lynels are the most Badass mob in the game. When you first meet one it wrecks you because you've fought nothing no where near as strong as them. Then as you get more experienced and you re-challenge them, you do better but it's still an uphill battle until finally you've learned their moveset so well you know how to perfectly dodge all their attacks, when and how to inflict the most damage and do stuff like smacking them while rodeo riding their back just to humiliate them and the Lynels become your bitch as long as you keep kicking their asses you feel like your on top of the world lol."
1570,Do the Amiibo Armors have any Set bonuses?
1834,"The game does a good enough job of this imo. The king who you have to talk to in order to leave the great plateau tells you to go east and find kakariko village. Impa in Kakariko gives you the quest for the divine beast which shows you where to go for those you just need to unlock the map for the regions they're in to see where you really need to go. Impa also sends you to hateno to get your sheikah slate upgraded which leads to the memory album, there's an npc in kakariko that will help you find the memories after you do a quest for him that requires camera function, just find him at the stables after that and he'll point you where to go. As for the master sword if you've seen any of the trailers it should be obvious where the sword is and an npc near the sword will help you acquire it."
