12193,"Got the game just on Sunday and have been playing NON-STOP as soon as I get home from work. 

1) That great strength shrine to get the climbing gear chest is fuckin HARD, do I suck or do I need better weapons? I got so close to winning but his spin attack glitched out and went straight through the pillar... Anything more I should be doing than a max attack boost and weapons in the 20s/30s (bows weaker)? Only have fire and electric arrows right now.

2) What do I do with dragon parts? I only have a Farosh claw right now.

3) I can't pick which beast to start with, I'm mostly just doing towers and shrines for now and making my house dope. Is the Zora one good to start with? I mostly play this to explore and find loot and avoid enemies more often than not so whatever can help me climb mountains and shit is what I want for now. (I've avoided spoilers so far on what the powers are and I want to stay that way.)"
17094,I have the other 2 climbing pieces though!

17852,Wait you can stasis those things?! Ok let's give this another go...
