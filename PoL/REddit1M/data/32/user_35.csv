7354,"I'm currently missing my last two Korok seeds:

One is between Lake Tower and Highland Stable, pretty much west of the Fural Plain on a small hill. I think it's either one of the flower puzzles or a race. I just can't find the starting point.

The second is in the fountain in central square south of Hyrule Castle. I can't figure out this one either.

Can anybody help me?"
9145,"Thank you, I found it! :D Only one to go."
9249,"Yeah, it was a race. The start is a bit too much west from where I searched, but I finally found it. Thanks!"
