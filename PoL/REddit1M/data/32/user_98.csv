Like straight up ejects out of the water and then cruises along the waterfall (Floria fall) in close proximity, giving you ample surface and time to nail one of his body parts. A shrine is right behind the main waterfall too, very very close. Just set up a campfire under one of the large palm trees close to the spring, wait until morning, see Farosh spawn right before you, do the dirty, rinse and repeat."
