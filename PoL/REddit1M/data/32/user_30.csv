I've read the dragon rises from Lake Hylia at 9pm, at midnight, and at sunrise. Not knowing which one was correct, I went to the bridge and waited there. I waited for an entire day and at NO time did I see the dragon. What's the deal?"
17337,"yeah that's the spot I was waiting at.

I never bothered to wait more than one day, so I will just use the fire and skip ahead as needed."

The weather can be tricky there and make it harder to see. I would jump straight down (paraglide in bursts to avoid losing health when you land) and look to the east.

Once you find it, mark it with a symbol on your map for future reference."
