6207,"What areas can I visit with all three pieces of Flamebreaker armor that I cannot with only two? Secondly, what areas can I visit that REQUIRE the set bonus from the Flamebreaker to access that I otherwise cannot? Finally, what areas can be accessed with the Flamebreaker armor with set bonus that cannot be accessed with elixirs? Thanks in advance."
