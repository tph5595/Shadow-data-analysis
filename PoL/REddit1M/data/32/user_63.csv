19648,Have you met Naydra yet?
21832,"If you've met Naydra and done what she asks you to do, and you still can't get Farosh to spawn near Lake Floria, would you mind letting me know?"
28783,Don't go full spoiler if you can't figure it out. I have a very minimalist hint if you need it.
29195,"Maybe you didn't see it, but there is a giant bird-shaped snowy surface (hence ""white bird""), not a wing-shaped rock formation, that you're looking for."
30013,"They decided that it makes more sense for him to be right handed since the sword action is done by the right hand on the joycon, basically. It sounds like we'll be moving toward right-handed Link in future 3D titles, if not all Zelda titles."
30148,"AFAIK, the only thing you get is a new menu/map function that tells you how much you have completed (% map completion, # shrine quests and side quests finished, things like that). We may get more as DLC down the line."
30951,"&gt;All I wanna know is : at this current stage of the game, can I solve this puzzle and continue? 

OP did not ask for a hint yet."
32285,Chuggzugg's hint is pretty close to what I was going to offer. Have you gotten the dungeon map yet?
32640,"If you walk slowly, perhaps crouching, you should be able to get near enough before startling them."
33062,"When you first entered the dungeon, Mipha should have shown you where the Map terminal (specifically a Guidance Stone, separate from the five control terminals) is. It may appear to be closed off by a gate, but you've dealt with barriers like that in the past."
33258,No problem! That should help with the rest of the dungeon. Good luck.
35004,Following through with Naydra gives you access to a shrine - did you get that far?
38890,"I believe the number they actually said was ""less than 2%,"" which it is easily the case. I think it's very slightly more than 1%."
41636,"Yes.

However, you can easily get a lot of amber and opal later in the game, so they are fine to sell if it means stocking up on arrows/armor or completing expensive side quests."
41763,"Just to gauge where you are without spoiling too much, have you talked to the Goron Bludo and helped him out yet? 

Edit: I suppose you must have to get across Eldin Bridge. Yunobo will help you with the cannon."
46004,How did you put the bridge down?
46621,It doesn't matter. Get it when you feel like you should for your story.
47342,"That's the only sort option. It sorts a particular way for each subgroup of items. Clothing gets sorted either in sets, or by gear type, switching between the two. Weapons get sorted by type (1h, spear, or 2h), materials get sorted something like food &gt; flowers &gt; bugs &gt; monster parts &gt; ores &gt; other materials. "
47581,You could think of it like that; though with all of the cut scenes and NPC hints it's pretty heavily implied that you *should* get it. It's just not attached to a quest or anything.
51024,Have you gotten the map from the guidance stone yet?
68533,"Yeah. I'm not sure you have the conditions right for the true ending, but you can go back and meet them later if you want to see both."
80088,Have you tried using the cannon in front of you in the same way?
80842,Just unequip them.
