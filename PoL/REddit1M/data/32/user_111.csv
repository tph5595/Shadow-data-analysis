46238,"I am curious about order of events- I was tipped off to the location of the Master Sword by an NPC, but I was wondering if it comes up as a quest in the main storyline.  I would prefer if classic plot progression played out the way it usually does (where somebody tells you to go get the Master Sword), so if that's the case I'd like to hold off until the right time.
  
If it's not plot related or it's just a sidequest/doesn't matter when you get it, let me know."

The amount of freedom is just so unusual for the series I'm having some trouble letting it play out organically, at least for the main storyline."
