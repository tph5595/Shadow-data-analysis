3427,Am i the only one who think that there are very few types of enemies? and no aerial enemies besides keeses and no water enemies besides octorocs(i hate that guy)
5587,"me too, with the advanced combat in this game it should be so fun. It has always been fun in past zelda games"
5659,"oh yeah wizzrobes, I like that enemies, but I was dissapointed that it does not have a level up system like the others, it only has 2 levels

edit: grammar, i am not a native english writer sorry"
5904,"I love the level colored system, but it is only applied to 4 kind of enemies(boko,moblins,lynels and no elemental lizalfos), to fight a silver Iron Clad/darknut/Iron knuckle woul have been amazing "
6031,or if they were breaking the zelda convention why not to add new kind of enemies besides the amazing guardians and Yiga warriors. but well the game is amazing even with this flaws it is my fav game so far
6188,"they only use one arrow to shot 3, it is win win. look at the arrow counter when you shoot"
7703,"yeah, It felt so good to put away theirs armor"
17622,"here you can check that is the zelda with less type of enemies, and don't count the color variation, it is only to differentiate the level of the opponent(a mechanic that I love)
http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/List_of_enemies

the game is almost perfect but you have to accept that there is a lacks of different kind of enemies at least for not humanoid enemies like spiders(skultulas), poes(imagine a ghostly axe wielded by link), armos, redead(well this is humanoid but does not use weapon), some water enemies(gyok or a mighty shark) or the anoying like like.

also you are mentioning some sub-bosses there"
