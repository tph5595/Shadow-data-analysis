15703,"Im like 1% into the game loving every aspect of it, just 2 questions. 

1. What happens if I just dont have any weapons left? Maybe this was just something early and ill eventually have a stock of them in my bag but I got to a point where I have no weapons and i just had to kite enemies with my bomb for awhile to get one. Is there a trick to finding them?

2. Can I make my own cooking fire? "
