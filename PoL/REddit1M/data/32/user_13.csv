2868,"How do you mount a Lynel?  I would think it'd be as easy as getting behind it, but the ""mount"" prompt never shows for me.  I sometimes Statis+ the Lynel, shoot it in the face with an arrow, and it kneels down, but whenever I run up to it, I never get the prompt.  I have only faced red/blue Lynels so far though.  Do I have to Z-target?  I don't know why I can't mount one.
