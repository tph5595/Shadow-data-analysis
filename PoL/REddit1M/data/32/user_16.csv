3790,"Have you gone to Kakariko? Impa gives you a few tips.

Basically theres 4 beasts, one per ""race"" (Zora, Goron, Gerudo, Rito). The most common 'first' one seems to be Zora since it's the closest to your starting area-ish.

Hope that was vague enough but still helpful lol"

14458,"at work, so I can't check now but how far is rupee bowling from hebra tower? Also, I have the doublet and 1 or 2 1level cold resist food. Is getting there reasonable without burning through my stash? (and does the timer tick during the actual bowling game?"

14692,"The scales are eventually used for gear but the first of each, you'd want for the 3 spring quests, really don't think it's worth cooking them

Also, don't worry about that piece yet... There's 2 other climbing pieces you can get to help in the meantime and they're way easier to get to"
