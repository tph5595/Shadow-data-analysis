10354,"Reduced electric damage.

If you want to not drop your items when you get shocked, there is an item that does that (as well as making you immune to lightning strikes)"
10658,"Come to think of it though, I believe the rubber set bonus also allows you to not drop your weapons, but you have to wear all 3 pieces, so the 1piece immunity is still super useful."
13177,"1) Electric arrows are *super* useful on those guys, it'll shock them out of just about any attack.

2) You can cook with them..they make longer lasting food, but don't do this until you dont need them for anything else, as you'll need scales to open certain shrines, and gear upgrades.

3) The only one I don't recommend you start with is Gerudo [because the intro quest begins the super frequent spawning of yiga assassins who will engage you at the worst time for the rest of the game](/spoiler). But even then, any of them is really fine and you're at no great advantage or disadvantage either way."
13753,"Sometimes from shrines, sometimes from vendors, sometimes from sidequests, sometimes just sitting in a chest out in the world.

There is a chest piece you can get before leaving the plateau, but it is not mandatory."
15412,"You can't get back in to take it yourself, but you can buy it from the workshop for rupees."
15696,"They definitely don't spawn every night.  What worked well for me was going to the parapet at the end of the bridge (that you get to from the tower) and waiting until 9pm, then waiting a minute or two.. no later than midnight, and if he wasn't up , wait until night again.

He'll be there eventually, you just have to make fires until he shows up."
15777,"It's very close, you could probably jump down to it without even needing to paraglide.  Use the doublet and a fire weapon, if you can, the timer does tick."
16479,"1) If you don't have any weapons at all, you can certainly bomb kite, but that can take some time. This only happens pretty early on, since the early weapons have terrible durability.  There's an iron hammer in the shrine where you learn the stasis rune which will respawn inside the shrine once it breaks, so if you have nothing, you can always grab that and use it to kill something to get another weapon.  Most of your weapons early on will come from enemies and their camps, and you can often do a ton of damage or even totally clear them out from afar without using any weapon at all.

2) throw a bundle of wood and a piece of flint on the ground and hit them with a metal weapon.  You can roast food on this fire, but it's not a cooking pot, so you won't unlock any buffs from the food you cook, it will only restore hearts."
17149,"Sure, there's a free great flameblade on top of the ancient tree stump, due west of the central tower. (I mean free as in out in the open, and will respawn when yours breaks.. it's still guarded by a couple moblins and bokoblins that you can knock off the bridge with a bomb.)  

And yeah, having it equipped is enough."
19706,"Plus a fireproof elixir for death mountain, but otherwise I believe so, yeah."
21281,"This is the workshop on the hilltop behind Hateno, the assistant there will sell you compendium entries once you've gone through the workshop's initial quests."
21853,"If you're still on the Plateau, there's a respawning hammer inside the shrine where you get the stasis rune."
22045,"It's nice to keep one around because they shoot straight, like an ancient bow. (That is, the arrow flies much further before it starts to drop) and you can always get another one in gerudo town.  "
25053,"I don't think you can see it from the tower, since theres a hill in the way IIRC.

However, it's also super easy to just run or ride north-northwest from the outskirts stable to get to the ancient stump if you dont have the central tower yet, and outskirt stable is right next to the great plateau. 

If you have the tower just glide west from it, the guardians are all stationary and not really a threat."
31199,"Yeah, I've seen them at night, in the snow fields around and between the Hebra stable and the Hebra tower.  They are probably elsewhere as well, but that's where I remember seeing them consistently."
31597,"Each piece of armor that is upgradeable can be uprgraded as many time as the number of great fairies that you have unlocked, to a maximum of 4, which is also the number of great fairies that there are.

There is no difference between the upgrades that the different fairies provide, every fairy does the same thing to your armor, for the same mats.  Each time you upgrade a piece of gear, it gains increased defense, and gains a star next to the name, so your fully upgraded gear will have 4 stars next to it.  You don't have to choose which pieces you upgrade at the cost of other pieces or anything... if you collect the mats to upgrade, you can upgrade every piece of eligible armor you own, there is no limit.

Upgrade your gear, you will not miss out on anything by doing so!  You will just take less damage."
31844,"OH, you mean keep it permanently? 

Sadly not.. You can't keep it... I thought you were asking if it was possible to ""board"" them like ""climb aboard"".. my mistake."
34682,Champion's Tunic is 32 @ level 4
42172,"There is certainly another use for them, but in the early game selling them for some easy rupees is totally worth it, however.. hang on to your diamonds.

They all become trivial to farm later in the game, when you're more likely to run into the uses for them in larger numbers."
42472,The monsters along the sides of the coliseum are a pretty safe bet.
66972,"Replying again because I tried it out and I was mistaken.  One piece was enough to let me live in Goron City, and Two pieces was enough to let me live through the northern mines.  With two pieces your buff is 2 out of 2 ""Flame Guard"" which stops you from burning on death mountain, and the third piece grants the set bonus ""Flame Proof"".  

There's likely some stuff you need the set bonus for, but death mountain can probably be completed with two pieces, or 1piece+Elixir. 

Worth mentioning that heat resist gear and ice weapons are useless on death mountain, you need flame guard."
