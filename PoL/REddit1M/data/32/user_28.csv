5761,"Is there any way to get regular and mighty lynel gear after all of the lynels in my game have become white/silver? I know about the red lynel by the zora, but he doesn't drop the regular lynel crusher or spear, which I'm missing. I know I can buy the pictures for them but I'd also like to be able to try them out."
6239,All of the ones in my overworld that were previously blue or red are now replaced by mostly white and at least one silver. Are there ones that don't change in hyrule castle?
