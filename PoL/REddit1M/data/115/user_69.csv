43488,"I've defeated Ganon, twice. But it will not change the final main quest to ""completed"".  Instead it says ""King Rhoam"" and ""Great Plateau"". Does anyone have any idea what I must have missed?"
44394,"Odd. I figured it would atleast show as completed in the Quest menu.
Thank you very much."
