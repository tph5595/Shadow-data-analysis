54658,"What points of interest are there inside Hyrule castle? 

I already got [the Hylian Shield and the shrine in the docks.](/spoiler)

I read about [the dark Master Sword and I will get that](/spoiler), but other than that, what things are worth exploring and finding in Hyrule castle? You don't need to give me precise directions, just key words. Can I explore [the sanctum or will this trigger Ganon? Where can I find Zeldas room I have read so much about?](/spoiler)"
