7883,"Not really a question. More of a tip-ish.

I found out that the Champion's Gifts recharge faster when in Hyrule Castle, so if you don't want to wait half an hour for Mipha's Grace or Daruk's Protection to recharge, just head to Hyrule Castle. Not sure if this also applies to being inside a Divine Beast, but since Hyrule Castle is the most accessable, it's the easiest to go to."
