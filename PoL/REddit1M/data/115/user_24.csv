11695,"Hey guys, so my girlfriend just recently got me the rider Link amiibo as a gift (bless her soul), and it's been nice to have a daily cache of various shrooms and a chest with some arrows. I'm wondering about the saddle and any other item specific to the amiibo though. Do they just drop at random? Specific day/place on the map? "
13278,Thank you! I was worried I forgot it from the first drop or something.
