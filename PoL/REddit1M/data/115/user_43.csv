you can savescum it though. If you reload your save after using it, you can use it again until you get the drop you want.

Then you can even change your console internal clock if you don't want to wait for tommorow (must quit the game completely though)"

also you''l need 22 of each if you ever wanna fully upgrade jeweries (47 for the opal earrings and 63 for the amber earrings). Buying price is between 3 and 10 depending of gem rarity. Keep in mind it also require star fragments

You'll need a whole lot of luminous stones to buy and upgrade the radiant set (46 per piece). you can also trade 10 of them for a diamond at the zora domain, but it's better to sell them as is.

There's a gerudo at the goron village that will buy a specific type of gems for about 10% more compared to standard shops (between topaz and diamond) by batches of 10 after you've finished the divine beast.

The rest you can sell. "

82601,This mostly applies for tier 4 upgrade (except jewelries and radiant set). By the time you'll get there (usually after you've beaten some divine beasts) you'll be rolling in gems from silver ennemies and rare lithorocks farming so don't worry.
