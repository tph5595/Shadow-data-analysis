12444,"So this may be a stupid question but I've been searching for ages and still haven't worked it out, I don't really play but my younger brother does and it's bothering us to no end so I thought I might as well just ask. 

On the tip screen (the black and white one not the loading screen) there are emblems top right, we know: health, stamina, korok, orbs, rupees. But we've got 16 of something and I have no clue what it is and My googling skills have actually failed me help!

Edit: thanks guys been bothering me for weeks! "
