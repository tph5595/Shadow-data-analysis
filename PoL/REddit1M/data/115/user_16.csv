7970,"I got to Zora's Domain last night. One of the coolest places I've yet seen, it's like a massive Elven city. Anyway, is it possible to climb up to the cliffs around Zora's Domain? I'm asking because it's rainy and stuff. I wanna get all the stuff around it before I move on to Akkala."

15127,"If I really wanted to, could I buy all 385 pictures in the Hyrule Compendium? I understand it's expensive but sometimes you'd just rather grind it out than search out 385 objects. I heard the bosses need to be photographed directly but what about everything else?"
16811,Thanks! So you can only buy all of them after the game is over? I guess that's alright with me; I've heard what you get for finding them all doesn't really help you in any way.
47120,That's all I ever asked for.
