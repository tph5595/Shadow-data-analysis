7130,"I got the Spring-Loaded Hammer from Kilton. 1-damage, but supposedly the highest durability of any single-handed weapon. In game it says that the hammer provides more knockback than other weapons, but in my experience using it (both on enemies and on stasis-frozen objects) it was not noticeably different.

Does this ""weapon"" actually do anything useful?"

21741,Do you know how much faster? 2x?
21818,What was the last thing you were missing? (just curious)
21947,"You'll know right away when they drop, because 2 chests will fall.

If you're saving/reloading over and over, that should speed things up, because you don't have to waste time opening chests if there's only one."
22053,"Silver enemies don't go for food. It's too bad, because one strategy is to lure them away one by one, distract with food, and stab in the back."
24741,That's right! I think I did the same thing. Not sure why that's part of the main quest though....
82811,Ah. Man I really regret not talking to more NPCs early on in my playthrough.
