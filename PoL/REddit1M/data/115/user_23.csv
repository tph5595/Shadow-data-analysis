10963,What happens when you complete a Divine Beast boss with 30 heart containers? Does it give you a stamina vessel instead?
11060,you can also shoot beams from the master sword when your health is full
11594,"no I mean what if you actually have 30 heart containers, where none of them are spare hearts?"
12400,"I'm about to do my final Divine Beast, so I may test this out. haha"
15834,"what if you chose not to pick it up, and complete the divine beast? Will it be lost forever, or does the game force you to pick it up to complete the dungeon?"
19123,"someone else pointed out that it gives you a heart container, but it won't let you pick it up. haha"
