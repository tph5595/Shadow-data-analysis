33860,"Is the master sword pull out gauge strictly for hearts? I heard you need a minimum of 13 but here i am with three full stamina wheels and only four hearts (got that fourth from finish zora's divine beast) I really dont want to rush my playthrough by spamming shrines or divine beasts i saved for later, but i also don't want to waste my nice weapons on ore farming. 
  
I'm thinking about going to the shrine and doing the exchange but i'm worried the master sword will call bullshit when i trade them back for stamina . . . 
  
Anyway around this? And if not, can i get some tips on where those ore sledge hammers spawn? "

[Even the developers said they thought it could get a little lonely in such an vast game, so they made him out to be like a little doggy companion.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VKSUiiD1XQc) 
 Plus the actual figure is the best looking and would look nice on a shelf. 
  
Honestly none of the amiboos have some kind of top tire drop or loot since most of the good stuff are just clothes that reference other games. And since the drops are all randomize and cap off at one use per day, don't expect an immediate payoff on them. Toon Zelda CAN give you one of the strongest shields in game, but *90%* of the time it's hylian herb or other msc plants.  If you dont already collect amiboos i would just pass. But know there not too expensive if you only buy your favorites over time, and i think their lots of fun as shelf eye candy. "

36187,"I agree that he's just jealous. Even Zelda hated Link at first because he's the ""chosen one by the scared sword"" while she can't even get the godess to fart in her direction. All the characters in this game all have depth if you give them a chance since it's very subtle. Even the villager NPC's have some touching stories. But unless you look into it, you wont see it. "
