76105,"Very early game spoilers:

Sounds like you're in Hateno Village. Remember to get here, you had to fly off the great plateau through two big mountains? The dueling peaks stable should be right around there."
77705,"For the castle: [there's a memory there. If you look at the mini map of the castle head on, to the left of the main middle bit you'll see a tower that's a bit separate from the rest. Get onto the walkway to that tower and the memory is there, and Zeldas room is nearby](/spoilers)

For your last bit: [stepping into the sanctum will trigger ganon. Basically if you see ""SANCTUM"" come up on the bottom left, leave immediately. If you get out as soon as the text shows up you should be able to leave without triggering the fight](/spoilers)"
