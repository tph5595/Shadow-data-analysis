12776,I got the Bokoblin mask last night and now I can't bring myself to kill them because they're cute when they're all friendly....I even gave them food! The silver one (in a group of red ones) wouldn't take food and follows me around- do they ever figure out that I'm a lie if I don't attack them? The silver one seems suspicious...
