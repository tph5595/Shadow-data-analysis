10120,"You'd need to make a Fireproof elixer to actually get to the city (this is different than heat-resistance). Once there you can buy the fireproof armor. As soon as you arrive there should be an NPC Goron that will take you right to the armor shop. Pants and Armor are $600 each I believe, and the helmet is $2000, but I think you can get the helmet for free from a Goron City sidequest."
