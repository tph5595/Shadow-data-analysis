28464,"So first of all...dafuq was that flying dragon in the sky? 

Second of all, I'm at the point where I need to revisit locations from Zelda's picture album. Any tips with this? I've been trying my damndest to find the location from the second picture. I know I'm on the correct side of the mountains but I can't seem to pinpoint the actual location. Won't the location look different after 100 years? What do I do when I think I'm at the correct spot?"
