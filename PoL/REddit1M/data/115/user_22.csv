10787,"TIL that you can cut grass much easier with a weapon that shoots a beam, like the Yiga sword.

I discovered this while I was cutting grass looking for hightail lizards to upgrade my climbing gear, then a Yiga clan member attacks me, so I kill him and take his weapon and the wind it shoots makes farming the lizards way easier because you cut like 4x the amount of grass with one swing.

However the sword didn't last too long before it broke from cutting grass... still it helped me farm much quicker."
