3392,"Is the game supposed to remove certain elements from saves?

Some context [Possible Minor Spoilers]: 
This morning, I see an aurora over a mountain, and go to check it out, and find a bunch of blupees and a rare mount. I quicksaved before I did anything, tried to mount the beast, didn't replenish stamina in time, failed, and it ran off. I reloaded my quicksave to try again, but the entire area was cleared out and the aurora was gone. This has happened with dragon encounters too. What gives? Is this a bug, or did Nintendo intentionally remove aspects from saves to make the game more challenging?"
