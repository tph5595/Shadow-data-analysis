23664,Guardian is the best.  
25251,"I have all 15.  The ones that give classic clothing like wind waker ones are cool, but don't help your day to day game.  As I said, Guardian gives the most valuable stuff every day.   8-bit is really cool because it drops good items and rupees each day.  Then some others like archer link can drop bomb arrows which help against tough bosses.  Bokoblin drops some good meat.  "
