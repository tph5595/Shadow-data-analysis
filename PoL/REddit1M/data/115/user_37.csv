14327,"Hi, I've a question about the ending scene. I've finish all the main quest including the final memories before fighting Ganon and free the 4 you-know-what, but when I kill Ganon I didnt get the scene where Link and Zelda standing infront of the castle's gate, walk away and the spirit of the king and 4 champion standing on top of the castle then disappear like when I saw on youtube, what did I miss?"
16030,"I did, and she gave 1 more memory location right? and I finished that too"
17878,"Yes, everything in the main quest log is done, and yes, like I said I already check the last memory, the one about Link's death-ish right

Oh, but now that I check the main quest number again I only completed 13/15, let aside Ganon one there's still one more... I wonder what is that
"
20099,"oh nvm, i got it"
22539,"The great fairy main quest, i did unlock all of them but i didnt take that quest yet"
31289,Or you mean the sword memory? Where zelda put it back? I found that way earlier due to gettting master sword before the 2nd guardian so i dont think of it as the last. I did get all 1i memories anyway
