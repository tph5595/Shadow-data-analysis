22140,"Okay, so, I swear at some point I found someone who REALLY wanted roasted salmon, though it didn't give me a quest, and I have a roasted salmon and wanted to try giving it to the person. BUT I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY ARE. I probably found this person like 60+ hours ago, and at this point, I think I have just been carrying this roasted salmon around for no reason and I hallucinated the whole thing. 

Anyone know what I'm talking about??? Did I make this up? I haven't been able to successfully google it, and it's been driving me crazy. If it's a quest, I don't want spoilers other than where the hell I need to go."
22715,"Thank you!! I definitely did it before Vah Medoh, so that's probably why I don't have the quest. "
