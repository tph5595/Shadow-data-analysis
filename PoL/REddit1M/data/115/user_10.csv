4705,"It's not that the game is intentionally removing things; the save system just doesn't record every single detail about the state of the world at that exact moment. There are some ""random spawn"" things like the Lord of the Mountain (glowing horse) and the dragons that won't persist through a save and reload. 

There are a few other things like this too. If you reload a save you may see enemies change position, horses change color, etc."
4929,"Not in-game, though that would be nice. There is a [separate map available](https://imgur.com/m0zacxO) that has that info, though.

Word of warning: I used this to finish up my shrine search, and there are a few shrines on region borders that can make things tricky. If you think you're missing a shrine in a certain area and just can't find it, check the neighboring areas too in case you counted a border shrine in a different area than this map did."

15818,"You should be able to buy them all. Even boss photos can be purchased (which is good, because otherwise they'd be missable) though you have to beat the game first."
16944,"There's not a way to make it rain on demand; the weather follows patterns that you can see in the indicator next to the minimap.

There are certain locations where it is always raining/storming, though, at least until certain quests are completed. Zora's Domain and Thundra Plateau are two of these. There's also a shrine in the south near Lurelin Village that's surrounded by a perpetual thunderstorm until you complete it."
23678,"In terms of usefulness, the best two are probably Smash Bros. Link and Twilight Princess Wolf Link. 

Smash Bros Link gives you Epona, a very well-statted horse (though not the best you can get). Wolf Link summons the wolf as a companion to aid you in battle, though if you don't have Twilight Princess HD to level it up, it will only have 3 hearts by default. 

Honorable mentions go to Toon Zelda, who can drop one of the strongest shields in the game, and Smash Bros. Zelda, who can drop a nice bow that doesn't have arrow arc. You can obtain equivalent-or-better items through normal gameplay, but these amiibos are a good way to get them early on. 

Most of the other amiibo just give you cosmetic stuff (like Link's outfits from the other games) or items that aren't amiibo-exclusive."
23758,There's no indicator. Just have to look for items in the environment that you can interact with.
23802,The terminals appear as dots on your in-game map. Which one do you have left?
