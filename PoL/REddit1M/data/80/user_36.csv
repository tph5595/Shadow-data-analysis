52447,"I don't think anyone ever said the game or any game is perfect, but this just represent the fact that overall it deliver on wht it supposed to do which is gives you a pure sense of adventure exploration and wander.

Then if you didn't like those point that's ok, i think the first 60-80 hours for me were 10/10. Wasn't bored and it was fun, i liked the dungeon because they were different and their geometry was ""alive"". In retrospective i think they should expand on this and do it on a more gigantic scale.

Skipping hyrule castle is for me a good idea, meaning, you play around all you want depending on the tools available in your disposition, if the future of dungeon in zelda can take this idea and bring it to the next level, count me in."
