101098,"Some of your complaints can be said about other games in the series.  Demise from SS is just an evil entity that's evil with no real explanation. Same could be said for Majora from MM, skull kid got backstory but Majora is just a powerful evil sealed in a mask. 

The relationship between BOTW Link and the other champions is painted in broad strokes, but the same could be said for his relationship with most of the sages in OOT. What do you even know about Raaru? How strong is the relationship between Link and Impa or Nabooru? Even with a sage like Saria, we see her say hi to Link when the game starts, give him an ocarina when he leaves the forest, teach him her song, and become a sage. That's about it. 

How is Link's backstory better in OOT? He's a hylian raised by kokiri and he was picked on because he didn't have a fairy. The only kokiri that didn't pick on him was Saria. Compare that to Link being raised in a family of the royal guard, training to be a soldier like his father, earning the master sword, being selected to guard Zelda, complicated relationships with the other champions, earning Zelda's trust, preparing for a coming apocalyptic battle, losing said battle, and being placed in stasis to survive? 

I think a lot of people are in this thread are being a bit unfair to BOTW. If you're going to be this nit-picky about BOTW then you should be just as critical about the other games in the series. "
104153,"Zelda tells you of Links family and you see him training in a flashback. You also see the aftermath of Link fighting a veritable army and Zelda starting to warm up to Link. Go back and watch the memories again.

You mean to tell me you didn't pick up on Revali being envious of Link's position as the hero, Mipha having feelings for Link, Urbosa having a big-sister like relationship with Zelda, or Daruk trying to bring the team together? 

Compare that to Raaru or Nabooru from OOT or any of the resistance members except Rusl in TP. What real back story do we get about the dead deku, goron, or zora that link has masks of in MM? Those are the closest things to secondary characters the game has and all we know is the goron is a hero and the zora is a musician, the deku is never mentioned.

I'm not knocking the rest of the series, it's been my favorite game series since I was a kid. But so much of the story from the other games has been only skin deep, so I don't get why they would get a pass on this but BOTW doesn't."
