3809,"I understand your points but I think most people went into BOTW to expect a departure from the traditional Zelda title. There is plenty of great music in the game, I mean sure it's not as exciting as the overworld theme from past games but that's because the focus is on the atmosphere; the sparse piano melodies when staring at hyrule from a vantage point can be gorgeous at times. The story segments had more of the traditional exciting music the series is known for.

I wouldn't say that the characters are bland, I just think we should've seen more of them throughout. Sidon, Daruk, Revali, Urbosa are all great in my opinion and I'm hoping the upcoming DLC shows more of them for my sake.

I agree with the lack of enemy variety in this game, given the large catalogue of enemies in the series I'm a bit confused that Nintendo didn't include a lot of what was missing. However, my experience with the current enemy roster is yet to come boring. The main enemies on this game are far more complex than they have ever been, the fact that they can change their weapon and force the player to approach the situation differently is fantastic.

I personally think we could have replaced about 28 of these shrines with fleshed out dungeons given that some of them are incredibly simplistic and don't take long at all to solve. In my experience, some shrines were fantastic whereas some were just as simple as using stasis on a moving orb...

I think some of your praise towards past Zelda games are somewhat sentimental, after returning to WW a few days ago I can find far more flaws in that game than BOTW.

I would say that this game has earned at 10/10 from a game design from perspective as it has raised the bar for open world gaming and still manages to maintain the key Zelda feel for many players. I would no way say that BOTW is perfect, there is a lot to complain about in this game because... well it's a game, even masterpieces like The Witcher 3 and The Last of Us have earned their 10/10 ratings across the board but there are still flaws present in both games.

In a lot of ways it sounds like this game was just not to your taste which is totally fine. I too have grown fond of the classic Zelda tropes but it was time for a change in formula. I'm sure Nintendo will take heed of your feedback and try and create a Zelda title which pleases to fans who want to experience classic Zelda theme while still having this brilliant open world adventure.

6274,"Yeah the whole Shiekah Tech aspect could have been toned down for the bosses, I mean from a story perspective it makes complete sense but it doesn't feel as exciting as discovering a new boss when compared to past games. The final form of Ganon was rather lazy I do admit, I mean the atmosphere is phenomenal but after figuring out how to kill him it was just... easy. It would be cool if you could climb on him and work your way up to add a bit of a challenge. I can get what you mean about OOT ganon, it was a great combination of atmosphere and difficulty into a boss battle; you lose the master sword temporarily and makes Ganon seem even more intimidating, I didn't get much of that from BOTW Ganon after figuring out how to defeat him.

I 100% agree with your concept for how dungeons should have been implemented in BOTW. I'd often find the tiniest of things in the overworld and would just imagine the possibilities of dungeon to explore. I kept seeing wells lying around and I got the urge to go underneath and explore some super-creepy hidden part of the game like on OOT. I'd be near the ruins of the Arbiter's Grounds and couldn't help but a desperate need to explore inside.

I'm glad they kept the aesthetics of the shrines consistent, for me it reminded me of the Tower of the Gods from WW. Some of my fondest memories with BOTW so far have been built from certain shrines... however some of them are rather unforgettable. 

I also think that Nintendo maybe took too much out of BOTW, I mean I miss entering combat with a hookshot, boomerang alongside my sword... kinda wish they'd make an appearance in the form of a Run in the Shiekah Slate. Knowing Nintendo, they will most likely succeed in creating a sequel which adds these key ingredients to the Zelda formula. I mean BOTW was created after fans criticised the strict linearity of SS."
9263,"I think I experienced what you're talking about at about 220+ hours into my first playthrough. After upgrading all of the useful armour and completing all the shrines, the korok puzzles were pretty much all I tried to do... which was rather dull, just lost interest in that part of the game. I don't think I'm going to bother with all of the sidequests, they might as well have been labelled as ""fetchquests"" in the menu. Like you I didn't think another playthrough would be as exciting as before but I was wrong. After completing the Great Plateau again my mind was once again racing with what I should do first. It feels great to explore uncharted territories again after walking around an almost completed account just killing lynels. I still set myself an objective and end up getting sidetracked my dozens of sideactivites in the overworld. I'll admit not all the shrines are great to return to (motion controls in particular...) but the essence of what made the game so great in the first place is still there."
10267,"One thing that has changed for my 2nd playthrough is the Divine Beasts, I really put them off for my first playthrough as I just wanted to explore and the thought of being confined to one area for several hours detracted from the open air concept. However, I really appreciate them now, I adore the fact that they fit in perfectly with the overworld, I love being able to see the skyline as I'm exploring them, a typical Zelda dungeon would just cut me off for hours. 

It is definitely a game which requires several breaks from time to time, every time I feel somewhat over the hype of BOTW I always end up returning and falling in love all over again. I mean around the 300+ hours mark I'd end up discovering a secluded area in the desert that had it's own unique music and it honestly gives me chills.

I personally see this game as a masterpiece but I can totally see why others can't. I think the best word to describe this game is a triumph, for this Zelda to completely redo the formula from scratch and end up raising the bar for open world gaming is fantastic. What excites me most about BOTW is how Nintendo can create an even better sequel once they take feedback for enemy variety, lackluster sidequests, story, dungeons, and discovery on board. Is BOTW the best game ever? I wouldn't say so but it may well lead to it.

I mean CDPR built upon the concept for The Witcher for 2 sequels before it was praised as a masterpiece, this is the first true open world Zelda and it is already hailed as such... I can only imagine how Nintendo will improve through sequels."
11870,"Yeah that's perfectly cool, I guess it might not just lead to an even better Zelda game but games of other franchises. I think that's why this game is hailed as such a masterpiece, the fact that so many other game developers can learn from it and shape a new future of gaming. I know the next Zelda will not be a perfect game but if Nintendo can appeal to the majority of criticisms, we're likely dealing with another masterpiece. If Nintendo just do a straight copy &amp; paste of BOTW with some dungeons and some compelling side-quests then thats not enough. If they can develop the open-air concept even further and add more varied discoveries (Shrines, dragons, fairies, labyrinths etc.)  then that is a sequel worth waiting for."
13325,"Yeah I can see that working, Maybe even something similar to a Divine Beast to represent different regions. Imagine if the map had consisted of several more islands similar to wind waker and there was something like a whale rising out of the ocean? Oh and another thing, it would be great to dive underwater again, leaving us even more to discover."
13773,"Believe it or not I used to think the snow mansion was the worst zelda dungeon at one point, now I think its awesome for being so unique in that aspect. I'd even appreciate a sidequest where you get caught in a blizzard and end up having to work with an NPC. Just something to make the NPC interactions more immersion rather than ""Oh I'll save this guy so I can get an elixir"". Honestly I really do enjoy just coming up with my own ideas for future instalments."
46799,"As someone who is a huge fan of WW, I hope the next installment adds the great sea with several islands alongside the land of hyrule. If the main land could have more villages unrelated to the story like Lurelin, it be good to have a part of the map which is just cut off from the rest. I always loved just staring at the sea from an island, hope I can do it again on the sequel."
48674,"Yeah I see what you mean, I get the urge to replay the past zeldas because I like the journey, I must have played through WW and TP dozens of times because of the dungeons and the story. So far I've put into 300+ hours in BOTW and I'm only halfway into my second account. I think it's harder to enjoy games when I'm older because I've adopted this analytical mindset, I played WW when I was 6 and thought it was incredible just because I was having so much fun... now that I'm older I can easily point out dozens of flaws. I'm sure if I played BOTW as a child I would feel the same way."
57452,"I think thats why I liked Lurelin so much, it was just so cut off from the rest of the game. There wasn't a divine beast causing trouble, the citizens seemed happy unlike other villages. That's the beauty of WW to me, showing up to an isolated island knowing that there is some secret there waiting to be discovered; I'd like more of that for a future  Zelda. Another moment in WW which I love is seeing the ghost ship for the first time, imagine seeing that sailing along the sea in the next zelda sequel? I can only hope."
62650,"Yeah I can agree with that, it'd be great to have some villages unrelated to key plot but can still have conflict. Yeah I'm a bit puzzled by that decision too, perhaps he just didn't want to take too much influence directly from skyrim. I don't think discovery is necessarily the key aspect to BOTW, I think the game is about creating unique player experiences. One of my favourite moments in any game ever is my journey in the Hebra mountains. I didn't have enough cold resistant clothes to protect me so I relied on the flameblade. I was deep in uncharted territory desperate to find the tower, I truly felt lost like I wasn't supposed to be there. I ended up losing my flameblade in a battle and I was slowly losing health. I was quickly trying to find the tower quickly before I died and I came across a campfire and used that as a resting spot. That was my own unique experience and it's a feeling I haven't got from a game before. I think that's where BOTW thrives, there are so many of them moments even now throughout my 2nd playthrough."
64434,"Yeah I completely agree, while I do have many stories I'm learning more and more about the game so I'd like to have more varied content in future. The experiences are all fantastic but I'd like something that stands out. I've also got a memorable story about how I survived through the heat of the desert with no weapons and bumped into the kara kara bazaar, but that story is rather similar to one where I was in hebra mountains... if I could have stories about how I'd discover a secret dungeon or hidden villages alongside that then it'd be amazing."
