61906,You’re forgetting that literaly nothing is rewarding in this game. I still remember climbing that icy mountain and fighting the dragon for the first time... for a Ice lance that break after a few use.
62264,"I disagree. The soundtrack might be great but there is just not enough variation and they all kinda feel the same in the end. Although I can’t say it is not consistant... I would have prefered a middle ground. You’re right about the castle, this is the only place that made me get up of my chair and say “oh my god, the music!”"

The game was properly tested, that I’m sure and I don’t see your point here."
63193,"Thats pretty much exactly what I wrote in another post lol. I agree with you. The game is one of the best open world I’ve seen but one of the worse Pure Zelda as well. I always said that BOTW was a good base to build a real story and bring back linear elements.

Add this to BOTW:
- 12 Dungeons with puzzles, unique monsters, mini-boss, boss and 1 unique item
- an alive castle town.
- Epic music at times with sometime classics of Zelda
- close off zone unless you have the right skill or item. This can still stay open world while not being able to get to certain place.
- a real fleshed out story
- do not allow game to be beaten before everything is completed hence bringing back the sense of accomplishement

Botw has been a really good game to me, but lack a lot imo to be remember as a Zelda game."
