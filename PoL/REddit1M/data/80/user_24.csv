23679,"Honestly, I think your problem was you went in looking for something specific and familiar and felt that when BoTW failed to deliver it, it wasn't good. I personally went into the game with no expectations, other than to have fun, and oh boy did it deliver. 150 hours later it's probably my favorite game ever. All your criticisms are valid, it's just that those were never things BoTW was ever going to be. I think if you maybe replay it, without the expectations of what was previously expected in a Zelda game, then you'll have much better memories of it. Think of it as a game in it's own right, rather than ""this is a Zelda game and zelda games need to have X, Y, and Z."" I hope as well that the next game has huge amazing temples, as nothing beats that feeling of entering the center chamber and having a huge feeling of awe pass over you because of the scope of the dungeon. I wish BoTW had 4 or 5 more Hyrule Castles, as that was an awesome big dungeon, that still fit BoTWs theme. You really have to want to explore in BoTW, and although you can speed through, take shortcuts, and avoid enemy encounters, don't. Not because you'll get something from fighting a few Bokoblins, but because you'll have fun doing it."
