10600,"BOTW is a 7/10 game. It does a lot right and a lot wrong. The thing it did best was exploring, it's easily the best game when it comes to that. Personally I miss dungeons. When we were first introduced to Shrines I was super excited about them but after doing 25 of them I realized how bad they were. They are all way to easy/simple and don't scale with the game whatsoever. Not to mention a handful are repeats. The best Shrines in the game really weren't Shrines at all, the Shrine quests. "
