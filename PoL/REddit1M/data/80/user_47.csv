153504,"I think what it is is that you were looking for something different.  Breath of the Wild is designed to reproduce the same sort of feelings as you would have gotten with the original Legend of Zelda for NES.

The series has been evolving over time.  A Link to the Past and Link's Awakening introduce this idea of dungeons being a mini-metroidvania, something not in the original.  Ocarina of Time and Link's Awakening introduced the concept of the macro-puzzle dungeon, something that was largely diminished in Wind Waker and Twilight Princess (but restored in Skyward Sword) in favor of more spectacle.

And Breath of the Wild threw it all away in favor of the original NES Zelda experience -- slap you into the world with nothing and let you go explore."
