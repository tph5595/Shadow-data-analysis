40615,"I've said it before, I'll say it again. Can people please stop sh*tting on the music of Botw please? It's not bad or unmemorable, it is different. If you had massive grand scores of adventure music everywhere you go, you'll get so sick and bored and it just wouldn't work. The game is about taking things at your own pace and the music reflects that. If the game had had a grans soundtrack, a similar amount of people would complain about interruption and it not fitting the game's style. Also the style is completely different to the last games, but it is still very strong, just not as recognisable. The only piece that is semi similar to the previous games is Hyrule Castle, which is why it is so popular. Tracks like Hateno Village, Horse Riding (Night) and Tarrey Town are vastly underrated. You can complain about the story and characters all you like (These were fine imo) but don't get angry at the music because it is the most innovative thing about the game."
