Shrines always provide a decent reward as health is excessively useful in this Zelda, but after a while they just get bland. It'd be nice if every region of the map had a different shrine design, and I'd be more willing to do every one than stopping doing them as soon as I got thirteen hearts and two stamina wheels. The Law of Diminishing returns hits the game towards the latter bits. Hard. "

11893,"Nah, it was an analogy. In my opinion, I'm really not a fan of Skyrim- I feel the dungeons eventually seem to lack variety and the combat is rather simplistic. However, it has a great sense of being on an adventure. Every cave is different and has something in it to find. Whether it be a bandit camp with a small sect planning a coup, a Dwarven ruin overrun with Falmer killing everyone trying to research it, and yes- even the notorious Draugr ruins often had journals and books detailing what once went on in the area. It just felt so alive and *real*, something Breath of the Wild abandons by using the shrine system instead of adding a few real mini dungeons. "
13148,"That's actually a rather deep way to look at them, and I never thought about it like that. Maybe it's just the spit in the face that are Korok Seeds that made me dislike them. If they just gave tiny, insignificant rewards like ARROWS or mid-tier equipment or things like that, I'd probably really enjoy them, provided there was more to do in the world. "
13255,"Oblivion is one of my favorite games of all time dude! While I try incredibly hard to get into Morrowind, I need to get my modding down to make it more modern. I've put twenty hours in, but damn if it isn't an obnoxious game with a lot of archaic systems. 

Still though, the Oblivion Dark Brotherhood is something I hold as what a quest line in an RPG should always strive to be. Especially that one mission where you're locked in the mansion and have to kill everyone without making your presence as the murderer known. 
"
13639,"That's actually all rather accurate. Morrowind feels the most like an outsider in a daunting new world, but depending on how old you are and how much experience you have with the RPGs of decades past, I wouldn't recommend it unmodded. I love old CRPGs, for example, and Fallout 2 *is* my favorite game of all time, but even then I have trouble getting into Morrowind.

Oblivion is the one I'd have to recommend the most. Though I would recommend a mod that changes the levelling system even though you're disinterested in mods, it makes the game a lot more focused on exploration and questing than minmaxing stat gains to stand a chance in the later game. It's generic, yes, and ruined the pre-established lore of the country it's based in (it was supposed to be an Asian-Roman fusion, IIRC), but the quests are so good.

But the faces. And the voices. Eurgh. I think Patrick Stewart was the entire voice acting budget.

Skyrim is repetitive, but if you're into mainstream games, I think you'd love it. Doubly so if you enjoyed BOTW. Is it repetitive? Hell yes. Does it reward exploration and focusing on your environment? Also yes. The quests are usually focused around combat than other interesting mechanics, unlike Oblivion, but it's still a great game with an interesting world. 

Take these for what you will, these are only my opinions. I like all three games, but in my eyes, *nothing* will beat out Oblivion. "
14115,"&gt; The world being empty is huge part of the story, calamity Gannon destroyed almost everything, that's like literally the whole point. 

I have to disagree here. The Fallout games have proven that, regardless of an apocalyptic event, it's possible to make a game world not feel empty. This goes doubly so for Fallout 2 and Fallout: New Vegas. The game worlds are so sprawling and yes, much of it is wasteland- however, the NPCs and settlements and small little buildings along the way do a lot to breathe life into the world, and make it feel a bit less lonely- something BOTW lacks. "
14605,"Fair enough, yeah, but it's important to note FO3 and FO4 had a different developer from New Vegas. I feel like for Nintendo, this is going to be their test at the format. This is a bit of a common hipster opinion, but I prefer Majora's Mask to Ocarina of Time because it built on OoT's formula and made improvements, and I hope BOTW gets a sequel or the next open world Zelda game takes what they learned from BOTW and improves. I just hope all the 10/10s and the high sales didn't distract them from some of the flaws the game had. Not to say it's not good, but it *can* be improved, and I'm excited to see what they do. "
15660,"Alright, I'm going to recommend a few here. They're all rather easy to install, but there's going to be a few steps.

First, install [Nexus Mod Manager](http://www.nexusmods.com/skyrim/mods/modmanager/?). This will make the entire process ten times easier. 

Then, you'll need to grab [OBSE.](http://obse.silverlock.org/) Download it, and put it in the root of your Oblivion install. Launch the game through obse_loader whenever you play! 

Next, I'd recommend getting [the Unofficial Oblivion Patch](http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/5296/?) and the [Unofficial Shivering Isles Patch](http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/10739/?) When you download them, click download through manager. The mod manager will handle most of it, all you have to do when they finish downloading is click Activate Mod in the Mods panel. 

While the Unofficial Patches are by far the most important, [Realistic Leveling](http://www.nexusmods.com/oblivion/mods/13879/?) is the most important from an end-user experience standpoint. It makes the game much easier to handle and has a lot less minmaxing- something even people who love Oblivion dislike at times. Same as before, activate mod. 

Now, you're gonna wanna go back to the plugins tab and make sure they're all checked. That should make you good to go!

If you can figure out how to install them, as writing a tutorial for these few would take far too long, Oblivion Character Overhaul and Darnified UI are also a few good ones, but again, you'll have to find out how to install them for yourself. Tutorials do exist though! 

And with those few, you should be good to start the game. This is the easiest method of modding the game, and there's no fancy load-order optimizing or anything involved, just activating mods. Everything is non-intrusive, and if you would like to play it unmodded to get the vanilla experience before doing anything, I'd still recommend the unofficial oblivion patches regardless. I hope you love the game!

Also, just a tip, don't play as a Lawful Good character at the start. The Dark Brotherhood, a faction of assassins, is lauded as one of the best questlines ever in an RPG, so going a bit chaotic will help a bit. "
