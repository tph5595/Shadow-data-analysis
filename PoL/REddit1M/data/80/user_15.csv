13311,"I agree, to an extent. It's a pretty amazing game in my book, but it lacks so much ""Zelda-ness."" And I know that was intentional on Nintendo's part, but yeah. I can't help but wish that there were more bosses like Kohga, where I actually needed a strategy other than ""hit it until it dies.""

Some Shrine variety, too. Even if some of them were just overgrown with vines for that ""Forest Temple"" sort of look, like maybe they weren't *completely* sealed. Sort of like how the Shrine of Resurrection is full of rocks and rainwater.

And OH MAN, the music. The lack of memorable music absolutely kills me.

I would've loved to see ONE familiar Zelda convention come back. A Hookshot rune, for instance. Would've made mountain-climbing so much more enjoyable if there was the occasional Peahat for me to latch onto. Some Iron Boots to explore the bottom of lakes... hell, even if the Yiga Blademasters were more like Darknuts, and I had to cut away their armour before I could land a hit.

*Something* like that.

One thing I suggested in another thread, is that we needed a Ghirahim-like antagonist. Someone who shows up from time to time to give defeating Ganon a bit of urgency. Because right now it seems like all the damage has been done, and we're saving Hyrule from... well, nothing. Everybody's gotten on with their lives. They don't need a Princess anymore. Imagine if the Gorons were being forced to excavate Vah Rudania, and *that* what was what was causing Death Mountain to erupt. Not it just... walking around. Or if the Zora had something to worry about that wasn't just ""slightly more rain than usual for a rainy region"". Why do the Zora even care about that? It *always rains in Zora's Domain!*

It's a great game, and I love it, but it does have a lot of faults. Hopefully some of it will be improved upon in The Champions' Ballad."
