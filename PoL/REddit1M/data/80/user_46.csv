113300,"I think the biggest ""pro"" is that BotW has literally changed gaming. You can climb every surface. The entire world is open with no loading screens and no invisible walls. It's next-level exploration and freedom that has literally never been done before. It's not a great Zelda game; it's a game that will shape an entire genre and probably all games in the future. That's why it's a 10/10, because it's revolutionary as fuck. "

345013,"You're angry for the fuck of it, apparently. Yes, the game is absolutely revolutionary for its climbing and exploration. There are no invisible walls **anywhere** except the edge of the map. You may not be impressed and that's fine, to each their own. But you can't say it's not revolutionary for games, because it absolutely is. Denying that is just refusing to see through truth or have knowledge of gaming history. "
346119,I'm 33 and have been playing open world games for a long time. I played thousands of hours of World of Warcraft. I've played a lot of open world games. No invisible walls and climbing all surfaces is revolutionary because it's not been done before. That's the fucking definition of revolutionary. Stop making bullshit arguments. You're just wrong. Accept it and move on.
