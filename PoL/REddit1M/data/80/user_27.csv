34332,"I completely understand your opinion, BoTW takes a big revolution for the Zelda series since OoT, if you are looking for those traditional Zelda experience in BoTW, you will get some disappointment.
For me, I have played through OoT, MM, WW, TP, SS, ALBW before, most 3D titles after OoT, they are all good games, but kinda feels like another OoT done in a different way.
BoTW made so many changes, and I love most of them, to me, this is the best of all.
