22536,"So, I did the same thing as you, but after doing the Zora and Rito beasts I just... stopped playing. I keep thinking ""I could go do ___"" but it feels more like a chore than anything.

I guess I'm strange in that I find the combat in BotW to be super boring (except Lynels). ""Headshot some dudes, explode stuff if it's there, whack dudes entirely too many times because enemy health/weapon damage balance is totally screwed."" I found that I was running everywhere in Majora's mask because it wasn't worth bothering, and really, at that point, what's the point of playing at all?

Don't get me wrong, I was so into the first playthrough that my wife (jokingly, I think) called herself a ""zelda widow"" at one point, but it's not like OoT or TP where I could see myself playing through it over and over. I guess we'll see if I get an itch in a few weeks or months, but right now I'm more curious about the older games I was too young for (OoT was my first)."
