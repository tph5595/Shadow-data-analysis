0,"Let me start off by saying I grew up with Zelda. A little kid playing the NES Zelda and A link to the Past. I love Zelda and have played all the games.

I know I'm being generic in saying I feel OoT was the best. But never by a huge margin. Alttp, WW, NES Zelda, and MM are all great and love them all almost as much. The other games I love too, regardless of their minor faults.

And I'm sure I'm not the first to find BOTW underwhelming. And this is not a hate post, because I enjoyed the game as it is. But as a Zelda game and the standards I've come to expect from a Zelda title, it was a let down. Not as boring as Skyward Sword, but still. 

For people to say it's perfect and many ratings giving it a perfect 10/10 or 5/5 is a bit much. I felt the lack of memorable music, the similar boss fights, the fact that all the dungeons look the same and all the mini dungeons look the same, and have the same music and enemies, seems that it was lazily put together. The characters are bland other than Sidon. Did I mention the music? 

I miss galloping through Hyrule field with amazing music, or sailing through the ocean with the wind at my back and adventure on the horizon. BOTW was the biggest overworld and yet felt so empty. So devoid of life. Oh great I discovered another mini dungeon with the same music and puzzles a 6 year old can solve. The same enemies and the same music.

Something about the older Zelda games that brings back fond amazing memories. Even the little interactions with Sheik in OOT were just amazing, or the funny moments in WW. Discovering things in the Zelda NES were satisfying. 

Nothing felt satisfying in BOTW. Even finding the Master Sword wasn't. Ganon was especially too easy and such a nonsense fight. You can skip most of Ganon's tower with Revali's gale. 

I enjoyed some of the exploration. Just sight seeing and the beautiful freaking grass. Just imagine if they made 12 or so ""major"" temples. Each very unique and difficult to discover. I guess that's what I was expecting in BOTW. Not 120 repetitive mini dungeons. 

I don't know what else to say that I'm sure has already been said by others displeased with BOTW. I would rank it definitely above SS, but not better than the greats I mentioned at the beginning.

I'm ready to be downvoted. I guess I came to vent. 

Tl;dr BOTW is not even the top 6 of my favorite Zelda because stuff "
2534,I enjoy my Steaks rare with no steak sauce. Therefore I have excellent taste. 
3939,"I never expected Nintendo to outdo themselves or try to one up Ocarina of Time by making a game that was like OoT. I applaud them for going a very different direction and not sticking to ""making every Zelda game like OoT because it sold well""

However, I think the direction they took it was too far off from what a Zelda title should be. I agree that the gameplay made up for the very weak aspects in other areas, hence I suggested to imagine having BOTW have 12 hidden dungeons scattered throughout rather than have 120 dungeons that all look the same, and 4 bigger dungeons that still all look the same. ""Shoot this eyeball, Shoot this other eyeball, oh look! a mini guardian! Now back to eyeballs, insert 3 simple puzzles, and voila!""

As for the emptiness of the world, I understand the story is meant for it to be physically empty. OoT for example had a very empty Overworld. So did Termina Field. But for some reason that's very hard for me to explain, is that although these overworlds were way smaller, it felt larger. Because it created this sense of adventure, heroism, inspiration, and destiny that most Zelda games emulate. A link to the Past had a very ""busy"" overworld and that in a sense felt twice as big as BOTW. The scenery was astounding in BOTW for sure, but just felt emotionally empty I guess you could say.

Yes Zora's domain was one of my favorite moments, and I loved the character of Sidon as I mentioned. It's one of the areas that truly felt great. And I also agree with the Rito village. WW did the Rito a hundred times better than BOTW, almost felt like a slap in the face with that Falco copy character they had. "
4605,"Yes I agree about the enemies. I should have mentioned I enjoyed the intelligence and ability to learn. That was really cool.

But picture the creativity there, verses the bland repetitive 4 ""ganons"" in the temples. Sure they had very different movesets, but they all looked the same! Even Ganon himself looked the same. The end fight with Ganon in Hyrule field was just basically standing there and you shoot light arrows at glowing parts of his body. It could have been done so much better. You could say it was as simple as OOT Ganon where you just hit his tail, but it had this ""effect"" to it that just felt right. 

Imagine in BOTW (I mentioned this in another reply to a comment) that there were 12 or so dungeons in the Overworld. All hidden. You may find a clue or two but that's it. NES Zelda was ridiculous as to how they hid their dungeons, but remember that feeling of blowing up the mountain, and discovering an entrance. You enter and here you are... a whole new dungeon to explore. 

Discovering a shrine in the same way was cool and all, but it became more of ""oh here's another shrine... I'll finish this in 5 minutes, get my blessing, and move on. 

I much rather discover major dungeons and discover heart pieces that discover a shrine and knowing in advance it's just a puzzle with a blessing at the end that I can trade in for health or stamina. Just the fact that knowing a shrine I discovered is no different from the others except from puzzle format bothers me I suppose. 

Don't get me wrong, the game is great. But in comparison to the high standards of other Zelda titles it feels lackluster. Though I wholeheartedly support Nintendo's decision for changing the formula a bit, for every Zelda game should not be clones of each other. I just felt it went too far off there marker.

"
5010,"The Zora board was the first one I went to in my open exploration. Maybe that's the reason my expectations tripled after I was done with it. It was so much of a higher quality than the others, that all the others after that felt like an extremely sharp decline in creativity. I felt that ""wow"" factor as I trekked my way to the domain and entered. I felt the same way when I entered Zoras domain in OoT. Just ""wow... this hike got me here, and now there's so much to explore and interact with! There's a dungeon, but how do I enter? I'll look for clues and explore"" type of thing. "
6016,"Yeah I have to kind of see it that way. I didn't mind other things people complained about such as weapons breaking and cooking. I'm ok with them changing things up and trying new things, and I felt it was interesting. But my god, the essence of Zelda is lost in translation I feel. I always knew whatever ""secret"" I discovered was 99% of the time going to be a shrine. Whoop de doo. 

Comparing that to other Zelda games, what secret will I find here?? A dungeon? A new item? Maybe a heart piece or a NPC that will give me some treasure. Perhaps this will lead to a secret area that will strike me with familiarity or perhaps I will get lost. You had no idea whatsoever what will be revealed. NES Zelda you moved a gravestone and went down and you found the last sword upgrade! What an amazing find! I remember how excited I was that I found it. 

Or a link to the Past where you threw a rock into a circle of stones and got the quake medallion? Instead of only finding Koroks and more shrines?

How about PLOT TWISTS (just thought of this one!)
Alttp had you being thrown into the dark world (awesome moment) or link time skip in OOT. Or Tetra being Zelda and finding Hyrule underneath the freaking ocean. Even TP had better a better climax. 

What could have been, I felt. Everything was expected. I knew I would find this shrine behind a rock I blew up, I knew where the dungeons were, I knew after I got them all I could go to Ganons tower, I knew the Master Sword would be in the most ""foresty"" part of the map, and I knew that suspicious rock I picked up would have a Koroks underneath it. 

But it's a good exploration Zelda game. How many of the 900 Koroks can you find in his beautiful serene relaxing land as the grass rolls in the wind like the waves of a sea. It is beautiful and peaceful. Not even being sarcastic it really is a beautiful land and definitely a ""chill"" experience."
7829,"I agree. Everything can be expected a short while after starting it. Nothing really surprised me. They couldn't even change the enemies in the trials of strength. It was literally the same mini guardian with different degrees of health. They had the same attack patterns. You kill it, get your chest at the end, continue.

In every other Zelda there was always that measure of ""what lies beyond this, or what secret does this hold?""

Imagine for example Skyrim there's 120 caves and all the caves have a hidden lever and rotating pillars and at the end you always find a level up book. Sometimes the caves have a bandit that you have to kill and you get your book there too. Yeah. "
27812,"Yeah I agree with this. I also felt like maybe the ability to do everything at once was too much. Guess what happened if you walked into a dungeon you weren't supposed to in the original NES for instance?  You either grew a pair and did it, or came back later. That's the part of discovery. You can make a mental note of where it was and come back later. That's what I expected when I heard open world Zelda I suppose. I can even accept the only 4 dungeons, as MM had only 4 but it still felt right. There was life there. Here it's literally 4 similar looking dungeons with eyeballs blocking pathways. No memorable music and only mini guardians as enemies when you fight them enough in the shrines.

Then 120 shrines that also all look the same with the same music. I still go back and listen to the Wind walker overworld music or Gerudo Fortress in OOT. I would never go back and listen to ""BOTW shrine music"" on YouTube. By the 20tg shrine I was sick of it. 

Think of when you did the first 3 temples in Alttp and you rushed to the master sword and pulled it out, then the classic overworld Zelda theme played and replaced the lost woods track. That was AWESOME! And then feeling this power and motivation to go rescue Zelda and storm the castle, wiping the floor with enemies that threw themselves at you to stop you. Such a memorable moment and that was after only what? The first 1/3rd of the game?

Or finally getting the sail in WW and feeling the beauty of discovery? What treasure awaited in these waters? Definitely not going to pull out 1 out of 900+ Koroks! Maybe some rupees or a heart piece. Maybe a treasure map that will lead to something great.

Remember how creepy the bottom of the well was in OoT? 

Stuff like this is what I wanted from BOTW. Although the overworld and exploring was pretty, and expansive, it just felt empty and unrewarding, devoid of life and reason that Zelda games breathe into its worlds. Jeez. "
28094,"I think I could have wrote a 12 page article about what was wrong with BOTW and how it can be improved. And you're probably right. I would make a bad reviewer. I just wrote my thoughts down. I'm glad you enjoyed BOTW and I enjoyed some parts of it as well. Just a lot of other parts made it disappointing.

It can be a good base game and idea for something more amazing. The potential is definitely there."
64674,"100% agree especially the 12 major dungeons part, which I elaborated on in another persons reply here. And make those dungeons hidden. Or at least half of them very well hidden. 

A simple thing could have been put in a ""music"" tune which could play older or remastered Zelda music while in the overworld. 

The sense of rewarding discovery is greatly missing "
4988868,Yeah it's pretty disappointing. I still feel the same way and haven't touched the game in awhile even after the doc came out. It just doesn't motivate me to search endless hours for repetitive shrines and already knowing what my reward is.
