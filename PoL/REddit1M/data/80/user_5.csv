3639,"Being on par with OoT is actually an opinion. Even though I am disappointed with a lack of story and character development, I honestly think BotW is my favorite Zelda game now, surpassing my previous favorite of LTTP. (Doesn't mean I wouldn't go back and play older games more, though, but that's because they're shorter. :D)"
