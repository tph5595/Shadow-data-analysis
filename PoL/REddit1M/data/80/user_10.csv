8804,"the core distinction between BotW overworld and the overworld in the other games is predictability.

they over-extended on the size of the world and as a result the quality of the content to fill that world suffered. where-as smaller overworlds like in OoT/TP/Majora's mask feel just as good if not better due to the variety and lack of predictability in the content.

to take a specific example from breath of the wild, i was really excited to do the quests for the shrines of courage/wisdom/power but once i caught on that the reward for my efforts would be a shrine most likely with a weapon that is just going to break after one fight or an ingredient really kills the enjoyment of exploring the world. literally kills the sense of discovery.

not to mention the sheer number of korok seeds compared to everything else. i would be willing to bet they outnumber everything else to discover put together"
9595,"the world is far from empty, there are shrines and korok seeds EVERYWHERE. and that is what people don't like i'm pretty sure because they make up about 60-80% of the content to discover i'm pretty sure"
