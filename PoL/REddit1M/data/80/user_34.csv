But then, Breath of the Wild focused a whole lot more on being a truly open game that let's you go anywhere, over anything. You see it? You can reach it. And the combat, despite the limited families of monsters, is pretty nice.

So while there is a lot that I miss, I can appreciate the new benefits enough that I'm still playing. They tend to try something different with each Zelda game, so here's hoping the next one can find a way to incorporate the open world freedom of BotW with the lovely-designed architecture of Skyward Sword.

very important edit:

The Chus. BotW definitely has the best ChuChus in any Zelda game, even better than Wind Waker's. Seriously, just look at those guys with their derpy eyes. And when you throw bombs on them, THEIR GELATINOUS SURFACE WIGGLES AND DIPS ON CONTACT oh my goodness they're the best. BotW ChuChus forever."
