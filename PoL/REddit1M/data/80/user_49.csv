I prefer story driven RPGs rather than exploration because I have very limited gaming time and exploring without the possibility of discovering new and unique items sounds unrewarding, so I think you've saved me a bunch of time.

What are your thoughts about the game now, after a month plus since the post? Have you made peace with it for what it is?"
