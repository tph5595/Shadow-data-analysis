6576,"My feelings to BOTW have grown steadily lukewarm.

I wouldn't call it ""bad"" by any means, but I think it partially failed to deliver on the feeling of discovery in your exploration.

After a certain point, I was no longer finding anything new. It was just ""another dragon, another steppe talus, another Fairy Fountain, another Labyrinth"" etc. Pretty much EVERYTHING in this game could be found in any three or four regions, I'm sure, and the rest are just filled with re-skinned variations of them. That absolutely dragged the wonder of exploring for me.

Not to mention there's the completely underwhelming sidequests, and the lackluster story. It just feels like a game that was satisfying while it lasted, but it gives me nothing that makes me want to go back and play some more."
9233,"Is that actually what Skyrim's like? I never played it.

But yeah, if they could've nailed the sense of discovery, I'd probably still be playing it, like so many other people are.

Imagine if you could, from any starting point, choose any direction to go in, and in the next 40 minutes you'd find like three things you'd never seen before. Maybe a tree that bears a special fruit, or a cave containing enemies you won't find anywhere else.

The way the game jumps you with a Steppe Talus on the Great Plateau made it look to me like the world would be crawling with new surprises like that around every corner, but it so rarely did anything of the sort."
9496,"I'd say it started to wane for me at around the 40 hour mark. This was after I finished the second Divine Beast and decided to go exploring. It really started to feel like I was going through the motions by then, and I just wanted to wrap things up.

If it's still exciting to you, more power to ya. But it just feels like an empty excursion to me, now. The overworld just feels like a giant checklist. Every time I found a Fairy Fountain, I thought how much more interesting it would've been if it kept the same function, but at least looked entirely different. Some other strange entity that offers to upgrade your gear?"
11345,"The idea of where a sequel might go is what excites me, because the groundwork for this game is great. It has an intention to push open world games into what they should've been years ago.

But, seeing as I have an image in my head of what this formula will look like when a future game comes closer to perfecting it, BOTW feels like it comes up so short. It's like if we had the first FPS game that used the second analog stick and cover, and this was such an exciting step in the right direction that we didn't really care for how it fell short in so many other areas, but once these advancements become the norm this revolutionary title becomes more difficult to return to.

BOTW is pushing open world games to where I want them to go, but it on its own just isn't for me."
13043,"Yes. One Zelda formula I wish they had revised along with others is that there's so rarely just one, of something.

Largely this goes hand-in-hand with my criticism of there not being something new, after a while, but I think it's a bad move to have three dragons, or three labyrinths, etc. If they were unique, solitary things, they remain magical in hindsight. 

The second time I saw a dragon or a labyrinth, the magic of the first sighting drained fast.

Instead of another dragon, you could have a phoenix, maybe?"
13305,"I've been so on the fence about which Elder Scrolls game to play. I've never played one and I certainly don't have time for all three.

Morrowind looks like it has the most creative, memorable world, but the most dated mechanics.

Oblivion apparently has the best quests, but its setting looks like every other fantasy world ever.

Skyrim looks somewhat unique with its Norse look and has the better updated mechanics, but also has some of the most repetition.

This is all based on what I've heard of it.

Also, I'm not interested in mods. I prefer to play a game as it was packaged to me."
13475,"In my perfect world, BOTW would've had just one Divine Beast, Vah Nabooris.

Other dungeons, all aesthetically different, would be scattered around everywhere.

Your whale suggestion is great, because that's the kind of diversity the dungeons should have, like how Jabu Jabu and the Snow Mansion all feel kind of out of left field."
14746,"'Same here.

For a while, I made a hobby out of coming up with sidequests I could make using BOTW's items and Link's moveset."
14860,"Huhhhhhh... 'Sounds like I'm coming back round to Oblivion again. I've constantly tried to find excuses to edge towards Skyrim, just because that one's more iconic, but I feel insecure, every time.

So, how do I you go about getting that mod for Oblivion, anyway? I've never modded before, and hardly trust myself to not make my gaming desktop combust."
23574,Thanks dude. I'll screenshot this for when I need it.
56953,"Seeing a Lurelin got my mind racing, but there turned out to be not much happening there.

That feeling in Wind Waker of arriving at the first few islands and being like ""this is WAY different! What on earth will happen here?"" could be made to endure in a game of BOTW's size."
57086,"The first time I found a Steppe Talus, my mind was racing and I thought the game was gonna keep up surprises like that throughout. Can you imagine an overworld boss surprise like that, unique to every single region?

Like, one could've been at the coast. You see what looks like a lonely little mound with pinetrees on it. You climb on it, but then it starts shaking, and it turns out to be the back of a giant crab monster."
61810,"I didn't need something grand to happen at Lurelin, but I wanted something to do.

'Wouldn't bother me so much if it weren't the only village the plot doesn't directly lead you to.

There's genuinely nothing special about the village at all. People are only excited about it because it was a surprise, but there should've been several surprise villages throughout this game. Aonuma specifically said he wanted to capture that feeling in Skyrim of wandering over a hill and being met with a village you had no idea was there, and they did it one time?"
63996,"That unique player experience story is perfectly adequate, but that could've been achieved even if they did add plenty more to find. You could still be wandering lost in the Hebrew mountains.

If anything, adding more overworld bosses and things to find, if done right, could add even further to the unique player experience; how you find them, how you beat them, how you avoid them, like with the scattered Hinox' and Lynels."
66584,"Exactly. Heck the North West would've been a fantastic opportunity, given the blizzards. You'd just see some unfamiliar silhouette, be like ""what the hell is that...?"" and then it charges out at you.
