It really feels like the only people who describe BOTW as revolutionary don't play open world games. "

Because that's what climbing in Zelda is around for, just for the fuck of it. It's not fun, it's not rewarding. It's just there.  It's definitely not fucking revolutionary. "

Honestly, I don't think you've ever played an open world game before. "
