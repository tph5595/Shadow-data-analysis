22323,"As someone else said, my feelings toward the game have gotten worse as time went on. 

The main things I was disappointed in were the narrative and the lack of usual dungeons.

The things I found disappointing in the narrative were the lack of a plot twist, a lack of a decent villain (I'd take Ghirahim or Ganondorf over Clammy Gann anytime.), lack of screentime for the champions, and a very lackluster ending. The memory system was also very lacking imo

As I also said, the dungeons were disappointing. The Divine Beasts werent a good substitute for regular dungeons. (What happened to dungeons like OoT's Forest Temple, TP's Arbiter's Grounds, and Temple of Time?)

Needless to say, I'm hoping the next Zelda will bring back regular dungeons and a better storyline."
