I still get goosebumps when I hear the strings in Rito Village. Or when I replay the battle vs. Ganon, and the music of [the four freed divine beast kicks in](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PqXj1DQrqA). I still hear the whole soundtrack when I work, it's epic and yet calm and relaxed. Not to mention the opening theme.. shivers."
