3016,"Even though I liked a few other games better than BoTW, that doesn't take away from how good BoTW is. Just because it isn't as good as some of the best games of all time doesn't make it bad or even a let down. I loved it, but didn't think even for a second that it was better than OoT, WW, or MM. 

I think what most people liked was that it switched up the style, BoTW plays more like an RPG than most other Zelda games. The variety of weapons, armor, and quests is something seen in very few of the other games. That paired with the combat, exploration, and size of the game make up for the underdeveloped story and generally weak characters for most people. Regardless of how you feel about the story, the gameplay was very strong.

Plus some of your complaints are in the game intentionally. The world being empty is huge part of the story, calamity Gannon destroyed almost everything, that's like literally the whole point. There's a lot of empty space in most Zelda games, but the fact that BoTW is so huge makes it seem even worse. The world being big and empty is intentional, so I don't really have much of an issue with it, although it certainly can be boring at times. 

The biggest issue for me was that some of the areas felt really half assed, like the Rito. Literally like 10 people live there, the guy who helps you get inside the beast is a boring random soldier, and the only ""test"" he gives you is to shoot targets with a bow. On the other hand, Zora's domain- where the characters are significantly more developed and you have to encounter a Lynel just to get into the beast- was awesome, not sure why they were seemingly lazy about most other boards. 

I think there should've been at least a little more character development and story, but from a gameplay perspective it's one of the best. Sure, overall it's not exactly on par with OoT but what is? "
3743,"That's true, but everything about one game being better than another is opinion. I said that because my favorite is OoT and so is OPs"
4540,"Yeah I agree, especially about the lack of real dungeons. 

The Zora board is to me what this game should've/could've been. You have multiple intriguing characters to interact with, a good amount of backstory that's relevant to link, even traveling to the domain with Sidon was more fun than just about every other board. The quest to get into the beast was hard but there was a few ways to go about it- sneak around the Lynel, kill it, or even getting arrows elsewhere. Then you have the Rito where it's like ""hey can you hit a target?"". 

If all/most of the areas were like the Zora board then the game would've been worth the hype imo, but most of the world and people are bland, there's very few real challenges, and ultimately it lacks a lot of what makes Zelda games Zelda games. To me the superior gameplay and exploration doesn't make up for those issues- at least not completely-, but to some people they do. "
9848,"""Wow that rock doesn't belong here, I wonder what's under it"" 

Oh my god its another Korok seed! Just what I needed! What a surprise!

/ s obviously 

The world is empty if the only thing it's filled with is repetition. Especially Korok seeds which are pretty useless after the first few and only take like 5 seconds to get. The shrines were cool but were generally really simple and repetitive "
13220,"I didn't have an issue with him, he just had no character development and his entire backstory was that he was a solider "
14417,"FO2 is not a fair comparison since it's an entirely different format. You don't really have to walk across an entire open world just to get somewhere. FONV on the other hand was amazing, but really the only one in the series (since it went 3D) that didn't have huge areas of nothing. FO3 was fun but very empty outside of specific areas and FO4 didn't even have real dialogue 

But overall yeah, that's a pretty big flaw with BoTW. I think they handled Zora's domain well, but outside of that the other cities/towns were extremely underwhelming. "
20335,Yeah I had no idea why Zelda just had British accent 
34764,"You really think BoTW has the better story? I could see why people would prefer it because of the open world, rpg elements, climbing, graphics, general gameplay, etc, but I really don't see the argument for story.

The only character that gets any development in BoTW is Zelda, who only appears in memories and end game. All the other champions get like 2 minutes on screen. Even link's memories serve more to show Zelda's failure and his relationship with Zelda more than they develop his character. 

In OoT link definitely gets more character development. We hear about him being an exile as child, his friendship with Saria, we get to see link's relationships with the sages (as opposed to his relationship with the champions, which we get almost none of), and ultimately we see his rise from an outcasted kid to the Hero of Time. In BoTW link is already significant as he already had the master sword and was the Hylian champion. 

There's a good amount of small things that are important to the story too like getting Epona, rather than just catching a random horse as an adult, you get to use the one you befriend as a child. There's a lot of things like that in OoT that we don't get in BoTW, like the sheik/Zelda dynamic or even just the songs and their significance. Compare the songs to the sheikah slate, the songs all have varying levels of significance to link and/or the history of LoZ/Hyrule, the slate is just a magic iPad made from ancient technology. Small things go a long way for developing story/lore. For example, in Twilight princess we get to see Hero's Shade and get an explanation about the child timeline. We don't get anything like that in BoTW, we don't even get an explanation about what calamity Gannon is. 

Almost every part of the plot is important to OoT while the only real story we get in BoTW is through very brief flashbacks that essentially tell us nothing besides that Gannon succeeded due to Zelda's failure. Sure, we get to take back the beasts and beat Gannon, but that's not really an amazing story without any context. Basically all of the memories are summed up in a few pages of Zelda diary which you can read in Hyrule castle, you can't say the same about OoT. 

Also lore wise OoT is the most significant game in the series. In addition to being the game that results in the timeline split, we get to see Gannondorf as human and how he became Gannon. In BoTW we get 0 backstory on Gannon, the beasts, or even the other champions. We don't even know what timeline it's on. All we know is that Gannon is an evil entity that destroyed almost everything 100 years ago and the beasts are ancient technology. 

If you like BoTW better for any reason other than story, I can definitely see an argument. I just don't see how the stories are really comparable; to each his own I guess. "
69186,"Yeah I agree to an extent, the issue for me is that there's so much missed potential. No one outside of Zelda gets any real character development. Even link hardly has a backstory; the only thing we know is he was a knight (eventually appointed to be Zelda's personal knight) and that at heart he's somewhat goofy and likes food- which is basically every link. The other champions who should be significant to the story- or at least to link- get like one 15 second flashback each that only really shows us their powers. 

It's also not like OoT doesn't have a great narrative. We get to see an outcasted kid who doesn't fit in anywhere become the hero of time. That's like the biggest underdog story ever, and who doesn't love a good underdog story? Also if you're into the lore, we see OoT/HoT link as maybe the most tragic character in all of Zelda. He saves the world, only to be sent back into time where he's just an exiled child, he losses the only friend who was with him through his adventure (Navi), and live through the regret of not being remembered despite being the most important hero in the history of Hyrule- which is how we get the hero's shade later on. Most kids dream of being a hero, imagine being the most important hero in history, but no know one knows it was you, you're still an exile with no friends (even navi leaves), and you have nothing to show for it but your memories. You'd probably go insane, since everyone would laugh at you for even suggesting that you were the HoT.

Perhaps my biggest issue with BoTWs story is that the primary boss/evil in the game is just an entity, he's basically just a cloud of evil and that's his backstory. It's not like Ganondorf who becomes the dark king and then Gannon, all while mocking Link and Hyrule along the way. In BoTW he's basically just ""evil"" with no real explanation. Also like I said about the songs vs slate comparison, we don't get any new insight on the Sheikah basically everything interesting about guardians and the technology is summed up by ""ancient technology that we don't understand"".   

For me at least OoT wins on:
- link's backstory (not even close)
- enemy backstory (not even close)
- overall plot
- minor details
- relationships shown between characters (outside of Zelda and links relationship, which can't really be compared since in OoT they don't know each other before the plot)

The only area where BoTW is better story wise is Zelda, who we see fail and then ultimately succeed with link's help. That's a cool narrative for sure, but on its own doesn't mean that much if all the other characters are underdeveloped. There was potential for this to be the best story yet, but I think they swung and missed by failing to explain basically everything other than Zelda's failure. "
102567,"&gt; some of your complaints can be said about other games in the series

Yeah obviously. I'm not comparing it to all the games or saying it was bad, I loved BoTW. I was pointing out that it has a very weak story, especially when compared to OoT.

&gt; how's link backstory better in OoT

I didn't say his backstory was better, I said his character development was. I prefer the OoT background since we get to see him rise from a outcasted kid to hero, but that's not the argument I was making. In BoTW he's already a hero and we don't even see it in game, let alone getting the play as him as he becomes the hero. It's just ""yeah you're a famous hero, now go save the day again"". 

&gt; he's a hylian raised by ... the only one that didn't pick on him was Saria

Which is why his character is more interesting. He's not really Hylian- just look at how Hylians interact with him like with Malon calling ""fairy boy""- and he's obviously not a Kokiri. He's alone from the start and over comes the odds to become the hero of time. That's a way deeper story than ""he's already the hero but the princess fucked up so here try again"". 

&gt; Compare that to Link being raised in a family of the royal guard, training to be a soldier like his father, earning the master sword, being selected to guard Zelda, complicated relationships with the other champions

We literally see none of this in game or in flash backs (besides being selected to guard Zelda). The relationships with the other champions were essentially non-existent. Each champ got one 15 *second* flashback, and that was primarily to showcase their power. If their relationship were more in depth this game could've been so much better (story wise at least) but they weren't.

&gt; are being super nit picky 

Of course, the game was awesome. That doesn't mean it was perfect though. It was very weak story wise, lacked any semblance of character development (outside of Zelda who we don't even interact with during the game), and had very underwhelming bosses. That's about where the criticisms start and end.  

Edit- some clarity/typos"
104838,"&gt; Zelda tells you of Links family and you see him training in a flashback. You also see the aftermath of Link fighting a veritable army and Zelda starting to warm up to Link. Go back and watch the memories again.

Yeah Zelda mentions it in a flashback, we don't actually see it. The entirety of the story is told through short flashbacks

&gt; You mean to tell me you didn't pick up on Revali being envious of Link's position as the hero, Mipha having feelings for Link, Urbosa having a big-sister like relationship with Zelda, or Daruk trying to bring the team together? 

I mean yeah but that doesn't tell us a whole lot, just their main personality trait/most notable characteristic. Revali is arrogant/egotistical and jealous, Daruk is upbeat, Urbosa is compassionate, and Mipha was sweet (also in love with link, but that was mentioned/implied before the flashback). We get 0 about their in life feats, how they became champions, them taming the beasts, etc. 

&gt; so much of the story from the other games has been only skin deep, so I don't get why they would get a pass on this but BOTW doesn't

No one is saying it doesn't get a pass or that it's a bad game. Just that the story is weak, even for a Zelda game. I'd definitely give it a pass, but if someone asks about the story or is criticizing it, then I think it's fair to mention how the story is basically just 17 short flashbacks that tell us very little about our hero, our villain, and the other champions. They're almost all about Zelda who isn't even in the game until the ending. To play a ton of hours and only get a few minutes of actual story can be pretty underwhelming imo, especially if you have to specifically seek out that story. "
