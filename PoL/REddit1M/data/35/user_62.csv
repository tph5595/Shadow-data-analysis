Thats the german version, here is the text if you want to google translate it yourself or something.

""Ob der Held die Meere Ã¼berquert oder eine Verbindung mit der Vergangenheit eingeht""

The reason other languages are used as evidence is because this is mentioned when the focus switches to the champions talking, it is just easier to hear what zelda says in other languages because the audio is mixed differently. If you listen closely to the english version you can hear mention of the seas and time, so its not just a language thing."

There are [normal zora](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda/images/4/41/Zora_%28Oracle_of_Ages%29.png/revision/latest?cb=20091227001004) in the fallen timeline, there are even [bird people](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda/images/e/e7/Fokka.png/revision/latest?cb=20090726184754) that could easily become the rito.

In the downfall timeline, link died in the final battle, so he still fought with the sages, he just died at the same time. The sages were still fondly remembered though as evidenced by the towns in zelda 2.

There are also locations that have only appeared in the downfall timeline references, like Rauru town."

Its even a self contradicting statement since the hero of time never pulled the master sword in the child timeline so it would have nothing to do with him. It seems like when you put all the references together it isn't about timelines its just a meta reference to all of the main games where the master sword has appeared."
