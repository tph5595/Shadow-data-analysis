26993,I think Aonuma has no clue about timelines and just says that it's after all other Zeldas
27306,"She references games in other timelines, that's at least strange isn't it? Always the flaming when you post something Zeldafans don't like to hear."
28039,"Zelda directly referencing the other games is something else as seeing a Mario doll in a shop. I'd consider the first thing as canon.

The only way I see this working is if all three timelines merged somehow."
28857,"They reference other Zelda stories. It's more likely that they're canon references than that they're myths that hold no truth, because the events that are described happened in other Zeldas. It's ignorant to assume they hold no truth because it seems to not fit in the timeline."
38306,"Of course it is! If they wanted to add fairytales that aren't true they would have done that. They wouldn't use events from past games as a story that is not true, because it would only confuse people.

There's evidence for all three timelines. One possible explanation is a convergence of timelines. If you must pick one, the strongest piece of evidence is thousands of years after TP, because Zelda references ""Skyward Bound, traveling though time, and traveling through the embers of Twilight"".


Yeahhh. surely only the embers of Twilight part is a myth, and the other two happened for real....  "
