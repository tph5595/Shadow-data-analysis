23219,"Yeah, my understanding was that at some point after all the other games, Sheikah civilization peaks and develops the guardians and the other tech, THEN 10k years (or some other long ass time) pass, hyrule falls to Calamity Ganon, THEN 100 years pass and you hit the title sequence."
23281,"yeah, but you also have overt references and elements from the other timelines. I'm of the opinion that the game takes place so far after the others that the timelines have essentially remerged."
26421,I'm 99% certain these are the first Korok and Rito we've seen outside of the Windwaker timeline. That's fairly explicit.
28400,"&gt;Kokiri

Which also don't exist explicitly outside that timeline. Korok's only exist in WW, and Kokiri weren't seen again after Ocarina, I believe. Right around the time of the split.

&gt;Rito, which means they now exist in that timeline

I'm not sure I can take that as anything other than an easter egg. I'd have to see a reference to them in the original release of TP for that to convince me of their existence in that timeline.

Beyond what I mentioned earlier, you've also got a living Deku Tree (Ocarina - WW), the ancient sea mentioned in an item description (Ocarina - WW),  the location of the master sword (Link to the past), Zelda's referencing of TP. That sounds to me like all of these stories exist in some form in BotW's extremely distant past. 
"
31045,"&gt;The location of the master sword is LITERALLY irrelevant, it's where Zelda leaves it prior to the story starting.

So it's irrelevant when I use it

&gt;The Master Sword is buried underwater

but relevant when you do? If you're going to use this as a disqualification, you must also apply the same logic to TP since the master sword is returned to the Sacred Grove near the Temple of Time, and there is no location for the master sword near the ruins of the temple of time in BotW.




&gt;But beyond any of this. BOTW CAN'T be in Wind Waker's timeline. The Master Sword is buried underwater, and they leave Hyrule.

There's nothing to say that the sea didn't recede, and that they didn't come back to Hyrule, is there? 

&gt;the Rito thing... why would that be an easter egg? They ACTIVELY added Rito to the game in the form of carvings, why would they do that?

Why wouldn't it be an easter egg? There's nothing to say it has any more significance than that, is there?

If you're gonna take the stance ""Maybe its all coincidental"" to all of my points, I think this conversation has run its course.

32792,"Been a while since I played windwaker, but I'm certain they make similar (if not quite as heavy handed) references there as well. My thinking is that these Koroks are too similar to the WW ones in art style to be anything other than a continuation of Kokiri (Ocarina) -&gt; Koroks (Wind Waker) -&gt; Long ass time -&gt; Korok (BotW)."
34173,"&gt; I'm not saying it's the case, just that it's silly to rule it out, but 100 years before BotW could have been something like 80 years after OoT. 

This is definitely not. One of the Zora slates references (by name) Princess Ruto, stating that the Divine Beast was named after her. [Check around 9:30 in this video](http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2017/03/24/a-very-nerdy-conversation-about-breath-of-the-wilds-place-in-the-zelda-timeline.aspx) for that. Given that it's referencing when the beast was built, not recovered, that would indicate a huge amount of time between Ocarina and BotW.

&gt;I think your order is way over-complicated

Fair enough. Its not like Zelda lore and geography has ever been particularly simple, what with alternate realms, holy floods, and floating landmasses crashing down. I just don't think its possible to definitively say BotW falls into a particular timeline given the number of references to all of them. Not that it really matters in the grand scheme of things anyway."
34627,"My assumption would be that they were named by the same Sheikah Civilization that created them. I didn't see anything indicating otherwise.

Agreed. As irrelevant as the Zelda timeline is to the quality of the games, I enjoy the interconnectedness and all the little references, and how it permeates the game."
35039,"Well, in the case of Vah Ruta, the Zora history tablet would be a written record. It's not unreasonable to think the other civilizations would have records of them as well, even if they aren't actually in the game.

 Might just be a case that the divine beasts were considered mythological up until they actually unearthed them again?"
