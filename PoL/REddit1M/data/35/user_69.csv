63225,"&gt;Yeah, there's obviously that infamous ""Game Over Return of Ganon""

Yeah, the monsters are trying to get Link's blood to perform a dark ritual and resurrect him, but don't succeed (barring Nintendo deciding that the Game Over there creates another time line split)


&gt; In the same way people don't notice that it's the same Link in the majority of the downfall timeline games

It's the same link in 1 and 2, and the same link in LttP and LA, and prior to the new book that was released recently in Japan the oracle games were LttP Link as well, but those were apparently changed to be their own Link, which is more in line with the fact that Zelda in those games doesn't know you."

126149,"Well, the Deku Tree's story makes it seem like the golden goddesses created the entire world, and hyrule was just the center of it. Destroying the triforce should start to tear it apart, the adult timeline in general doesn't really make a whole lot of sense anymore."
