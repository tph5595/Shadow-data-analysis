56820,Ruto being mentioned as a sage who fought alongside a hero against human ganon(dorf) (adult timeline OoT) is fairly explicit
57190,"afair the same zora tablet also mentions that the events of OoT happened long before 10,000 years ago, so the ancient technology could not have existed in that time frame. I might be misremembering though. I wish I could find this plate again"
60228,"wanna get your mind blown? [this is the map of hyrule as seen in spirit tracks](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda/images/0/0e/New_Hyrule.png/revision/latest?cb=20100106200631)... spot some similarities?

It's probably the stupidest cop out and I'd hate it if it was legit canon, but there is grounds to believe BOTW Hyrule is actually the new Hyrule established by the time spirit tracks happens. Alternatively, I had an idea of BOTW taking place in a timeline split after TWW in which King Daphnes doesn't intervene Ganondorf's Triforce wish for the resurfacing of Hyrule, but he still gets his ass handed by Link and Zelda so they go on and reestablish old Hyrule. PH and ST wouldn't happen in this timeline. It is completely hypothetical, but would be logically consistent (save for the myriads of references to all timelines that make people scratch their heads)"

Desertification is a geological process that can settle in after longer periods of time. There has never been another Hyrule map with simultaneous icy mountain ranges in the northwest, a volcano in the northeast, a foresty area between those 2, a foresty area in the south, ocean shorelines along the south and southeast borders of the kingdom and a small island with a steep hill in the southeast not too far away from the shorelines. I find the resemblance uncanny honestly"
