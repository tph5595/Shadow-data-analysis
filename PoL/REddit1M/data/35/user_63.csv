ALTTP had a long stretch of grass before it and a plaque that explained the prophecy of the Master Sword. Also, there was no Deku Tree in ALTTP despite the fact that this Deku Tree has existed since the dawn of time."

This just doesn't seem like a spoiler since most people (like myself) probably didn't even notice this when they first saw it, and it has 0 impact on story/gameplay/overall experience. However, even knowing that Link will be able to use a sword in this game (despite it being the most obvious mechanic to return) is a spoiler to someone since they would've found out when they first played the game."
