38532,"Twilight Princess does have a giant statue of the three of them that Ganon brought down though.

Skyward Sword does *mention* the Golden Goddesses, the Hylia focus was just because the story revolved around her.

In Breath of the Wild, Nayru is mentioned at least once from what I've seen.

Also, the Golden Goddesses are said to have abandoned Hyrule after creating it, the Triforce being their lasting influence on it. Whereas Hylia is an active lesser Goddess left behind by them."

Sorry, but NoA has a godawful track record for localizing Zelda games."

39137,"In Twilight Princess the Light Spirits specifically mention the Golden Goddesses creating them to do theirs jobs.

Can you give me an example of worship and general gods talk involving them outside of anything related to the Triforce so I get on the same page as you here."
