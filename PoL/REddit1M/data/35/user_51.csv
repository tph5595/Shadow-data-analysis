32895,"It's the Earth Spring I think, here's the cutscene (Skyward Sword plot spoilers) https://youtu.be/SnhP8pj_pSA?t=32s in SS this spring is in the Eldin region. 

The other spring in SS is the Skyview Spring in the Faron region, that's the first temple you visit in the game. For comparison.  https://youtu.be/O-80w-WdNzg?t=6m43s

as you can see they look very similar in layout. The only one that looks close to this is the Spring of Power in the Eldin region. (well it has been well over 10,000 years, probably closer to 15-20,000 since SS takes place well before OOT)

I can't find any comparison videos approaching the Spring of Courage and Power in BOTW to do a shot by shot to see the similarities. Someone who does the youtube gaming stuff should do that. "
33351,"She also references the downfall with a link to the past in other languages too. 

Plus you can find the Arbiters Ground in the Gerudo Desert, there are landscape features like the Dueling Peaks and Spectacle Rock that are landscape features in Zelda one. They took all three timelines and mashed them in a big ole ball. I wouldn't try to make too much sense of it. I think thats why they put it so far ahead of any other Zelda game in the timeline, to get away from the whole split "
34044,"It's 10,000 years since the last appearance of Gannon and the use of the Divine Beasts. It's been much, much longer than that since OOT, let alone SS. "
34704,"You can find the Arbiters Ground in the desert, but it doesn't look like much that you'll recognize apart from it's name. 

Spectacle Rock which was in Zelda 1 and a few other games in the downfall timeline [is in BOTW as well](https://1d31c772ec21a65b0a71-0707aae3004193da193e1ad4a942592d.ssl.cf2.rackcdn.com/36286/loz_botw_spectacle_rock__large.jpg). There are several other landscape features that call back to Zelda 1 supposedly, like [this image](http://www.zeldadungeon.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Link-Staring-at-Death-Mountain.jpg). 

Also names of things and places are often after well loved characters and sages.

34772,"it has been over 10,000 years. They probably remodeled it once or twice."
35223,"Not Lanayru. That region in SS was a mine and a desert. The only holy place that Zelda visits there is [the Temple of Time, where the time gate was. The Temple of Time as we know it in most Zelda games got moved to where the second time gate was and where the Goddess Temple came from the sky and landed in the Sealed Grounds. This is the birthplace of Hyrule and where the Great Plateau is in BOTW](/spoilers) Spoilers Skyward Sword."
44313,"Yeah I found that place. I was going off of what the old man said about the plateau as the birthplace of hyrule, but I can be wrong. I'm only casually a Zelda scholar "
45383,"It may, but why let a place like that literally disintegrate if it housed something as important as the twilight mirror? Of course that could have been moved or maybe it's under the sand, if it's a different timeline than the child of course. 

But why even reference it at all, unless it was for fans? [Zelda in the first memory also references the events in TP as part of her knighting speech, as well as events in the other timelines.](/spoiler) memory spoiler. 

The developers of this game have said the timeline was not something they took into heavy consideration when creating BOTW. I know we want to put it in context with the story but… I don't think these games are designed to work that way. 10,000 years ago for us, very little can be directly traced to now, all we have are vague stories and myths and legends. The things that have survived are mysteries, like how the Pyramids were built and what Stonehenge was really for.  We have forgotten a lot… I'm personally impressed that the royal family has kept in power for so long. 

Just saying we may be wasting our breath looking for a linear history. It's a legend after all, and legends get muddy all the time. "
