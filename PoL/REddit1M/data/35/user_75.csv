88380,... were we playing the same game because I don't recall any Rito in Zelda 2...

... That actually makes sense in a certain kind of way. When Lorule's Triforce was destroyed, Lorule itself was about to crumble away. I guess Hyrule's complete flooding satisfied the conditions of that Hyrule's Triforce getting destroyed as well?


I wish that book would release sooner in NA.."
88937,"In fairness, you do see the glimpses of the Triforce from Zelda whenever she finally awakens her power.

I always interpreted the ""ancient power"" that her mother and grandmother held to be a combination of the Triforce and Hylia's golden power getting passed down from mother to daughter

Though if that wind water entry is true, wow, what the heck."

I do remember speculation that people thought ~~Falco~~ Revali in BotW was a Fokka before they officially revealed him as a Rito. But despite both being birds I don't think they have a connection (yet)."
