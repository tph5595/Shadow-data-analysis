22101,Also the Master Sword
22245,"So close. So close yet so far! 

This game can't be in Child timeline because Ruto was a sage. She was not a sage in the child timeline. And no Zelda referencing Twilight is not confirmation. She later talks about Wind Waker and ALttP in the same memory. "
22417,"&gt;I saw a theory that Hyrule Warriors is canon an- 

Well there we go, whole theory falls apart just from that alone. "
24052,"The first one, but this explains it better:

https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/60y3mt/comment/dfasrop?st=J0PMTLH4&amp;amp;sh=cea5e2e1

You can't actually hear Zelda too well in the English version. But in the German one you can hear her clearly. The comment is a translation"
27028,"You don't know what a reference is, do you..."
27638,"Games have always had references to other universes. Duke Nukem is an avid example of this. Doesn't mean that those references are canon. They're nods to other games, simple as that. 

And if you really think that's flaming, I envy you. The shit I've seen said between Xbox, Sony, and Nintendo fans would make children cry. "
28364,... Why? Is it really so hard to think that a legendary sword had fantastical tales that hold no truth (for that timeline) told about it? We have a child's tale about a giant dragging an axe through the ground that resulted in the Grand Canyon. It's not that far fetched to assume random stories were told about the sword 
29443,"So instead of assuming they are offhand tales and stories that sprouted up over thousands of years, a phenomenon we've seen happen in our own history. You want to assume that it is evidence of a timeline convergence. A phenomenon that has no precedent or reason to have happened. Solely because you think one line of dialogue counteracts the multitude of other evidence that points to one specific timeline, downfall. I mean, if you want to. Go for it"
30053,As opposed to some random person in a comment saying they're probably wrong despite having no evidence on the contrary.
30403,"The sages in TP are more akin to spirits of the sages. They're even called ""Ancient Sages"" instead of the Seven Sages like in OoT. They become mortal when the need arises. Much like Link and Zelda when Ganon comes stomping around. "
34273,But Link returning to the Child Timeline circumvents Ruto's need to awaken as a sage
34691,"""When evil rules all, an awakening voice from the Sacred Realm will call those destined to be Sages, who dwell in the five temples. One in a deep forest... One on a high mountain... One under a vast lake... One within the house of the dead... One inside a goddess of the sand...""
-Sheik

The second half is clearly circumstantial since there's not always going to be a deep forest, high mountain, vast lake, and so on. And later from the same wiki page. 

""The Seven Sages, minus Princess Zelda, may be connected to the six Ancient Sages seen in Twilight Princess. It seems that these Sages may be the essences that entered the bodies of those Seven Sages in Ocarina of Time, causing their awakening as sages. It also seems that Rauru could be both an Ancient Sage and one of the Seven Sages.""

The Seven Sages seems to be the mortal incarnations of the sages whereas the ones seen in TP just the spirits. "
38037,The wikia article
38333,"It kinda does: 

""It seems that these Sages may be the essences that entered the bodies of those Seven Sages in Ocarina of Time."""
45299,But it does. Those floaty white guys *are* the ancient sages. They're the spirits.
