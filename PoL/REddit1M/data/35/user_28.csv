21713,"well, BOTW takes place 10k years after whenever Hyrule reaches its peak, so an IMMENSE amount of time has passed... but it can't take place after Wind Waker, because they leave Hyrule.
"
25517,"that too
"
25565,"there was an ancient sea in skyward sword

wind waker's sea was called The Great Sea anyways
"
25688,"it really only matters what she references in Japanese, and maybe English

"
25807,"I don't see anything explicit. There's geography that's named after stuff, but in addition to that possibly just being fan service (Koholit, not Koholint, etc) there's also no reason why locations wouldn't exist in both versions of Hyrule"
27207,"They evolved from the Zora, but there are Rito in the Twilight Princess timeline as well.

Personally I see it as diverging evolution paths, but the Zora died out in Wind Waker because the Great Sea is cursed (so nobody can find Hyrule)"
27280,"Koroks and Rito were first used in Wind Waker, yes, however, Koroks are just some weird form of Kokiri, and Twilight Princess HD added carvings depicting Rito, which means they now exist in that timeline.

Basically the same species came about but under different circumstances
"
30608,"There's nothing that says Koroks aren't just the place Kokiri inevitably end up

the Rito thing... why would that be an easter egg? They ACTIVELY added Rito to the game in the form of carvings, why would they do that?

Why wouldn't a new Deku Tree come to exist regardless of the timeline? In the Adult Timeline the child Deku tree shows up, why wouldn't that happen seven years into the child timeline?

The location of the master sword is LITERALLY irrelevant, it's where Zelda leaves it prior to the story starting.

But beyond any of this. BOTW CAN'T be in Wind Waker's timeline. The Master Sword is buried underwater, and they leave Hyrule.

Even then, Skyward Sword had an ancient sea. wind Waker's Great Sea is different.
"
30636,"TPHD overwrites the old Twilight Princess, that's a general rule of thumb with remasters or remakes
"
31217,"see there's a major key difference here. It's easy to assume Ravio does just randomly have the mask, or it's just a mask that look like it, or whatever. If Ravio's journal literally had him say ""oh so I have majora's mask"" then you wouldn't write it off as an easter egg.

This bit of added art adds a NEW SPECIES to the timeline. It's SUPER blatant, and then they happen to bring back Rito in the next game.

And then you have this quote from Aunoma:

""When I look at this [Twilight Princess] remake, I feel like this is the origin point of the new title we’re making right now. After playing [Twilight Princess] you may have some ""Oh I see!"" moments when playing the new [Wii U] game, so I’ll be glad if you play 'Twilight Princess HD' while waiting in anticipation for the latest title of 'Legend of Zelda'.""

https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/4rn7br/clues_in_twilight_princess_hd_regarding_to_breath/

but no clearly just because they added a new species to the game, and view it as the starting point for BOTW... no it must just all be a crazy easter egg.

You know what's an easter egg? Finding the skyward sword art in OOT 3D. This is a stone mural. They're trying to make it fit in.
"
31238,"the...costume?
"
31425,"Saying that the sea went away and they just came back to Hyrule is a massive leap compared to ""they added some art in the HD port to suggest that this species exists here too""

Going back to Hyrule defeat the entire point of Wind Waker's ending.

Okay seriously, you acting like I'm ""dismissing"" your points, when you're saying ""what if after wind waker the sea drained, they went back to hyrule, the sheikah zora and gerudo all came back, and hyrule just continued as normal"" vs my saying ""they added rito to tphd, suggesting that rito are a thing in the TP timeline""? You're dismissing a WHOLE lot more than I am
"
31537,"Well, he's frozen in stone and trapped beneath Hyrule, but he always seems to come back. His neck snapped in Twilight Princess but even assuming BOTW isn't part of that timeline, he was reincarnated in Four Sword Adventures. That said, he doesn't come back in PH or ST, and the whole point of Wind Waker is moving on from the past, so I doubt he'd come back
"
32674,"yes, clearly the there's something wrong because people are literally turning in fanfic to me to counter actual evidence

and now all you've brought to the table is the most nothing statement you possibly could. Excellent counter point. Well done
"
35005,"okay, nut job
"
38819,"Yes, however there are two things. One, the Japanese version DOES say Twilight, and apparently it's the same word used for Twilight as Midna's title in Twilight Princess. The other thing is that only Skyward Time and Twilight are mentioned in the sentence where Zelda is talking about people who used the Master sword. The later references ""the sea of time and distance"" and ""the golden power"" are a lot more vague (following the other references she should have said something with ""wind"" or ""waker"" and the ""golden power"" is a super common way to refer to the triforce) and aren't connected to a sentence about the Master Sword.

EDIT: I've just been told the Japanese version doesn't have any references to Wind Waker even slightly, so that's that I guess
"
39054,"yeah, it's a big maybe for sure. I'd just argue that theEnglish version will holds more water than, say, the German version
"
40525,"Even if the Twilight Realm is a thing elsewhere, it's only relevant to the Master Sword in Twilight Princess, as far as we know. And Zelda is talking about the Master Sword's connection with heroes.

The German and Frenhc versions apparently mention Wind Waker stuff, and every language has a soft alttp reference in the form of ""the golden power""

However the Japanese version ONLY has the skyward, time and twilight references, and a very light alttp reference.

Now, the Ruto references suggest the Adult Timeline most easily, however BOTW really doesn't work as a Wind Waker sequel. The Zora aren't a thing in the Adult timeline, and they LEAVE Hyrule behind. A lot of stuff has to happen for that to work.

So from there you have to assume that Ruto awakens as a sage no matter what, or at least that it comes to pass in the Child or Downfall timelines. It's worth noting that there's a water sage in Twilight Princess, who Ganondorf kills, but it isn't replaced. Another couple of tidbits about the Zora monument. One, they don't refer to the Hero as ""The Hero of Time"" but rather the ""Hero of Legend"". They also say that there was a man who had ""designs on ruling the world"" in other words it implies that it's not the Ocarina of Time world where he succeeds.

Now there's a lot of weirdness in the Downfall timeline, but a big one is that a lot of Zora go feral, and there are no instances of the oracina of time styled Zora appearing. Additionally, the Downfall timeline requires that Link fail, or die, or something, so it's not very likely that Ruto, even if she awakened as a Sage, would be fighting alongside any Hero of Legend.

One final bit is that they could simply be referring to Child Link's actions in helping Zora's Domain in Ocarina of Time. They do draw attention to the fact that Ruto was he attendant of their patron deity.

It's the other timelines not really fitting, alongside the Twilight line, PLUS Twilight Princess HD adding carvings depicting Rito, AND the Arbiter's Grounds appearing that, all together make me think the Child Timeline is the most likely.
"
40548,"It's a pretty strong indicator, at least.
"
40598,"Maybe, but that doesn't seem likely to me since the game very clearly is building off of Skyward Sword.
"
41374,"Twilight Princess isn't open world at all.

And I don't mean graphics no. Skyward Sword is clearly a test for BOTW's mechanics. The stamina metre, Hero Mode with its not dropping hearts. The sailcloth was even in early versions. The way you catch bugs, the crafting of items and potions in general. BOTW is mechanically very similar to Skyward Sword, despite being structurally nothing like it.

Anyways, that quote paired with the new stone carvings depicting Rito add some significance
"
43145,"She wouldn't be the awakened as a sage int he downfall or child timelines, but BOTW CAN'T realistically be in the Adult timeline.

I may be wrong about this, but wouldn't the problems child link solves still exist after that though? He'd have to go and help the zora and gorons again, or something. In fact that could tie into why there's a ""hero of legend"" rather than a ""hero of time"". Especially since the Hero's Shade clearly went on to fight more battles or SOMETHING, going by his armour and sword techniques.

Oh and obviously the Arbiter's Grounds exists in all the timelines, it seems silly to suggest they build a gaitn temple in the Gerudo Desert just to execute Ganondorf. It's just that TP s the only game where it's shown, so its continued existence is a a reference to that game, in the same way that if a game were to reference Labrynna explicitly that's sooner a reference to Oracle of Ages than it is a suggestion that it's Labrynna from another timeline

Like, here's the thing. Since I really don't think t fits in the adult timeline, I have a much easier time assuming something happened with child link and ruto after the fact than something happening to fit in the Downfall timeline, that's all
"
43494,"The structure is more like Wind Waker or Skyward Sword. Wind Waker in its open-ness, or skyward sword in its actual game design. TP's map is just big, it's not really designed like BOTW at all

Skyward Sword introduced Hero Mode, it being added to later HD ports and ALBW doesn't change the fact that it originated in Skyward Sword. TP had 24 bugs to catch for a specific reward, BOTW has catching bugs specifically for crafting potions, just like in Skyward Sword. The stamina gauge works just like in Skyward Sword, not like in Skyrim or any other game off the top of my head. They even said in some interview that BOTW is the evolved form of Skyward Sword. Meanwhile, the HD port of TP certainly doesn't feel like the starting point of BOTW to me at all, UNLESS he meant lore.
"
43612,"apparently those slight references to WW and ALTTP aren't in the Japanese text at all. Even then, Zelda's sentence clearly ends. She's talking about heroes with a connection to the Master Sword, and says ""Skyward"" ""Time"" and ""Twilight"" and then stops. The other references come later, and are a lot less direct, in English, and don't even exist, apparently, in the Japanese version
"
46616,"oh wow I totally forgot about those Zora

the bird thing... I'm less inclined to believe. We know that Rito evolved from Zora. Though that said, it's safe to say that that just happens no matter what at some point.

last I heard there's no confirmed moment that Link fails in the downfall timeline.

I'm not sure what you mean with that last bit about Rauru Town

in this thread a person has been posting translations. It's super long so sorry but I'm not gonna dig through it again to find specifics. It's an interesting read though

I didn't think about Link not pulling the sword... man oot's ending is weird. I wish we knew more about what stayed and what didn't.
"
47178,"the thing is that as heavily as it suggests the adult timeline, it doesn't work because of Wind Waker, it'd take a huge amount of unknown things happening to make it work.

that can't be an accurate summary of the post ending events of OOT because Link needs to confirm what Ganondorf is planning so that he gets executed

Well we don't ACTUALLY know that Aribter's Grounds exists in the other timelines, that's an assumption, and I stand by that it makes a stronger case to be a reference to the game it originated from than another timeline where it's never referenced

it doesn't fit snugly into any timeline but frankly there are a million excuses that can be made to work around ANY of them. If Aunoma says one timeline or another then you just kinda have to assume stuff happened that makes it match up. Like if he says Child Timeline it means Ruto still becomes a sage, if he says Adult then at some point the Great Sea drains and they leaves New Hyrule to return to Old Hyrule, and all the missing races come back.

Honestly I don't really like timeline unification, especially because I like the direction the Adult timeline goes, and undoing that undermines the entire point of Wind Waker
"
48002,"doesn't strike me as gameplay as all. They ask for a message about things forward to in the game, and he says it's the ""origin point"" for the game they're working on, and that people playing it will see things and say ""oh I see!""

that doesn't feel like gameplay talk to me, that strikes me as making connections. Seeing stuff in TPHD and connecting it to BOTW. The only thing the HD port added in terms of gameplay that matches up with BOTW is the new horseback controls. But in terms of lore they added Rito, which is a WEIRD thing to add as an ""easter egg""
"
52120,"You think he's saying that Twilight Princess... is the origin point for Twilight Princess HD?

he literally says ""when I look at this remake, I feel like this is the origin point of the new title we're making now""
"
59610,"but wind waker literally doesn't allow for more Hyrule stories

it's also worth mentioning they say the man had ""designs"" on ruling the world, which doesn't fit with the adult timeline where he had already won
"
60554,"I've been workshopping the dea of a new timeline split but I'm just not sure how to make it work cleanly.

With the ST map, I'm noticing a lack of a giant desert for one, and honestly Zelda maps are pretty much always structured like that. Though the biggest thing is that pretty much eveyr landmakr in BOTW is named after something from another game,a dn it's still comprised of the Lanayru Eldin and Faron regions, as well as places like Hebra from alttp."
60786,"Returning to Hyrule undermines the entire point of Wind Waker. Also, Rito show up in Wind Waker, but it's actually stated they evolved from Zora. For a long time people assumed they simply replaced the Zora, like a pokemon evolution, but I think it's more likely that Zora died out. Some Wind Waker NPCs mention that the Great Sea is barren, there's a sugegstion that there's a curse on the water to prevent people from finding Old Hyrule, which Zora would be able to do easily. In BOTW Zora and Rito exist, so it pretty clearly shows that Rito and Zora can coexist. Whether that means the Zora somehow survived after Wind Waker and resurface much later, or the Rito were always going to evolve from the Zora, I guess we don't know 100%
"
61023,"Yeah, there's obviously that infamous ""Game Over Return of Ganon"" game over screen in Zelda 2, and in the Oracle games Kotake and Koume are trying to revive Ganon

In the same way people don't notice that it's the same Link in the majority of the downfall timeline games, people don't notice it's largely the same Ganon. He's explicitly reincarnated as a Gerudo in Four Sword Adventures, but that's about it. Calamity Ganon bears a resemblance to Twilight Princess Ganon, so it could even be that THAT is still the same Ganon.
"
62916,"And there's no room in the Wind Waker timeline for another Hyrule story.

Besides, they awaken as sages, it's not that they would never be sages. Also, people keep attributing Medoh to Medli, but I read it as Mido. For no discernable reason Mido becomes important after OOT. There's a town named after him in Zelda 2
"
63349,"oh did that get changed? that sucks, I liked it just being one story

what's the book?
"
63758,"huh, reading into it now, there's some very damning the encyclopedia reveals about Wind Waker, apparently the King's wish... destroyed the triforce. That throws a wrench in some things
"
65026,"well, it seems there's some pretty damning evidnece in the 30th anniversary book, the Zelda Encyclopedia.

During the ending of Wind Waker the triforce is destroyed. So. yeah. Nothing really works after that.
"
65208,"Got some new information from the 30th anniversary book ""Zelda Encyclopedia""

At the end of Wind Waker the triforce is destroyed, apparently, so that rules out any traditional Zelda stories after Wind Waker.

In the Downfall timeline the Zora become wild river zora, the only instance of traditional zora is in oracle of ages, which isn't set in hyrule.

so yeah, that changes some things
"
65308,"reading up the the 30th anniversary book The Zelda encyclopedia, I was reminded of something. The Downfall timeline only has normal Zora in labrynna, in hyrule they're always river zora, which the book describes as wild
"
65409,"okay so according to the Zelda Encyclopedia, the 30th anniversary book, not only does Ganondorf die in Wind Waker... the triforce is destroyed.

So yeah, that's pretty damning
"
69852,"yeah. The Hyrule Encyclopedia actually says it was because the Great Sea had no fish, so it couldn't support Zora life

there's an interesting bit of lore I forgot about, how Rito in Wind Waker need Valoo to get their wings. That's not the case in BOTW, so it suggests that in Wind Waker it's less natural, more forced
