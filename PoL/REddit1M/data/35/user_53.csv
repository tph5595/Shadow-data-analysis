34843,"In Central Hyrule, southeast from Hyrule Castle.  The area is rife with Guardians, so it's a somewhat difficult area to explore, but you shouldn't have much trouble reaching it if you travel west from Lanayru Region. 

Although it's never stated to be Lon Lon Ranch, the overall layout is nearly identical, although obviously destroyed because of its proximity to Hyrule Castle."
