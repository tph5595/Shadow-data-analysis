32412,"They've really moved away from the three Goddesses lately.  Twilight Princess only really references them, and doesn't really name them outright, and then Skyward Sword focuses entirely on Hylia, and BotW only mentiones Hylia as well.

There's that trend running alongside the growing visual trend since Wind Waker of ""the Goddesses ancient magic is actually technology""."
32646,"The problem is that the Koroks in BotW heavily reference the Hero of Time and his relationship to the Kokiri.

The trials being about growing up, for example, and the design of the trials and their reference to Links early tasks before leaving Kokiri Forest."
33574,"The Koroks in WW definitely don't make such explicit comparisons, but at the time they didn't need to since the connection to the Kokiri was obvious.

I think your order is way over-complicated.  The flooded timeline is its own separate thing, designed to allow for a subset of games set in a different world.  There's no need or reason for it for it to be unflooded, and it's a bit much to suggest that something like the same Lon-Lon Ranch, or the Temple in this post, is still recognisable after the sudden flood at the end of WW when the protection collapses, then thousands of years of the water draining (?) etc. 

Whereas I don't see it as a particularly difficult leap that it's a different, non-flooded timeline where the Koroks changed form for some other reason.  They're obviously the same thing, just arrived at in two different ways. 

Might just be personal preference on what's easier to believe or not.

There's also one other assumption that a lot of people are making, and that's that the minimum 10,000 year gap that had to have been after a given title, which isn't the case at all.  The Guardians were only unearthed 100 years before BotW.  They'd only just recently been discovered.

I'm not saying it's the case, just that it's silly to rule it out, but 100 years before BotW could have been something like 80 years after OoT.  Really the only minimum time gap is that it can't be the same Princess Zelda, if you want to accept the idea that the Rito were always around but we just never encountered them.  Time enough to learn for the first time about the Guardians from 10,000 years ago.

34065,"&gt;  She was not a sage in the child timeline.

Yet.

She was awakened by Link as an adult, but just because the game took us back to the point in the child timeline before she was awakened, that doesn't mean she was never awakened.

"
34268,"&gt; Given that it's referencing when the beast was built, not recovered, that would indicate a huge amount of time between Ocarina and BotW.

Is it though?  I could well be completely wrong but I don't recall any explicit mention of *who* named the Beasts after the Sages.  By way of example... I could dig up an old Roman sword and name it after my Grandfather.

And agreed, it doesn't matter, but there's something attractive about trying to nut it all out."
34326,"Where's the rule that says Sages only exist to fight Ganon?

Rauru was awakened already.  There were Sages ready to seal Ganondorf in the flashbacks of TP."
34829,"I'm just wondering how they'd know the names if they'd never even heard of them before they were discovered.  

Although presumably the story/legend about them that they discovered would have the names, and now I think of it... the names do sound very Shheikah, similar to the names of the Monks in the Shrines."
34931,"If this is a prophecy then the whole thing is moot. 

&gt;""When evil rules all, an awakening voice from the Sacred Realm will call those destined to be Sages

Those who are destined to be Sages were always / are already destined to be Sages.  When evil rules all they will be awakened, but if it's a prophecy, not a condition, that doesn't mean they cant be awakened by other means for other reasons."
35071,"Could well be, in fact that rings a few bells regarding some dialogue about them here and there in the game."
38747,"Sure, but previously all worship and general gods talk always brought them up, and that has stopped happening."
39357,"I mean people relaying stories about them and the creation myth. I'd forgotten about the light spirits, good catch, that's contradicting what I'm saying a bit about TP."
58609,I think you may be right.
