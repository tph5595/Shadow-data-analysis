38546,"Regarding the last bit of what you have spoilered... [The birthplace of Hyrule is the ForgottenTemple in BotW, a location found embedded into a canyon between the Hebra region and Hyrule Castle. Not only is the largest Goddess Statue found here, in-game text refers to it as the oldest statue. The Temple of Time in BotW is another new one.](/spoiler)"
39504,"Well, I didn't mention it because it's a spoiler within a spoiler, buuut... [After you complete all of the shrines you'll get a quest called ""A Gift from the Monks."" The text is in the quest log before you claim the gift.](/spoiler) I took [a screen](http://i.imgur.com/a7HiQBy.jpg) of it."

Alternatively, the old man also could just be wrong I suppose, since the place I mentioned is, y'know, [called the 'Forgotten' Temple](/spoiler). "
