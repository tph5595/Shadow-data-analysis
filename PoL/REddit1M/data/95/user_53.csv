26011,"I saw an interview between Aonuma and Jirard The Completionist recently. 

When Jirard said that he could tell that it was going to be tough to complete BoTW Aonuma looked him dead in the face and said:
 ""You will not be able to complete this game."" 

Jirard just gave an ""Oh shit did he just say that?"" Look.

I know they're mostly just trying to hype up their game but I have never heard a dev flat out tell a person ""You will not complete this game."" And he said that to The Completionist of all people!"
