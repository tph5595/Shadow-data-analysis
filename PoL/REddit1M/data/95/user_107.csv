43323,"The fact that there is DLC for this doesn't really bother me. The season pass is pretty cheap compared to most games, and the DLC is an afterthought, not something left out of the game at its release. 

It's kinda weird that they're making us pay for a difficulty mode? Then again, Master Quest was essentially the same deal.

I'm pretty excited to play this game, and I'll definitely look in to the DLC too, it could be worth it. I think the bitching is unwarranted. "
