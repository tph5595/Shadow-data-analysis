47963,"wait why is supporting nintendo ""being levelheaded""?

being levelheaded here would be acknowledging that this has a bunch of negative implications but due to the vagueness could easily be nothing, or even a good thing.

48009,"white knighting is commonly associated with women, but it's a general term for anybody who goes out of their way to defend something to an unreasonable degree
"
48043,"nintendo became EA the moment they charged 60 bucks for Fire Emblem Awakening's DLC
"
48071,"well it's kinda weird because... you can't currently buy the DLC separately
"
48307,"Nintendo has been as bad as EA in several scenarios. Or, in some cases a more accurate comparison is activison.

The DLC for both Fire Emblem Awakening and Smash for Wii U and 3DS cost more than their actual games. They lock content behind super expensive and artificially limited amiibos. They refuse to lower their prices outside of a special selects program, and pull all kinds of stuff like making people rebuy virtual console games, charging extra to get DLC for both versions of smash, and all sorts of stuff I can't be bothered to list.


"
48386,"the content being crap doesn't justify the fact that they locked so much of it behind an amiibo. If people keep letting that happen enxt thing you know we're gonna get story bits and dungeons locked behind amiibo

"
48475,"charging full price for an HD port of a decade old game where a chunk of the new content is locked behind an amiibo? EA WISHES it could get away with that
"
48538,"what incomplete games does EA release

for that matter, Nintendo has released games with on disk content several times now
"
48608,"It did on the initial run. Now they're sold separately. It also obviously doesn't come with any used or digital copies
"
48632,"very little is ""essential"" for a game

cutting it and locking it away still isn't good
"
48737,"better be an amazing ass dungeon and story if it costs 1/3 of the full game
"
48895,"nintendo does that with amiibos all the time
"
48923,"why is this downvoted
"
49134,"fire emblem heroes plays into a common japanese mobile genre known as ""gatcha""

basically what they do is have players use items to get a random chance at some item. This is almost always an iconic character of some sort, for example in FEH it's classic Fire Emblem characters. These games are always designed to be generous and easy at the start, to build good will with players, then they grow more insidious as time goes on and they nudge the player into buying the microtransactions to get the characters/items/whatever they need to keep progressing in the game.

Basically, they're very manipulative cash grabs that hide behind a bunch of spectacle and fanservice to milk some money out of fans
"
49369,"master quest is more difficult, however difficulty modes in eveyr recent Zelda have been hero mode... which doesn't even come close
"
49416,"there are different levels of arbitrary. A well designed game wouldn't have you notice how arbitrary it is
"
49466,"Skyward Sword was also linear as heck.

BOTW is confirmed to have just below 100 side quests, which, to compare, is more than there were in Majora's Mask, a game about side quests
"
49532,"usually it's stated before or simultaneously that you can get them separately.
"
49581,"when mario kart 8's DLC was revealed the price for each pack was also shown. Same with Hyrule Warriors
"
75003,"I haven't

so tell me
"
75071,"all of the DLC together costs 60
"
75111,"what makes batlefront incomplete?

having extra maps after launch?
"
84465,"that's not a thing that happened though, unless you're talking about the free episode 7 map they gave out?
"
95112,"but it was still 60 dollars for for a game that literally only cost 40
