21426,"He was talking about twilight princess btw.

Which is a 100% full game without the wolf link amiibo. 

So ""some of the amiibo locked content comes pretty close to EA"" is completely false."
23388,"What?

Ea realeases incomplete game but with all the features on the disk.

Day 1 you pay half the price of the game to get the rest of the game (this stuff was already finished)

Nintendo realeases complete game 

10 years later they release something that's cheaper than EA's DLC 

For that price you get a collectible and some fun bonus content that's not essential to the game 




How the fuck is that worse?"
24156,"But I was talking about TP.

Also BOTW DLC is in development and releases in 9 months (the substantial stuff). So it's not day one DLC that was taken out of the full game.  The hard mode might be a rip off but we don't know enough about it to call it one yet.

Smash was overpriced but it wasn't pay2win.  That's just how smash works new characters are always laughably unbalanced and then through a number of free patches they get buffed and nerfed (as cloud and bayo have)

I haven't bought a single amiibo I don't think they're worth my money.  But the amiibos are mostly collectibles not DLC.  They usually add super trivial things to games.  The one in question you ordered online if you wanted the physical copy of TPHD.  If you didn't get you didn't lose anything.  Also BOTW DLC is digital.  I also won't be buying it til after December of when it gets reviewed


Edit: Also smash was a full game without the DLC "
28546,"Was it not a 100% full game back in 2006 when even the concept of amiibo's didn't even exist?






Does not having 1 single weapon really hurt the experience of the game?  Also 1 weapon isn't removing essential elements like EA does"

67343,"Battlefront was incomplete, and it cost 120 to get the full game (buying the game + 60 dollars of DLC)

Twilight Princess HD is less than 60 dollars and comes with a collectible and the supposed locked content when you buy it.


It regularly goes on sale on the eshop as well 


&gt; for that matter, Nintendo has released games with on disk content several times now

What games?"
83043,"No it's having to pay for maps that were completed before launch that were taken out of the game.

&gt;&gt;for that matter, Nintendo has released games with on disk content several times now

&gt;What games?"
84762,"Hmm yeah, looks I got caught caught up in the fuck EA reddit circlejerk that was going on during the release of that game.

So I guess I agree with you that EA doesn't really do that cause I can't think of any other example

But still
