66131,"Right? Literally the only reason they are doing MK8Deluxe instead if MK9 right now on the switch, is because I'm sure the game developers weren't prepared for such a (relatively) early Switch launch. So to give them more time to work on MK9, they just bundled everything together to satisfy that MK itch people get. 

I doubt they will end up doing this for BotW, more than any reason just because they'd have no reason to, because I doubt it will be ported to their next system. "
