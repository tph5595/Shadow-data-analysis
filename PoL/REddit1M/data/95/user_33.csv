20596,"Mostly it has been people being iffy about the vagueness behind the DLC, and then white knights yelling at people for daring to question Nintendo"
48629,Did you just assume Nintendo's gender ?
48664,"on the internet, pretty much yeah"
48837,"You think this heart attack is gonna form itself ?  
What else should I be yelling at !"
69658,"You assume this.  
you don't actually have anymore proof (especially so atm) than anyone saying it is content that was removed has.  

I don't believe it to be myself, but don't pretend like it is in anyway a confirmed fact"
71379,"Offcourse they wouldn't come out and fucking say it if some of this stuff was cut content...  

Like I said, I don't believe it is, but you do realize there is such a thing as lying/embellishing the truth right?

&gt;
That being said, Nintendo has had a good track record when it comes to DLC. Their previous stuff was not cut content.   

Their previous stuff also wasn't very vaguely spoken about and announced before release.  

&gt;We just have to wait and see since we don't know yet.  

And saying to be wary of this sort of practices' potential for going downhill is exactly the way to be ""patient""  
None of those ""bad companies"" started rotten the core either, it is a gradual process as they realize they get away with more and more.  

The point of people warning to be wary of this stuff, is to not allow Nintendo to even start dipping their toe into the potential for ""corruption"""

Just polishing these e-cards before spending them on quality Nintendo^^tm products!"
74861,"&gt;  you asked for evidence to support why it's more likely its extra content rather than cut content 

I did not ASK for any such thing.  
I said there was no evidence for either side.  
and there isn't.  

the stuff you gave isn't ""evidence""  
it doesn't PROOF this isn't cut content, it just makes it more likely.  

And yes, before you say it : it is practically impossble to actually ""proof"" it isn't, which is why I didn't ASK for it in the first place."
