130902,"i'm sure its not lets get real its a business and they are around to make money they aren't waiting till the game is out to work on dlc they dont just come up with the idea over night and decide to tell the world.


Hard mode...defiantly waited till after the game is out to add a switch to make the game more difficult.  


 just realized i'm in a zelda sub not going to win any arguments here 
"

167738,I speak facts you cant deny that you are getting dlc before a game is released just like every game people cry about facts cant argue the truth its that simple people just like to pick and choose what to cry about.
