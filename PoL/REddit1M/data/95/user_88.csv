35766,"I think I am maybe just mad that this is the norm now in games. When I used to play NINTENDO back in the day, I would spend my hard earned allowance and buy THE GAME. Now I have to spend more to get THE GAME. I don't see it as additional content. Additional content was always something you EARN when you got really good at the game. Not when you give them more money. Great business model for the company, terrible for the consumer. "
