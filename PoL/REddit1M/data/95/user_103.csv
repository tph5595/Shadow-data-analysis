40324,"People are up in arms when a game has content removed specifically to be DLC. This DLC hasn't been made yet from my understanding, so it's not reducing the story. "

&gt;aren't waiting till the game is out to work on DLC

They are, after all, as you said, a business, so there's is a compartmentalization of labor. The storyboard developers have probably been working on DLC, because they would have finished their work on the main game months ago. The coders and debuggers work to ensure the game an optimized for playing conditioning; the game just went gold a week ago if I recall correctly, so they would not have had time to work on optimizing any DLC. 

&gt;hard mode

We know nothing about what this is. *Hero mode*, the traditional ""hard mode"" in the last few incarnations of Zelda, but been included from the onset and likely will be again, which suggests this new hard mode (it's even called ""new"" hard mode) could be something more akin to Master Quest, which changes dungeon and map design, enemy spawns, and a whole slew of other in game designs. 

Nintendo has never been known to send incomplete games where they hold back story for the sole purpose of making DLC, except in the case of Splatoon. All of their DLC, while planned from the onset of development (see Fire Emblem: Awakening and Fates, Hyrule Warriors), or they've developed it towards the end of the game when only debugging is left, or after the game has come out (see Mario Kart 8, Smash Bros). In the case of Splatoon, the campaign was very much completed, but the online multiplayer was gimped initially to draw players in and continue to provide them with sustenance as more weapons and maps were released over the first few months. All that also came in free patches. 

Meanwhile look at Ubisoft or EA, who are the antithesis to good DLC practice, and you'll see examples like Battlefront, Battlefield, and more, where key content is held off for season passes and in some cases can even be used in a pay-to-win scenario.

*Definitely*"

193756,"Is it impossible for you to string a simple sentence together? We have been told about DLC before the game comes out. Sure, but there is zero indication Nintendo has gimped the game for this DLC, that there was development of this DLC significantly prior to the announcement, or that the game we are receiving is in anyway incomplete. People don't bitch about DLC, they bitch about companies like EA shipping an incomplete game and having the remaining portion being locked behind DLC. Nintendo has never done this, and there's no indication that they have here. If you're trying to argue otherwise you're not stating facts, you're fear mongering. "
218221,The only fact is there's DLC for Zelda that has been announced prior to release. Nothing else you've said is a fact. You're not bright.
