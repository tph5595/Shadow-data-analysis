78004,"Honestly, I think that Nintendo is the only one getting DLC right ATM. They're not EA or Ubisoft, guys. Remember Hyrule Warriors? That has tons of DLC but none of it is super expensive, they add a lot of cool things, and the base game has hours and hours of content to begin with. Breath of The Wild will be fine with DLC. "
