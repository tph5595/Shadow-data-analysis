68853,"This is really just my way of looking at it, but I'd like to think the content that will be DLC just wouldn't have existed if this game came out back in the day. If downloadable content didn't exist then the stuff that's being offered wouldn't either. 

This only applies to DLC that's not on the disc or available on day one though (and I'm not counting the treasure chests)."
