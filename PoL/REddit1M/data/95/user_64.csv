28742,"$20 season pass announced for BoTW, 3 chests appear in the plateau upon purchase: exclusive Switch shirt and 2 ""useful items"". DLC 1 won't be much, just a ""hard mode"" and a few minor things I can't remember, but DLC 2 next winter will have a full, entirely new story. Available for prepurchase on release day, I think.

Needless to say, I'll be broke after March 3 ^^no ^^ragrets"
