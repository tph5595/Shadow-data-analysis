But damn is it gonna be a bitch for me to 100% this game. I've done all of them before this without guides... I think this might be the first Zelda to beat me in that aspect."

When we got in in 2007 I had already finished twilight princess. I've never felt the desire to use guides. I've just kept playing and playing as playing."

I miss having the time I did as a kid. Probably wouldn't be able to now. It just comes from not being able to afford many games so I just kept playing Zelda. :p"
