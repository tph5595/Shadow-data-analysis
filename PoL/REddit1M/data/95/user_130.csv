It's also worth mentioning that there's something of a grey area between third and first party devs, a ""2nd party"". Something like GameFreak has a different relationship with Nintendo than Capcom, Koei, or Konami, and Retro is outright a (first party) division of Nintendo. GF is a joint player in the Pokemon Company; imagine if GF were bought by Microsoft or Sony and the headache with figuring out who owns what then.

That happened to Rare and Nintendo is interested in protecting their properties generally. 

(Smash gets away with it because it's clear who owns what ahead of time and it's kind of like the game is renting the properties, not staking a claim to owning anything in the properties)."
