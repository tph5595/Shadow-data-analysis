22582,"What? The base game has gone gold. It already has more content than every previous Zelda (which in my opinion were all *light* on content unless you really love collecting arbitrary things). All of the DLC is being concept drafted *right now*. It's all after thought stuff. As in, quests and features that weren't even going to be in the base game. I *prefer* developers to spend time making content for a game after they finish it at its base. I like having things to do months later after I beat the game, rather than just having the game become a memory after completion. "
32047,You're assuming that there aren't true sidequests that revolve around separate storylines and people. Not every sidequest will be a stupid fetch/loot quest. Skyward Sword did a good job on emphasising npc character growth.
