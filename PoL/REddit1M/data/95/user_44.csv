&gt;on-disc content locked behind a **physical** dlc paywall "
23754,"Well apparently it's not complete because they're trying to sell us the hard difficulty that should be included, and a map feature that sounds like it should be a patch. Forcing us to buy extra crap that we don't want. Smash dlc was ridiculously overpriced and contained rigged and overpowered characters(fucking Beyonetta), turning it into a pay2win game. At least EA gives you the option to buy dlc digitally, instead of forcing you to go out and look for a dumb amiibo. Don't be an apologist. "
