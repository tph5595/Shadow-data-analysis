73593,"Was thinking of siege as well.  I actually picked up season 2 as part of a complete edition.  Already had it on xb1 disc, but was able to get the digital version, throw a little support to keep the game going, and give the disc game to a friend who is about to purchase an xb1.

That being said, I never really felt like I needed to spend money, as you can unlock via points... I suppose in season 2 I'll just have more skins."

I am somewhat torn on DLC.  I must admit I am generally not as much a fan of it when it is done on single player games... if it is episodic, I get it, but you need to make sure it is a complete game.  I mean I can imagine LOZ:alttp where you pay for the first half of the game, then dlc is the dark world.  Ya both would be ok games, but I certainly wouldn't have had the nostalgia for it like I do as having it as a full game... idk... hopefully the dlc doesn't take people out of the experience... but at the same time, if you are going to do it, make it substantial.  To me I wouldn't mind seeing an engine make 2 games like MM and OoT.  If MM is labeled ""DLC"" I am definitely ok with that strategy... anyway, here's hoping it is done right for BotW, sad when you need to start considering waiting for the GotY edition when the game isn't even out yet."
