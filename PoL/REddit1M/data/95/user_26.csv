I agree that Nintendo is ethical when it comes to DLC, but it seems they are hedging their bets by announcing this prior to release. I hope it's great. They know this is their biggest game in years so I see why they are doing it."

23992,"It seems they are going with Sakurai's method of DLC (which I agree with) where you don't develop the DLC until after the game comes out. It just seems a bit shady to me that there isn't much data or info they gave us for an the investment on day 1. I'm just playing the side of the picky consumer.  

Edit: Sakurai autocorrect, lol "
25437,"That's a good argument. The thing that bothers me is I hate missing out on things, even if it is a mere three chests. I'm a big Zelda fan, so I have confidence in the second pack, I'm just a bit apprehensive at the moment. Surely that is understandable to the rest of you."
54331,Well it had cave of ordeals and the cave of trials and didn't all the copies come with the amiibo?
