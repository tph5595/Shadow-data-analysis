100281,Unpopular opinion but I don't mind the DLC. This is Nintendo not EA or Activision.  Super Mario U had a DLC and it was a full game. Smash and Mario kart also had awesome DLC.  Plus a season pass depending on what kind of DLC is being made gives us more Zelda to play!  That's something that only comes around every few years.  I mean it's been 6 years since skyward sword.
