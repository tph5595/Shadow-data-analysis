13447,"What bugs me (from what I heard) is that you can only buy all of the DLC, and it comes with some things I definitely wouldn't want to pay for (like a Switch T-shirt for Link), so it'd be nice if game content was sold separately from cosmetic stuff. 

EDIT: [Based on this image](https://i.imgur.com/XhnlFaQ.jpg) I'm only interested in part of DLC pack 2, out of all of this stuff, so I should be able to just spend like $9 on the content I want, instead of having to throw another $20 at them, for stuff I'm going to likely just ignore. Nintendo always does things that are *almost* right. "

And knowing Nintendo's track record for trying to do something right and then doing some stupid thing that makes it not as good as it could be, doesn't help. Like how the switch will do chat and matchmaking. "
