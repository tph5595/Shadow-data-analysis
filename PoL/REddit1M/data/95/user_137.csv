63181,"This is most definitely my Nintendo bias speaking, but i feel so much better buying their DLC than say, oh i dunno.... EA. The guys who made a really cool looking Star Wars game with great graphics, sold it for $60 only for you to find out it was half finished and they were gonna sell me the other half for $50, yeah that EA. 

This is a finished game, or it should be after all the time they took making it and being extra anal about it the only way Nintendo can. Im more inclined to buy DLC for a finished game because i dont NEED ir to feel like im not missing out on a full game. Plus, its only $20 for several different exclusive items and clothes, an eventual new hard mode and challenge dungeon, AND an entire new story edition. I say that's more than worth it, they could've easily charged $10 each for all three DLCs.
