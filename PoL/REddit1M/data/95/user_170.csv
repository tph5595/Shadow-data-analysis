I don't believe that you've 100%'d them all without a guide if you say TP was the hardest one.  It's *by far* the easiest to 100% because it literally shows you where every heart-piece is and every other collectible glows.  TP is basically the King of Easy in all aspects when compared to the rest of the series, even if you're just counting the 3D games."
