It was on-disc content locked behind a physical dlc paywall that would've been a lot worse if it didn't come with the physical copy of the game."

27529,"Yeah, I mentioned that in my post. In the US at least, it came with the physical version, not sure about the rest of the world"
27747,Crappy locked content is still locked content and it sets a precedent. It just makes me worried about nintendo potentially locking more meaningful content behind amiibo in breath of the wild and other future titles.
28127,"It's not a 100% full game without the amiibo though, more like a 99% full game. Like I said there's no way to get the largest wallet or access the dungeon without it and it was content on the disk at release. Maybe its not the best example of amiibo locked content, but its the worst one that I've had experience with. I think I read somewhere that splatoon had challenges that required amiibo and hyrule warriors had a weapon that needed an amiibo, but I haven't played them."
29601,"Well obviously it's 100% of the original game, but tphd is a remaster with additional content so it's not 100% of tphd. Additional content in remasters should be an incentive to buy the remaster, not to buy additional dlc for it. 
  
Missing 1 item doesn't hurt the the experience of the game if you're just playing the main game, but for people who want to get 100% completion, it does hurt the experience. Clearly it's not essential elements, but EA didn't start their shitty dlc practices by removing essential elements either and it makes me worry about having more meaningful/essential content locked behind amiibo in future nintendo titles."

Amiibo started off with smash that just had an interesting new ai and better incorporation of the actual figure, but more recently they have mostly been just locking skins and items behind them. I can see nintendo locking levels or characters behind amiibo in the future, but I hope it doesn't come to that or they let us buy the additional content digitally as well."
