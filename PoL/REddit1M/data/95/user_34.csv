20749,I'm assuming the vagueness will be cleared up post release. Probably not revealing the names of the expansion and stuff so as not to give away any more plot details.
20824,Nothing to spend your money on has ALWAYS been a flaw in Twilight Princess. 
20931,To be fair...the article author was probably running with the same information we all have.
21003,"&gt; Had Indian food last night? Maybe I'll do another shrine

Never poop without Zelda again!"
21134,"&gt; The DLC available at launch is very lackluster and should be in the base game.

You mean... the 3 extra chests? 

Yeah....thats hardly DLC. Its not even meant to be something to push people to buy. Its just a bonus for people who pick up the pass. Thats it."
21732,"Thats essentially the only thing. Get tons of Rupees, Don Magic Armor, Beat Cave of Trials, See topless fairy lady, Profit?"
23703,"Why? My comment was pointing out that there really isn't ""launch DLC"".

Although...I will admit I am curious as to what ""Additional Map Feature"" is."
23805,"Essentially... but also... not... since you don't need to ""pre-order"" it. 

I assume anyone who buys the pass once we get more details will still get...all 3 chests."
24719,"I agree it's pretty vague. 

But then I started thinking about possible ""Why"" reasons and the one that I settled on was ""They probably don't want more details coming out about expanded content before launch because dungeon names or new adventure titles may hint off as to currently unreleased information about the main game."" 

I assume they'll release more information about all this after launch. 

Currently... fingers crossed for ""All Tingle Adventure DLC Extravaganza"".... but its probably something like ""Play this new adventure as Princess Zelda as she fights off evil to ensure Link's safety!!!!"" or something... and they just don't want that getting out until the actual game is being played.

That being said... NONE OF THIS answers the pressing question of ""What does 'Additional Map Feature' mean?""!!! 

"
26558,"Oh I get it. I'm big on the franchise. 

I just figure the 3 chests are likely ""stronger versions"" of the normal items. "
