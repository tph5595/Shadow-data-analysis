41068,"I forget Capcom made those games... That reminds me...why doesn't nintendo let other companies do some more with there IPs? 

Rare did Donkey Kong/Star Fox Adventures 
Retro with Metroid prime/DK Country 
Team Ninja with Other M
Bandai Namco with Smash 4 
Capcom with These games 

That's all I can think of really

82439,It's a guilty pleasure for me. Like every time I play it I'm like dam...so this is what caused rare to sell out to Microsoft 
110936,"So could nintendo technically still make a Banjo game for handheld consoles? I heard something about Microsoft still being able to make money from them(as there was Diddy Kong racing DS,Banjo Gruntildas Revenge and Banjo Pilots I believe which came out after Microsoft bought them out) So I wonder why Nintendo doesn't buy Playtonic Games(Although I don't think anyone there would want anything to do with a nintendo ever again) "
