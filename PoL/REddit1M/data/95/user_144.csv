66613,Are we really going to complain that they haven't yet reached the industry standard for ten years then complain again when they make strides towards it?
69314,it's irrelevant whether it's good or bad.. we bitched and they gave us what we wanted.. now we're still bitching. Not to mention.. season passes are something nintendo should've had a long time ago.. 1-2 characters in smash bros was like 5-8$ if i remember correctly... i would rather pay 20-25$ to secure them all rather than the 50$ individually...
