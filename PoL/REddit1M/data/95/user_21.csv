16489,I'm pretty sure the circlejerk here is DLC hate..
69552,"There's plenty of people that hate the idea of DLC and refuse to see any good in it. And then there are people saying ""if you don't want it don't buy it"". $60 will get you the complete game after all; the DLC has been stuff added after completion. "

&gt;As a result, the first-ever downloadable content for the mainline The Legend of Zelda series **is in development.**

Aonuma has also stated that he had content he wanted to add after the game was completed, and he was trying to figure out a way to do this. 

That being said, Nintendo has had a good track record when it comes to DLC. Their previous stuff was not cut content. Over the years, DLC has had a connotation that it *is* held bac content for the sake of more money. This is understandable because shitty companies do it over and over. But there are respectable companies that actually use DLC as extra content added after completing development. We just have to wait and see since we don't know yet. "
74650,I'm not trying to defend their PR; you asked for evidence to support why it's more likely its extra content rather than cut content and I gave it to you. Jeez.
