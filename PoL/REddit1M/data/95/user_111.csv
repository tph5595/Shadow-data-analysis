44770,"To be honest an in game billboard shirt (is this second life?) and a bunch of chests is undoubtably a very shitty DLC that does not add anything worthwhile to a Zelda game. 

But you gotta get that DLC money as soon as possible so you pump out silly stuff like that while you work on the real content and bundle it up as a season pass. 

I'd say the circlejerk is still happening on the side of the fanboys for now. "
