Link to the Past is a good game that holds up well but it does show some age in the visual design of dungeons. I've yet to beat it just because, while the gameplay is fun, the dungeons get kinda boring after a while from a lack of theming and unique music, for me. I just feel like I'm running through the same dungeon over and over and get tired of it all. I think Minish Cap is still the best 2D Zelda game I've played, and takes the good things that LTTP established and makes them better. (No 3DS, so I have no opinion on LBW to make). 

Majora's Mask also gets on my nerves. Not because it's bad, hardly, but because while you can say that the time element was meant to be frustrating to emulate the frustration of a world coming to an end, I think that's a cop out. Having to wait for the right time, being lost at figuring out what to do WITH a timer over your head, even with the right song of time variant to play. I wouldn't mind this level of ambiguity in where to go in a game like Wind Waker or Ocarina of Time, but with a time limit over my head, having to walk around with little direction is just frustrating. I think people who like Majora's Mask love the sidequests, sense of character, and darker nature of the game to the extent that they forget what an honestly frustrating slog it can be to play the main game. It doesn't deserve hate, but I just can't say it's one of my favorites. 

Also, while this might not be an unpopular opinion, I think Wind Waker's Hero Mode is the perfect example of how difficult I want a Zelda game to be. I have to use my bottles wisely, but I don't want to be at risk of dying all the time in a Zelda game. I just want to be on an adventure, where my main obstacles are figuring out what I haven't explored, rather than worrying about dying to a boss or slew of enemies. "
