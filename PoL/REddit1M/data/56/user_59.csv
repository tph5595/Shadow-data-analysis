12961,"These are pretty much the only ones I don't own, so I've never played them. They're still just so damn expensive."
13644,"How? There's so much padding and tedium throughout the game, and don't even get me started on Fi and her explaining everything to nip any thinking in the bud.

I'm currently playing through my 3rd or 4th attempt and this is the first time I've made it past the Lanayru mine. I'm finally at Sky Keep and while there's a lot of this game I enjoy, some parts I've hated so much that I don't know if I could stomach playing them again, tadtones being at the top of that list."
13750,Skyward Sword was partially cell shaded. It was kind of a mix between WW and TP.
14049,I think that's a pretty popular opinion here.
15528,"I have the Zelda 3DS XL that came with ALBW, it is great. I don't have the DS ones. Will likely play a ROM if I can't get ahold of them by the time I get there on my Zelda timeline run."
15705,"Yes, she is."
15885,"I loved TP, I don't understand all of the hate it gets. Though the parts where you're finding the tears can drag on a bit, I thought, as a whole, the game was fantastic."
15949,"Now, the cheapest I've seen it is $45. I really want to give the DS Zelda games a go, but just can't afford them."
18922,"Art style has never been a deal breaker for me in this series. The variety let's them be creative and try new things, which is great. I want to be entertained and/or challenged with Zelda. I found the world and characters of TP fun and interesting, but I mostly loved the atmosphere of the dungeons. Other than the longer wolf parts with the tear collecting, I was having a ton of fun.

Skyward Sword on the other hand, which I'm about to finish for the first time, is one of my least favorite. The story, dungeons, and atmosphere were definitely high points, but for much of the game, I just wasn't having fun. There was too much padding and everything outside of the dungeons boiled down to a fetch quest. Also, there's very little challenge in the puzzles, especially with Fi telling you what to do before you get a chance to try. So it fails on both of my most important criteria. I still say I like it over all, it's just not what I want out of Zelda.

So I guess, much like you said, it depends on what you want out of these games."
