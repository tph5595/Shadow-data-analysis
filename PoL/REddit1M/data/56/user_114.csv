49429,I think what made the game so good was how well it worked on a portable. Really easy to pick up and put down and lots of little stuff to do. It wasn't that memorable mostly because almost nothing notable happened in the story and there were barely any characters. A Link to the Past had much better world building than ALBW and way more variety in the things you had to do. ALBW never felt like there was any change in what I was doing.
49671,If more Zelda games were like Link's Awakening or Majoras Mask where you had a new world to learn then the series could be so much fresher. There's nothing left to explain about Hyrule and so all the junk they explain in newer games just makes Hyrule's history and lore less interesting because it's always trying to be one upped in some boring and hamhanded way.
