4000,I don't have any interest at all in Link and Zelda being a couple. 
8927,"Yep. I love both characters but I'm just not in to the idea of them being a couple.
One of the reasons I prefer the twilight princess storyline compared to skyward sword. :)"
9227,"I agree. :) I much prefer Link and Zelda being good friends who work together to save the people of hyrule.
It is a rather unpopular opinion at least with the folks I talk to. I get the ""how could you NOT ship them!?"" thing all the time. 
I'm not denying anything. I'm just not that fond of the idea."
9701,"That's exactly how I feel. :) 
I don't deny it when it's in games like skyward sword but I always like the zelda stories a bit better when the two of them work together to save the people. And they don't force some romantic plot between them. 
I never usually bring it up but this thread seems like the right place to. 
I also hate when people who have never played the game before do that. ""Isn't that the game that you rescue a princess?"" 

"
9865,I remember this too. Everyone I knew didn't like it all that much.
17498,I have thought about that a couple times too. Haha
87443,"I don't really deny it in skyward sword. I just didn't like it is all. (The romance parts of the story at least).
And the idea that they would be together in every game is kinda silly to me. :)"
87480,:) 
87527,No time for love ladies. Got to save the world. 
87567,I feel so bad for her. I love Saria.
87857,"I agree. I like to think of Link as a ""married to the people"" sort of guy. :)
And I agree. Skyward sword zelda and Tetra are the most ""friendly"" with each other but almost all the fanart (that I have seen) is from twilight princess. A game in which they barely talk to each other and he is far close to Ilia and Midna than her. "
92920,Absolutely.  This is how I see him. :)
98125,Haha not in that way. I just have a lot of respect for her character. :)
105202,hahaha I got ya'
