Being stuck in a claustrophobic dungeon when I could be out exploring the land is not my favourite part of the game.

 I actually prefer more linear dungeons, where you move through doing one puzzle after another (ie Shadow Temple) rather than temples with a large hub area that plays like a giant puzzle in itself (Wind Temple, Water Temple, Lakebed Temple).

There's a point where it feels more like you're walking steps through a giant mathematical equation rather than playing a game. "
