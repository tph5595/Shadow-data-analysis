23601,"Just another friendly reminder to people, people always downvote things that they don't agree with whether they add to conversation or not.

The downvote button is made so you can downvote what **doesn't add to conversation** and if you're looking for legitimate unpopular opinions, filter this by ""controversial"" instead of ""best"" because in most threads like this, the most popular opinion will be upvoted to the top."
