16237,"I agree that an HD remake of TP would be awesome. I find that the game hasn't aged as well as WW (even discounting the HD version, which was great) because of the blocky hands. (It's the main thing that bugged and bugs me about it.) Besides that, the story and the different elements were awesome. Plus a bunch of items. :)  
  
I think though, that to be fair with other games, a TP remake, if there ever is one, should not come out on the Wii U, as it hasn't been long enough. I would however play the shite out of it on any console it comes out!"

You know everything about the room you're in the moment you enter it. The puzzles become way too easy, and the enemies become a joke..."
