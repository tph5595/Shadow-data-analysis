23983,"I thought I was the only Zelda fan who thought this. I don't dislike the dungeons, but they're still my least favorite part of the game. The feeling of completing a dungeon and getting to go back to the overworld and explore is great."
24180,"First dungeon is by far the worst. I stopped at the same point and made a post asking if continuing was worth it because Skyview Temple, especially the boss fight was brutally horrible. I was encouraged to continue, and now I'm very happy I did. SS has so much bad in it, but even more good. The greatness of the game overwhelms the bad making it really worth playing, but it's many flaws stop it from being the best Zelda game.

I hate motion controls to."
24348,"I think everything. It seems like people who like ALttP better have strong nostalgia for it so they prefer it, which is ok, but doesn't make it the better game. I think the only way ALttP is better is it's harder, since ALBW was a bit easy in my opinion.

Edit: but I'd highly recommend playing ALBW after ALttP if you have the time and willingness! I did it the other way around and think my experience would have been better in the proper order."
24635,"I love all the canon ones, except the FS games. I haven't played adventures, but the other was by far the worst Zelda game I've played. It wasn't even a good game. The puzzles were: hey there's four Links and 4 buttons? How we gonna figure this out?"
25354,Seriously? 70% of the posts are fan art and an interesting debate comes up that may have been done before and you're mad?
