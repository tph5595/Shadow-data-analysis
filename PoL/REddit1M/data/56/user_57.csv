It was definitely fun, but there are several Zelda games better than it, including Skyward Sword. I beat A Link Between Worlds once, when it was released, and have barely touched it since. Skyward Sword, on the other hand, I beat it the first week it came out, immediately started a new file in Hero Mode, and played that because I loved it so much. I beat Skyward Sword twice within seven days, and have probably beaten in seven or eight times since its release."
14097,"Exactly why that was an unpopular opinion.

However, I agree. Several times after the first playthroughs, I became more aware and less forgiving of the ""padding and tedium,"" as you so eloquently put it. However, I felt as though Skyward Sword was meant more to be a work of art than a blockbuster title, and that's what it was. I still stand by my opinion that Skyward Sword is a wonderful game, but I think the primary reasons for this were that I was caught up in the art style, the story, etc. I thought the gameplay was great, and the motion controls were nearly flawless for me.

I understand where you're coming from completely. I actually wrote a piece about it on zeldadungeon.net a while back highlighting these points."

I, personally, have never had issues with the motion controls, except for when I didn't know that HDTV's had a ""game mode,"" and the Wii's AV inputs would cause delays. That may be the only time I had an issue with the game. Other than that, I felt as though I was taking part in a work of art. The music is definitely among my favorite in the series, I thought the majorities of the dungeons were top notch, and the fact that the overworld was dungeon-like made those small areas seem larger to me. I agree, the world was small, and without a way of connecting the three areas, it seemed smaller. However, one of my favorite things in games is when you can see an inaccessible area early on, and wonder, ""how am I going to get there?"" and trudge on through the game, excited to find out what is behind that wall or on the other side of the chasm. Skyward Sword, in my opinion, did an awesome job of keeping you excited about the progress of the game. However, it definitely has its faults. The bosses were less than intimidating in some instances, and there were very few where I had that Zelda feeling of running around saying, ""oh, shit! Oh, shit!"" while trying to figure out what to do. I still love Skyward Sword, but not as much as I did when it was first released."

Unfortunately, I don't think Skyward Sword is a game that can be remade on a future console utilizing classic controls due to the fact that the combat was centered on directional swings. Everything else I feel that used motion could be redesigned, but the combat, I do not believe."
