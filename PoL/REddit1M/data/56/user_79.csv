16399,"I hate him.

I disliked him and thought he was annoying in Majora's Mask. Although I do think that there were some interesting bits about his bizarre character that did sort of work within Termina (and having his father present in the game helped a lot). 

If that had been his only appearance in the games, I'd probably be more okay with him overall. I'd say it was Wind Waker that really pushed me over the edge and made me hate him with a passion. I'd be perfectly happy to never see him again."

Part of it is that Hyrule Warriors looks amazing and the graphics are beautiful. Link and Zelda look absolutely fantastic in the new Smash Bros as well. Add in their tech demo of Link, and this just felt incredibly underwhelming.

[I mean these are the last four Links we've seen, I don't think it's weird that the Link from Zelda Wii U is rather lackluster in comparison.](http://imgur.com/xSB6eRB)

Then there was the silly robot thing. One of my biggest gripes about this style is that they aren't consistent with it and they let things get too goofy at the worst possible moments which ruins the atmosphere and kills my immersion (like Puppet Ganon in Wind Waker who may as well have had googly eyes). That robot gave me the impression that it's going to be a problem for me again.

At the same time I think it looks a million times better than Wind Waker. The more intricate details helps a bit to make up for the lack of texture. The style can also make for some beautiful scenery when it's being used well. Plus the gameplay looks like it could be promising so I'm still hopeful that the rest of the game will make up for it."

As for Link- those other three graphics styles look incredible. I don't mind the blue thing they've got going on, but it'd still look better with any of those other styles of graphics.
