0,"I think Makar is the single worst character in Wind Waker. Even worse than those cringeworthy pirates. He's not cute. He's a dried up fucking peanut testicle. He's annoying to play as. He just fucking squeaks. His mask looks like shit. The worst part is how everyone thinks he's cute.

Skyward Sword is one of the series' best games, right up there with Majora's Mask. The storyline was great and gave Zelda a lot more depth. Ghirahim is good at being a sinister yet camp villain, and he's fucking badass when you're fighting him at the very end. The horde battle was amazing. It had by far the best music of the series, almost as good as the Mario Galaxy series. The art style was really well done. The motion controls worked amazingly. Sure the character design was a bit too anime-esque and Demise was a bit two-dimensional, but every game, including Ocarina (Which is my second least favourite of the 3D games, just ahead of Twilight Princess), has it's flaws.

EDIT: Oh, and Navi is one of the least annoying companions.

1893,"I have to agree with you there. I don't dislike doing them, but they do get a bit tedious, especially when replaying them."
3738,"I agree with you in that the three timelines was unnecessary, but it is literally impossible for Wind Waker and ALTTP to exist in the same timeline. However I recall a theory that the oracle games took place in different timelines and were similar enough that the timelines came back together."
4542,I think its art style is just unoriginal and unappealing.
4626,But Hyrule isn't flooded in the child timeline (where TP takes place.)
4655,I wholeheartedly agree.
5062,"Majora's mask definitely has an, albeit large, cult following. You definitely have to read into it and pay a *lot* of attention to the lore to like it."
5204,Link me to another then.
5556,"Me too. Unappealing character design, unoriginal and RPG-esque art style, and annoyingly prolonged wolf sections."
5808,Do people not like Tigle?! D:
5836,Because there...aren't any others?
6264,"Go ahead. I searched before this. Oh, and I'm on mobile, so quit bitching about copying links because you're too dense to find a button."
6632,You're nothing but a coward who can't own up to being wrong.
8322,I hate them.
10052,But we only got it for Wind Waker and the godawful DS games.
11020,Definitely.
11071,*Why?!* ***WHY?!***
14799,"As much as I love Skyward Sword, I can agree with that last statement. I thought it was cool to have Ganon be just some guy who rose to power and became the King of Evil. ^^^^^^...Like ^^^^^^Hitler!"
25231,Huh?
