14919,"I agree.  I like the idea that link is trying to save the princess because he knows it's the right thing to do, and not just because he thinks shes cute or something like that.  Plus the only game where I I felt like that had any real emotional connection was skyward sword, and wind waker if you count tetra."
15021,I liked phantom hourgalss too.  It didn't pretend to be something it wasn't and overall it was easily worth the $30 I payed for it.
15124,"phantom hourglass and a link between worlds are definitely worth getting, especially if you're a fan of wind waker or a link to the past.  spirit tracks isn't as good it isn't a bad game either."
16251,I really hope you don't have to play as a female link in zelda u.  Maybe that makes me sexist but to be honest I don't care.  If the rumors are true it just seems so unnecessary and an attempt to pander and create buzz when the series already has a huge dedicated following.  I would feel the same way if they made a game where you play as a male samus.
16386,it sounds like you're only looking at sealed copies.  You can probably find a used one for $15-$30 on amazon or ebay.
