13331,Is there anyone in the games you can see link being with? lol
13573,I like The wind waker way more than any other zelda the others just seem boring in comparison.
14169,as for me I can see link being with tetra in wind waker only one i can think.

20466,Did you not like how Zelda U looked?
20995,"I completely agree I hated how the character models looked didn't like how you had to active the goddess cubes first, so fuck exploration and too many dumb fetch quests that pad out the game Also there was a lot of cringe worthy moments during the cut-scenes. I thought the story was a bit over rated as well its just the same old story of link saving zelda again with the master sword."
59947,I actually like how link looks in the zelda u trailer more than the others I never liked super realistic graphics and one of the reasons I did like wind waker was because it was goofy and didn't take itself so fucking seriously.  
63321,I tried link's awakening and got bored after the first dungeon and i'm pretty sure i'll still hate SS in 8 years.
144216,The only reason I don't like SS because I think its a half assed game. I can't get into links awakening because i've been spoiled by the later zeldas that have more polish and innovation.
