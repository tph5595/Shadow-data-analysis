4793,"Link's Awakening is the BEST Zelda game

Being old enough to remember when MM was first released, it's very strange to hear it being called one of the best of the series. I love the game, but I didn't know a single person who liked it when it was released.

e: in the same vein, Skyward Sword will be universally loved in about 8 years, it's a cycle.

e2: it's cool to hear so much love for Link's Awakening! I actually have a tattoo of the concept art for the Windfish, I'll post a pic if people are interested, lol"

If you hate SS now you most likely won't change your mind. Most of the people I know who hated MM when it came out still do."
