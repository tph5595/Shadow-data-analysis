67376,"Twilight Princess is a disappointment

Midna is overrated as hell

Zant is a crappy villain

Ilia is the most annoying character in the entire series and the romance between her and Link is forced and one-dimensional.

OoT's Water Temple isn't hard at all

Skyward Sword is awesome

The first LoZ has aged poorly"
