16282,"I honestly cannot understand why anyone has a problem with WW's art style. It's different from other Zelda titles (as if that matters?) but it's not some weird wild brand new style never before seen. It's slightly different from others in that series, thats all. Lots of other wildly popular games share that style. Otherwise it's a straight-up-and-down Zelda title. I think people just don't like the game and blame it on the art style to try and save face."
