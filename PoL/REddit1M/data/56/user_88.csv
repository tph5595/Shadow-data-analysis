18593,"Ocarina of Time is a dumbed-down version of a Link to the Past. 

Great game and I certainly don't doubt its influence. That said, if you break apart Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time, you can see just how much OoT borrows from ALttP. A Dark World, Master Sword, magic meter, etc. Navi just makes the game quite a bit easier since she just serves as a compass to remind you of what to do.

And there's nothing wrong about a game being streamlined or dumbed down. Skyrim is dumbed down from Oblivion and that was a fantastic game."
