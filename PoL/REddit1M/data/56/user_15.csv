4482,"I want Nintendo to release Ocarina of Time yet again for Wii U going a few steps further than what was made possible for 3DS.

Even if the visuals are the same as the 3DS I'll be happy with that, I just want to experience the most recent Ocarina of Time game on a huge TV."

I love me some Zelda so I don't mind the downvotes, and will continue voicing that yet another re-re-re-release of Ocarina of Time would be completely awesome."
