But it has a lot to do with the fact that my eyesight isn't that great--since all the colors in TP are so dark and everything's so blurry I can't see a damn thing.  Running into walls constantly.  This is why I absolutely love the cel-shaded games.  And also, yeah, I think cel-shaded graphics look way better, and age better as well."
