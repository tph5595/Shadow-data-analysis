1300,"I like Makar :( I will admit it sucks playing as him but as a character I think he's cute. 


As for my opinion, I dislike Majora's Mask a lot. My favorite parts of the zelda series have always been the dungeons, and I've never cared a whole lot for side quests, so you can see it's not quite up my alley. 

Also I found Wind Waker to be very easy and boring, and it's also one of my least favorite games, with SS, TP, and OOT being my favorites. "
