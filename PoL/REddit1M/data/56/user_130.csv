116044,"In short, the reason I prefer ALBW over ALttP is because it takes everything I enjoyed from ALttP, improves on it, and removes most of the stuff I disliked about ALttP. Don't get me wrong, ALttP is not a bad game. I think it just feels dated in some ways. I would recommend anyone who's played neither game to play ALBW first.

Reasons I prefer ALBW:

 Stamina bar

&gt;I felt like ALttP encouraged hoarding with it's magic gauge. If you ran out of magic you either had to go back to find enemies who dropped magic or use a green potion you were carrying to refill. It was much easier and less tedious to avoid using magic until absolutely necessary. Gathering bombs was annoying to a lesser extent. In ALBW world your stamina meter refills so you don't have to feel wasteful for using the fire rod or arrows on overworld enemies. You can't spam the weapons since you'll run out of stamina, but if you give it time it will recharge without having to grind for refills. I'm using items way more in ALBW than I did in ALttP.

Better Temples

&gt;The temples in ALBW have this snappy feeling to them. Sure they're a little easier but there are still good puzzles in them and I don't ever feel lost or bored like I did with some of the ALttP temples. If ALBW temples were just a bit longer they would be perfect.

Wall merging
&gt;Wall merging was a clever mechanic that makes you look at the dungeon and overworld layout differently. There are a lot of really cool major puzzles that use this mechanic, but they also have lots of rupees and hearts hidden on the walls that reward you for checking every nook and cranny and for trying to get to hard to reach spots.

Story
&gt;Neither have really in-depth stories but ALBW is quite a bit better imho. In ALttP you rescue nameless maidens who say fairly generic things after being rescued. In ALBW you rescue the descendants of the sages. The difference is that you get a chance to meet them and get a little feel for each character before they are whisked away by the bad guy. Also the Lorule story and backstory are interesting.

Lorule
&gt;The temples in ALBW's Lorule (dark world) can be done in almost any order. The only exception is one dungeon that requires a different dungeon at some point before it. While Hyrule is wide open to explore freely, Lorule is sectioned off and each section containing a temple has a mini-mission to complete in the overworld in order to get to (or through) the dungeon. Some mini-missions include a stealth mission, finding items, platforming, finding multiple temple entrances, etc. ALttP has a few of these but for the most part it's parallel dark world feels more like a lightly modified overworld when it comes to gameplay.

Better Combat
&gt;In ALBW, the circle pad makes movement very fluid as opposed to the D-pad in ALttP. I already mentioned the Stamina bar in ALBW. Weapons can now point diagonally unlike ALttP. Each item in ALBW can be used in combat and has slightly different abilities. In ALttP your shield goes up whenever you're not using an item/sword. In ALBW you actually have to choose to use your shield which I think is more interesting for gameplay since it punishes you for forgetting it. Later in the game you can uncover a way to upgrade all of your items to even more powerful forms.

Exploration
&gt;ALBW world gives you more reason to explore the overworlds and more things to find. Besides curiosity, you will want to explore ALBW's overworld to find rupees, monster pieces, mini-dungeons, and Maimais. Rupees are more important in this game because they are needed to rent and eventually buy your expensive items. Monster pieces are dropped by enemies and are necessary ingredients for making helpful potions. ALBW has a lot of mini-dungeons that are cleverly designed to be completed with a specific item (hookshot, sand rod, merging ability, etc) in order to get a reward. Maimais are scattered throughout both Hyrule and Lorule. For each 10 Maimais you find you can upgrade one of your items. Not to mention the little secrets that are hidden throughout the game like a hidden Hinox that bribes you to leave him in peace.

In 3D games you often need to look up and down around rooms for part of the puzzles or hints. In 2D Zelda games, it's often a little bit easier because you can see most of the things in a room at once so it's less likely that you will overlook something.

Another advantage of ALBW is that if you ever feel stumped by a dungeon or part of Lorule, you can skip it for a while and go to a different one since there's not a specific order you have to do them in. I've found that a lot of times when I'm stumped, it helps to take a break and come back to it later. ALBW allows you to do this but instead of just waiting you can work on a different part of the game."

Honestly, I think the references work both ways. If you enjoy ALBW and want to play ALttP afterwards your experience probably won't be too much difference than someone who played them in reverse order (as far as references are concerned). Both games share very similar overworlds/darkworlds that will seem familiar when playing the other game but have different tweaks, secrets, and small areas setting them apart that are fun to find. Each game has very different dungeons, but when you play whichever game second you'll notice themes, gameplay elements, and bosses that are similar.

I recommend ALBW first since I think it's more accessible (and better imho) and if you want seconds try ALttP and you'll appreciate their similarities and differences."
