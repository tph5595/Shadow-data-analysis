70427,"I'd rather have a brand new full 3D Zelda on the 3DS than a remake of anything.

I'd be OK with it being done in the OoT3D engine, or if it started as a TP remake and became a new game later in development (which happens a lot for Zelda) but I'd just rather something new."
70856,You say this when the latest entry in the series is the most nonlinear since the original and the least hand-holdy since the Oracle games?
