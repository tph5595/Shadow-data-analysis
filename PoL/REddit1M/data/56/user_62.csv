13257,"In Twilight Princess, I was super pissed off that you fight Ganon before Ganondorf. Sure, the horseback fight was epic as hell, but Ganon is a God!!! I was also mad that Ganon was simply a giant boar, compared to his more anthro forms from previous games. I'm sorry, but seeing him stand on his hind legs with two sai in his hands and lightning striking behind to form a grotesque silhouette has always stuck in my mind.

Edit: Secrets."
