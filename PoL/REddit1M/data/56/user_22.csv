6363,"I hate WW because of the art style and sailing.

I can't get into MM because it's to different and almost doesn't register as a ""Zelda"" game to me. 

PH and ST rank just above CDi titles as playable.

48224,I am not opposed to cel-shading. It's was the character design (stupid stumpy limbs and giant heads) like everyone was born with dwarfism and downs. 
82675,"Don't get me wrong. I think zelda can look fun and cartoony because there's always been a bit of silliness in the series writing. LttP wasn't overly dark and serious like Super Metroid proves a game could be at the time and I loves that style and it's re-emergence in LBW. I liked the overall look of SW, it just had stupid mook characters again like Groose and those Kiwi-markar things. "
