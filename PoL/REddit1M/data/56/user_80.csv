16640,"I agree with you on Majora's Mask. I honestly can't see why people claim it's the best Zelda game. For me it's easily the *worst* of the 3D Zeldas. I hated the time mechanic, I thought the save system was terrible and on top of that it was poorly explained and it didn't really make sense how you retained some items and kept others, I didn't really care for all of the minor characters (there was really no motivation for me to do the quests that just gave you useless masks), and yeah just FOUR dungeons. Absolutely inexcusable. Also I thought it was weird how people complained about having to do certain areas in Skyward Sword again when the repetition in Majora's Mask is on a completely other level. At least in Skyward Sword the areas changed significantly between the first and second times you play through them.

I was really hyped to play Majora's Mask based on the following it's developed in a few years but I was terribly disappointed and I honestly can't see what the big deal is."
