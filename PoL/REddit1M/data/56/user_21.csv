5867,I don't even understand why this is an unpopular opinion.  Why is this such a big deal?  What does it add other than tired cliches?
6837,"Twilight Princess is easily, hands down, *the* most over-rated Zelda game ever, and it's essentially due to the 'lowest common denominator' art style.

The story was one of the worst in the series, the music was immensely bland, the world had no cohesion, the combat was stiff (and those rad hidden techniques were mostly useless), everything from the plot to the gameplay was all segmented 'pieces', the pacing was wretched... I could go on forever.

I don't think it's the *worst* (that goes to Skyward Sword) Zelda game, not by a long shot... but it isn't anywhere near the top.

And all of that cutesy romantic crap that everyone loves so much can go rot.  It's a big, ugly, campy mark on an otherwise amazing lore and setting.

Bonus:  The Water Temple is easy as hell.  Every 3D Zelda is incredibly easy, with the only exception being certain parts of Majora's Mask."
11642,...As opposed to realism which has been done an infinite amount of times? That's *still* fresh?
46909,"&gt;Then there was the silly robot thing

Sorry, but have you ever played Zelda before?  Pretty much *every* Zelda game features some form of ancient 'robot' that shoots lasers.  Hell, Majora's Mask was about two steps away from a modern day society.

Or were you just talking about the design?

I agree that the Link design could be a little better, but I'm more happy with it than I would be with *another* rehash of the TP design which has been in use for about ten years now.  The tech demo version was *literally* just TP Link with better lighting, Smash 4's is the same with a slightly different color palette, and Hyrule Warriors again, the same, but this time it looks like they couldn't decide if they wanted him to be a girl or not.

While I agree the new design could be *better*, it's still a huge step beyond the same old design that's been in use since the 2004 TP trailer."
47161,"That was the *first* thing I noticed, when watching the first gameplay trailers.  The overall animations in TP were just... wonky."
47199,"TIL the basis of the entire Zelda franchise is ""uninspired""."
47229,It's the second newest 3D Zelda...
77321,"&gt;I do think there's a significant difference between ancient technology buried in an old temple and robots roaming freely in Hyrule Field

That could be a plot point?  Something which is normally contained to ancient, disused and relatively unknown areas is now mucking about freely for some unknown reason?

But aside from that, what do you think makes it look goofy?  I don't think it looks especially sinister or anything, but it doesn't really have any specifically silly features.  It's pretty much just a beamos with legs.

As for the styles, I guess we can agree to disagree.  The Smash 4 one is the best of the bunch, and the tech demo was pretty cool even though it's just Twilight Princess HD, but HW's style just looks like any free MMO to me.  The kind you'd see on Facebook saying something like ""male gamers only!"", or something like that.  The actual graphical quality is fine (for the character models, anyway) but the style/art direction is just completely basic and uninspired."
106367,That is almost certainly the case.
