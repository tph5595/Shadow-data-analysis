99396,I couldn't ever get into skyward sword. I hate the controls I'm so glad they are going back to button controls and not motion. I like to relax while playing a game not have to sit up and swing my arms around. I wish the motion controls were and option and not a requirement.
99918,Also i think this is link at the beginning of the game in his civilian clothes (for lack of a better word) kind of like the beginning of WW and twilight princess. He could look way different with chainmail and his green tunic. 
100200,"I don't think it was particularly hard just easy to miss stuff and have to redo the water levels and start again. It's just time consuming if you mess up. I think most people wrongfully label it hard, in stead of potentially frustrating. "
100573,"I'm going to have to disagree with you on that. Skyward sword is the worst zelda game in many years and a link between world's is one of the best. But that's just my opinion. 

I hated the tiny world map (meant to seem huge) and the motions controls. "
100750,I've beaten a link between world's 3 times now I think. I have yet to beat Skyward sword because I hate the controls and the exploration is non existent. .
101020,It started out as a remake then they said they wanted to make it more so they did. It was originally not supposed to be a completely new game. 
101473,They (Nintendo) already said that this is nonsence. Link is still a dude. They almost changed Impa into an old man once though. 
101864,Skyward sword almost made me lose hope in zelda games. 
108999,I do like to revisit places to get things that I couldn't access before. That doesn't really bother me. I just didn't like the over world or the flying. I also like to lay in bed while playing video games sometimes and the motion controls made it so I couldn't.  I had to be sitting forward or standing in order to fly the damn bird downward. I just only like motion controls for things like golf and bowling.
