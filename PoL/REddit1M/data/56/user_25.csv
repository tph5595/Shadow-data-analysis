7218,"I liked the wolf segments of TP, a lot. I can see why people hated them, but I really liked everything about them. Midna, finding/killing the bugs, looking around the twilight, senses and spirits, the wolf mechanics, etc.

Edit for another unpopular opinion: ... TP is also probably the *only* game that could have gotten me into the series, which it did. Allow me to explain why, a bit of a wall of text incoming:

Let's see, before TP I'd seen small segments of gameplay from: WWHD, OoT, MM, and one or two of the 2D games. At the time, the 2D games didn't really interest me at all since I just wasn't a fan of 2D games in general. WWHD looked kind of interesting and fun but not enough so to get me to investigate the series, and I wasn't much of a fan of the styling. OoT and MM got me a little curious but I dismissed them at first due to their age (I shouldn't have, I know). I could explain why I wouldn't have been interested in the rest of the games in the series too, but you get the idea.

TP though? TP caught my attention immediately. The game style, the graphics/art style which people seem to be disliking a lot in this thread, the short bit of story I saw and the general design and mechanics - they all appealed to me so much. I had to investigate and play the game for myself, and I had a wonderful time even though I was playing it almost eight years after it's release.

Having played TP and liked it so much, I then had to properly look into the rest of the series. I now really like the other LoZ games and it's my favourite game series, but I still *love* TP most of all. It's my favourite ever game by quite a way, and I don't think it'll leave that spot for quite some time; maybe it'll surprise me but I don't even see Zelda U having the potential to push it aside. It had noticeable flaws, but I enjoyed the rest of it so much I can completely ignore them.

Edit 2: Hmm, I can't tell how many upvotes I'm getting because people disagree with me and how many I'm getting because people agree with me. Oh well."

For example, the graphics headed in a direction that some people just inevitably would not like. Then some people just don't like the ""darkness"" of the game. Also, I love Midna so very much, but I can see why her attitude annoys some people especially in the beginning. And so on, it all just comes down to opinions. I suppose it's inevitable that there's going to be people who hated TP as much as I, and some others, loved it."
