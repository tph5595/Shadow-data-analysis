11540,"I think ocarina was good and all but it was not THE BESTEST GAME EVER OF ALL TIME EVER. I also have given up playing minish cap Everytime they mention the kinstone fusing. 

Also on the link and zelda not being a couple. I would think it would be wierd if zelda married someone who was not link and you just worked for them as a hired swordsman. I would feel better if Zelda stayed single in that respect."
