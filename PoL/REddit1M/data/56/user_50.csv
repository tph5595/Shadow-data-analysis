11782,"I hate Twilight Princess. 

I think Zelda games should come with an option to skip dialogue and cutscenes. I just got WW:HD and I'm currently on my second play through. Seriously so much time is wasted by the fucking incessant talking and cut scenes. I only need to know the goddamn pirate password, oh my god. "
