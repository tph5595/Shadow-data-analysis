9369,"I came here to say that I actually like Navi and don't find her annoying.  I actually think she's really helpful in a first playthrough... but OP already mentioned Navi so I'm going to go with my other unpopular opinion.

I really DON'T like Midna.  I think she's bossy and annoying.  Tatl was a brat, but at least she changed for the better pretty early in the game.  I get that Midna is going through some messed up crap, but I don't think she was very mature about it.
