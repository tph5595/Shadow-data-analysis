14804,"I think LTTP and OOT are severely overrated. Regarding LTTP, I think it's a great game, but one of the weaker games in the series. OOT, on the other hand, I think is downright fantastic, but really isn't deserving of being put on this pedestal and worshipped as one of the greatest games of all time like many tend to do. Along with that, I think SS is the second best of the series. I also think the original Legend of Zelda game is incredibly cryptic and hasn't aged very well. I also don't care if whether or not Majora's Mask gets a 3ds remake. I think Minish Cap is the best 2D Zelda. Last, LBW, while a great game, doesn't deserve the sheer amount of praise that it gets."
