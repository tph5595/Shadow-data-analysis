4299,"i played Majora's mask and although i enjoyed playing it, id call it my second least favorite game. i did everything in the game, but i wouldnt say it is very replayable. most zelda games hookshot me and make me want to play them over and over, but majora's mask, i dont even care. I enjoyed playing it but im sure i will never enjoy it as much again unlike most others.

As for the timeline, I kind of like it. mostly because after my first play through of twilight princess(my favorite) it made me kind of sad to know everything would be flooded and eventually become the great sea of wind waker.

also fuck tatl that annoying little shit.

I loved the gameplay from phantom hourglass and spirit tracks, loved the temple of the ocean king.
