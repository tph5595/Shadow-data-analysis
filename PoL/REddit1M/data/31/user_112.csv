49375,Nah I think he's talking about the desiccated corpses that lay their spirit eggs in your chest like a xenomorph spider.
51800,"Actually, it's more than that. Quite a bit more, really. It's funny because I was having this conversation yesterday with someone on a totally unrelated subreddit thread (it hit the front page so you might've seen it) but at it's core we can argue ""underage"" is indeed a fictitious social construct, but actually it's way more than that in practise.

""Underage"" is a state of development (or lack thereof) which the law deems to be very serious if not respected by adults, typically with severe tangible consequences. Sometimes for better or worse, as some people absolutely deserve those consequences, where often strange cases occur where young people (almost always boys) are penalised for having sexual relations with their girlfriends who are only a year below the ""magic number"" in that country/state. Thankfully certain laws have been made to mitigate that happening.

However, ""underage"" isn't just a social construct in my opinion. Biologically it becomes possible for girls to have sex much younger than many of the minimum ages set by law/society, yes, but they can also therefore become pregnant. It's undeniable that their bodies are rarely equipped to deal with this process safely yet, and carrying the baby to term can be extremely dangerous for both the mother and her unborn child. For this reason I sincerely believe that there is an ""underage"" simply in nature where a woman is definitely much more at risk if she is exposed to sex.

All this ignores the whole ""when are we actually mentally ready to choose to have sex"" debate because personally, I have no idea when that is. There are people in their 20s or even 30s who I'd deem unable to cope with sex and everything that goes with it, whereas I'm sure there are teenagers who are perfectly capable of knowing who and what they want, all risks considered.

Obviously take all of this with a grain of salt because this only really deals with PIV sex, and doesn't exactly explain why the law also prohibits other intimacy like groping or passionate kissing. I'd be curious to hear people's thoughts on this.

Just to be clear, I think the law should always be respected whatever it is in your area regarding sexual intimacy with minors. I understand that the law often varies widely and is flawed for many reasons, but I do think it's one of the very few laws that truly acts as a front line defence of vulnerable individuals from people who seek to hurt them and not seek equal, loving relationships with them.

Another interesting debate is where do we draw the line? Do sexualised minors in games/anime pose a problem? If it's a crime it's certainly victimless, as everyone involved are clearly not real people. Can we trust people to leave it there, and not try to impose that on real life? I'd love to hear people's thoughts in a non-judgemental, honest environment.

Edit: fixed some words."
52600,"I wonder if this is why many people are sometimes very reluctant to categorise ""paedophiles"" and ""sexual predators of minors"" as two entirely different things. Which, of course, they are.

Personally I feel wholly sorry for people who are the former. They didn't choose their attractions and I'm sure many people would never act on their dark desires. The stigma is so blanketing that they feel unable to seek help for it, so they're doomed to live feeling like monsters.

You make a very good point about the distinction in your edit, but sadly it's dangerous to even speak out about it since people will often immediately paint you as a sympathiser for the latter and will lash out accordingly."
53925,"Personally I think it only becomes a problem when characters are sexualised who blatantly look like children. A few people replied to you with examples such as Yoko or Saaya, but they are clearly very well developed and attractive. Young, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. I don't fully understand why their creators decided to age them at 14 and 15 respectively, but I see no problem with finding them attractive if we are to indulge in the typical ""hourglass figure"" or ""nice tits/ass"" stereotype of attractiveness. It's when characters who are clearly underdeveloped and not even past puberty that I think it's a problem.

Take your examples. Riju is young because of story purposes. She is struggling with being thrown into the role of Gerudo chief so suddenly from the death of her mother. It's an interesting character story and I liked it a lot, especially from the optional diary belonging to her that you can read and understand her troubles. However, look at her. Wide hips. Breasts. Confident stature as she sits on her throne or faces Vah Naboria with us. There's no reason to believe that Nintendo wanted to paint her as a sexual character despite going strongly against social norms. They do paint her as a vulnerable character, but not purely because she is ""too young.""

Now we take a look at Mipha. It's a bit trickier here because of the fact she is a Zora, and therefore varies wildly biologically to Hylians or Gerudo. That said, she still has characteristics of a developed female, such as ""breasts."" The biggest piece of evidence used for Nintendo still showing her to be ""of age"" is the fact she has crafted the traditional Zora attire for Link, her intended husband. Her father and brother are both fully aware and accepting of this, and the only real dissent comes from the Zora people themselves due to racial tensions with Hylians and the resentment of Link for taking her away from them. There is no question of her age or ability to choose, at least not that I found.

**TL;DR** Riju and Mipha are perfectly fine to be attracted to in my opinion, they were clearly never intended to appeal to paedophiles by Nintendo. If we have such a problem with people just looking ""young"" then perhaps all the accepted pornography of teenagers dressing up as schoolchildren should be banned. I obviously don't believe that, but it's an interesting double-standard that society seems to engage in."
54391,"I agree, but hopefully the mods don't mind as long as everyone remains respectful to eachother. It's certainly not a pointless discussion, I think it's very relevent, especially in a game with so many potential female love interests (Riju, Mipha and Zelda are the main, developed characters that seem to resonate with people)

I hope you don't think I or anyone else implied that you simply like her because she might be underage or resembles a loli. I don't believe that for a second and I think it would take a notable ignorance or maliciousness for others to accuse you of that."
54770,"Absolutely. I'd love nothing more than for people to be able to come forward (and seek help if they want it) about whatever they are attracted by. I say this about any attraction, kink or fetish: if they aren't harming anyone or themselves, it is legal, and everyone involved gives full consent, let them be.

I agree, the laws should be reserved for those who act on those urges. Not people who are simply attracted through no fault of their own, which thankfully doesn't seem to happen often. It's usually people consuming child porn or molesting children themselves that are punished, and that's exactly how it should be. Both things involve victims who are simply too young to consent and are exploited regardless."
54872,Only with that attitude! ;)
55008,"Indeed. I doubt paedophiles will ever reach the top of the pecking order in society and that's probably for the best, but we should definitely focus on helping these people and not just treating them like cockroaches. At least the people not acting on their urges, of course."
