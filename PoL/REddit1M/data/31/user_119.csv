But being the reincarnation of a goddess and of royal blood probably comes with some pretty badass genetics so I wouldn't call Zelda's an unrealistic body type. 

I would also have to guess that the average lifestyle in Hyrule is quite active (fighting bokoblins, shield surfing, traveling, truffle hunting) leading to all of the other female travelers to be the more athletic types we see in the game. I really don't see any of them as an unrealistic average for their setting. "
54547,"No, you didn't say unrealistic. But you did say that the great fairies had the ""most realistically average"" body type, to which I had to disagree with. 

My justification being if none of the other females in the game are unrealistic, and they vastly outnumber the four great fairies, the fairies can't be realistically average. Realistically average body type would be the travelers like the truffle hunter girls, because there are a greater number of that body type. "
