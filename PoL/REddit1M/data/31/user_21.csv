17088,"I find it funny that most of the Vai in the Gerudo city don't actually seem to care about Voe entering the city, just the guards. Hell, many of them outright get dissapointed when they realize guys can't come into the city, and a number of them are extremely dedicated to meeting and settling down with one to the point that they have several classes dedicated to acclimating themselves to their presence. The several Gerudo who either know or find out that you're a man just straight up don't care. It almost came off to me that most Gerudo resent this antiquated law."

24754,"Let's just say Kass' kids inherited his musical ability from him, but they seem to have also inherited some *tastes* from their mother. "
25035,"That seems counter intuitive haha, all the other races seem to get along just fine with having their sexes coexist. I get that male Gerudo are rare, but by the sheer fact that there are young Gerudo they have to have fathers right? Seems like the best way to normalize men in that society would be to have the kids grow up with a father figure, but I'm not a psychologist or anything so fuck if I know. "

59618,Them Gerudo genes are mighty dominant. Just like everything else the Gerudo do. * *sweats profusely* *
59786,"I agree with most of this but there are in fact female gorons, however their sexual dimorphism is almost non-existent."
59885,Let's just split the difference and go with throbbing hard cloaca.
