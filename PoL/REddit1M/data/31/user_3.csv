1537,"It ain't weird bro.

I so have the hots for Princess Ruto, myself.

...

... POST timeskip, of course!!"
43977,"I can see folks going there. You can mistake her for like, a 20 year old, like you can with Ariel and Jasmine."
54838,"She says in the movie that she's 16.

But when it's an animated character and they look so adult-like anyway, I think it's okay. Like this Gerudo chief. You could easily mistake her for a grown-up.

The ""she's not real so it's okay"" argument doesn't apply when they're clearly young, like with lolis."
56295,"It's like art I find of Tetra from Wind Waker.

I understand the appeal in a pretty face so it's okay by me if they age them up from the neck down, but when they're still unmistakably 12 or whatever, that weirds me out."
75108,"If it's a cartoon character, it's not the numbers that matter, it's the appearance.

She looked, moved, and spoke like a little kid, pre-timeskip. Telling me she aged by Hobbit years would change nothing.

On the other hand, if I saw her post-timeskip, and someone said she was 8, I'd be ""pfff. I don't see it."""
148408,"And in the case of Riju, who they clearly intended to be the most attractive Gerudo in the game, it feels like they're trying to incriminate us with entrapment.

Its like Tornado of Terror in One Punch Man. They clearly worked overtime to give her a pretty face, so I can understand it if people look up R34 of her if where she's been aged up. But it's uncomfortable that the writer goes out of his way to make an underage character look as alluring as possible. "
