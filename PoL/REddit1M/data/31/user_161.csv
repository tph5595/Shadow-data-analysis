147445,"That is one of the more distrusting aspects of the animation and comic mediums. They are very pulpy, which means low quality control, but seem to like having young characters. But the artists don't seem to know what young people look like, act like, or sound like. So the end result is someone who the audience is told is 12 but is otherwise an adult. This sends some people mixed messages and that is primarily the artist's fault.
