14974,"I can see that.  I can also see having a crush on Mipha.  She's there when I need her the most, and that's amazing to someone who has trouble trusting people with that sort of thing.  That and the whole unrequited-love/tragic-demise thing makes me feel really sorry for her.  I want to give her a hug, but she's a ghost, and she's busy trying to keep me alive because my stupid ass didn't notice a Lynel before it noticed me.  Marry me, ethereal fish lady."
