45691,"I know this may not be the place for it but... You're allowed to be attracted to a 13 year old. Sounds crazy I know but A: It's a video game and the number value of her age is irrelevant to her being cute/sexy and B:No one can control what they find attractive.

Just felt like saying that since it seems like people may actually be taking offence from someone saying Riju is attractive."
45752,Shouldn't be getting down voted for this you're completely right.
45838,So many people in this thread forgetting how to spell Mipha...
47468,"Yep.

Edit: should note actually that a kid is still a kid and there are laws to this kind of thing(jeez this isn't fun to talk about) but we can't act like it's wrong to find someone attractive."
48856,"Pretty much. It's also worth noting that someone made this character and they obviously made them to be attractive. It's not like they even look like a kid. Riju is around the same height as link, she's wearing semi revealing clothing and seductive makeup. SO NINTENDO IS PEDO? AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH.. yeah..."

54183,"Personally, I'm just saying you can't fault someone for stating what they find attractive because that's literally just who they are and there's nothing they can do about it. Especially in this case where sexuality is being, I'd say maybe even strongly implied within the game.

Honestly though there are strict laws on this kind of thing for a reason. Idk enough about the laws to say much but I will say that we should be less judgmental of pedophiles. They are people too and we should be more open to their struggles as well as obviously look for ways to help them."
