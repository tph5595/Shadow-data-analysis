I'm not really attracted by the Gerudos with the exception of Riju. Damn, her design is flawless, cute and sexy at the same time."
32977,"She's a fictional character and the devs built her just like an adult, it's not my fault. Well, to each his own. *Edit: a word*"
33514,Mipha is bae
41625,Also [Saaya from Suisei no Gargantia](http://suisei-no-gargantia.wikia.com/wiki/Saaya)
50240,"Yeah her design was defenitely built to make her attractive and sexy [Riju] (http://rinmaidtsuoka.tumblr.com/post/158524341364)

Even she uses high heels and the camera does show her body in a teasing way."
50837,"I wouldn't say that I'm right or wrong. But I feel emotionally and sexually (there's why hentai exists) attracted by Riju and Mipha even if they are fictional characters. But for example, no one disapproves others opinions regarding Zelda which is 17 years old, still a minor by law. "
51157,^ Same page as you
53877,Well it is a sensitive theme to discuss here. It was me who started this whole pointless discussion. I was talking about Riju's design and why I was attracted to her as a character. I never said that I feel this way because she's underage and resembles a loli. I don't like the Gerudo females because they are too masculine for my taste.
59777,"&gt;I hope you don't think I or anyone else implied that you simply like her because she might be underage or resembles a loli.

Nope, not at all. I do like Riju the same way I like [Saaya](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/d3/a0/7b/d3a07be8e3647d0245e85bee5f525122.jpg) they are presumably underage but they are developed as young adults IMO. They have different bodies but I see them both as fully mature women.

For example, [Purah](http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda/images/c/cb/Purah_-_Breath_of_the_Wild.png/revision/latest?cb=20170322223018) has a body of a child (even smaller than Riju) yet she is  100+ years old and I bet someone in this world feels attracted to her character (old scientist with a loli body), which I think it's totally fair and legit. Also she is a lot less sexualized by Nintendo than Riju, Mipha, zelda and even Link with the gerudos clothes."
65777,"&gt; However, look at her. Wide hips. Breasts. Confident stature as she sits on her throne or faces Vah Naboria with us. There's no reason to believe that Nintendo wanted to paint her as a sexual character despite going strongly against social norms. They do paint her as a vulnerable character, but not purely because she is ""too young.""

I definitely agree with you and add my observation. Even the developers [emphasize](https://youtu.be/bGB8C33p-qk?t=23m12s) her femininity showing her wide hips, high heels and [body posture](https://youtu.be/A-8dMEcbCmU?t=28m51s), usually crossing her legs, protecting it from someone to look under her open clothes.
