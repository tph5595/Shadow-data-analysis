48765,"&gt;all the other races seem to get along just fine with having their sexes coexist

Gorons are the only other race that are all one gender, and clearly have a different biology from the others. 

&gt;male Gerudo are rare

~~Understatement of the century right there~~(meh). There are no mentions of male Gerudo existing now or in the past (that I know of). In OoT, it's mentioned that a single male is born to the Gerudo once every ~~1000~~ 100 years. Urbosa mentions that legends say Ganon was once a Gerudo, so we can assume Gannondorf existed in this timeline. If that's the case, then the cycle may have been broken, since Ganon was alive all this time. 

&gt;by the sheer fact that there are young Gerudo they have to have fathers right?

My hypothesis is that young Gerudo girls who live in Gerudo Town are born to unwed (or widowed) mothers. I think it'd be pretty common for a Gerudo to head over to the Oasis to have some fun with a handsome trader and wind up pregnant. "
