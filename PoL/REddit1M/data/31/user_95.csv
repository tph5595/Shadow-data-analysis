49266,"I myself am built like a linebacker, and was one. lol. I realize not everyone can be itty bitty, but after a few years of working at a gym and seeing people who very stubbornly thought they were ""built big"" completely change their body image after some hard work, it occurs to me that nobody is ""built"" to be overweight. Some frames are larger, but it is completely possible for any person to recomp their body and become their fittest self. The great fairies are, for lack of a better word, chubby. I agree with loving the skin you're in and being confident in your body, but I don't think we should encourage being overweight and make it into the ""average"". You've got one body which is capable of incredible things, and to sit around and be complacent with being unhealthy is a complete waste. It's a slippery slope you're building on when you start trying to put being overweight in the position of being the average. "
