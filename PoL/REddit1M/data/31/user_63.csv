I came up playing nes zelda but i was too young to understand til later years. I fell in love with princess zelda. Not like in a hentai way. Like in a "" i want my wife to look like that AND act like that"". To this day, my ""type"" has blue eyes, blonde, short, sharp chin and jawline , sharp nose. The whole nine. Ive been lucky enough to find 3 women to love who shared those features and personality of our princess. Im not with them any more but thats not the point. Be patient and picky. Youll find your own and bring your video game crush to reality. "

If hylians are aryan,I think the master sword was NOT a coincidence. 

Or just hylian. Way to jump right into the hitler joke."
