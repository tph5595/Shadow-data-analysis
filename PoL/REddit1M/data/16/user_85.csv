57046,In the early game sell ores and buy everything Beedle has. Mid game you'll slow down on selling ore to use them for upgrades. Cook meat dishes and sell them to make up for the lost cash flow.

The amber earrings are my favorite of the bunch because I don't like wear the hood/helm the whole time. (That, and it has the same defense as the helm.) I'm trying to up the diamond circlet but every time I get a star piece my amiibo sets just miraculously absorb each and every one. I need them all at max!"

The whole ganon fight was a very odd design decision. I could have sworn they said that the team had played the game multiple times before release. Did they really feel that having just ONE difficult phase (assuming all dungeons complete here) which is when calamity Ganon goes orange was enough? I'm starting to have doubts about one of my favorite game developers and that's just a huge disappointment.

Defeating each boss brings Ganons difficulty down to that of a victory-lap boss, with Beast Ganon being a sort of secondary even easier victory-lap boss. It just doesn't make sense to throw all the greatest weapons in the game at players and expect them not to absolutely obliterate Ganon within 5 minutes.

Another thing which just blows my mind is that they have enemies which are more difficult than Ganon in the game. Now this would be alright if they were some rare, secret boss-type monster. But they're not. They're everywhere. The Lynels are more difficult/dangerous than Ganon and even they are easy.

Love the game, can't stop playing it. Just completely disappointed with the ending that I've been waiting years to experience."
