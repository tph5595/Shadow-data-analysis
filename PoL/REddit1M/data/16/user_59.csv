30914,"I actually did the same thing haha, except that I figured by going to Mt Lanayru I'd have a good shot of finding the next memory (since one of the pictures was taken at a spring, I thought that would be the one).

Came across the dragon, this was also the first one of them that I'd seen and I had no idea wtf was going on. Thought it was the craziest, coolest thing ever."
31643,"My take on this is that when she unlocked her powers (or at least from the moment she decided to fully use them to face Ganon) she temporarily ascended into some kind of immortal spirit form, or incarnation of Hylia. Notice how she can hear Fi talking (Fi being a creation of Hylia herself) after unlocking her power in the final memory.

I also noticed that she doesn't actually seem to have a physical body in the present until after she comes out once you've defeated dark beast Ganon, and even then she looks otherworldy as she seals him away.

Also, in the true ending, she talks about how she can no longer hear the voice in the sword. Presumably, having served her purpose, she's lost her goddess-like power and will continue aging normally from now on."
57940,"I actually ended up liking her voice, sure the delivery could've been a tiny bit better in some scenes but overall I think it's a fitting accent for someone raised in a royal family. I also thought the king's voice was pretty decent overall.

The game has pretty good variation imo, with characters like Daruk and Revali (and the other Rito guy) sounding a bit more American with Zelda, Mipha, the King and others sounding a little more British.

I much prefer this variation to what the alternative could have been. I recently stumbled across a few of ZeldaUniverse's fan dubs for Twilight Princess and almost every voice actor, while not bad in delivery, is jarringly American. I'd much prefer English Zelda over American Zelda. I think it suits her, even though the delivery isn't always perfect."
