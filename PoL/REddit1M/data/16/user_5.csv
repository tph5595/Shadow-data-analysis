1423,"I suggest exploring, completing a few shrines, and practicing combat techniques like dodging and parrying on low-level enemies. Enemies get tougher as you play longer, so it's nice to get the hang of things early on, and a few late-game enemies will require you to know how to dodge and parry. The dungeon isn't going anywhere, so you might as well take care of some of the simpler things first. "
1572,"[SPOILERS FOR THE ENDING] Any idea how Zelda survived for 100 years without aging? Are there any clues or is it just ""magic"" with no explanation?"
3830,"Most materials are used for something, other than super common stuff like apples. You don't need to hoard the common stuff though, since it's easy to replenish. 

Bokoblin bits are totally disposable. You need them for a few things, but you'll never run out. They're everywhere and you'll always be fighting them. Feel free to sell them. 

Amber is used to upgrade a few optional armor pieces late in the game (this is true for all gemstones), but it's also pretty common by gemstone standards so selling it early on isn't a big deal as long as you're ok hunting down ore later on. You won't need any for a while, and there are lots of ways to farm ore once you have better gear. 

If you're concerned about running out of materials, food is a good way to make money. If you can find a source of premium meat, cook five of them together. It sells for a few hundred rupees. "
4350,"This is the explanation I'm going with. She sealed both of them away while Ganon was in that cocoon, effectively freezing their physical forms in time. Meanwhile, their minds continued to fight. The situation was probably similar to Link in the Shrine of Resurrection but without the healing or amnesia and with more psychic battles. I imagine the official explanation will be something similar. 

Girl's gotta have some serious PTSD after all that. She deserves a vacation. 

Edit: typo"
6486,"They do not, sorry. "
6888,"I was genuinely shocked that she was alive. I expected her to be dead like all the champions, especially since she's communicating psychically like they do and she'd be 117 years old by now. It's not like this series has a problem with sad or bittersweet endings, after all. It's practically a tradition. 

All things considered, this is probably one of the more cheerful endings to a Zelda game. 

I really hope the DLC takes place after the main game so we can get more adventures with these two. I know that's extremely unlikely for a variety of reasons, but I can still hope. "
10442,The other champions were still able to pilot the divine beasts and give you magical help. Even the king was able to keep interacting with the world after death. Why would she be any different? 
10917,"Some of the races seem to have very long lifespans (especially Zora and Sheikah) but the elderly Hylians you meet (like the old lady in Hateno) are all younger than 100. Their lifespans seem to be similar to humans. Meanwhile, Zelda doesn't age a day. I'm gonna have to assume that her sealing magic preserved her body in a kind of stasis and kept her from aging. "
11126,You mean they didn't want a tiny old Zelda to match Impa? That would have been an interesting sight. 
56338,"It's extremely unlikely for two reasons. A plot reason and a practicality reason. 

Plot reason: Ganon is the only reason that the world is filled with so many respawning monsters. With him gone, there should be far fewer monsters and monster camps around, and no evil guardians, Ganon corruption, or silver enemies at all. You'd have to rework the environments and come up with new enemies or create a convincing plot reason to keep the old enemies around. 

Practicality reason: the entire Hyrule Castle area changes after the fight, quite dramatically since the castle is totally wrecked in the battle. That's a lot of extra work to rework and remodel the area. All the regions and most of the characters would need new dialogue to reflect that Ganon is dead and peace has returned, which is a ton of work. 

The obvious solution is to create a new area and set the DLC there, but that could be just as much work as re-working existing areas. It's far simpler to just set it in the middle of the game. 

The biggest hurdle is that it requires players to beat the game before they can play the DLC, which is extremely uncommon in open world games because it creates a huge barrier and time commitment to overcome before players can enjoy the content they paid for. People just wanna play with the stuff they bought without having to go through dozens of hours of the game first. 

If the DLC is set mid-game instead of after the ending it would be a lot less work, make more sense in-universe, be more accessible, and match how other games tend to do things. It just makes more sense. 

As much as I would love some post-game DLC, I know it's just a lot harder and more complicated to create, so it probably won't happen. "
56794,"Yeah. Sometimes he can come back on his own, and sometimes he needs help. He would need help to come back after BoTW because he spent all his energy (meaning he's effectively dead) but it's technically possible. "
56894,I love it. I feel like we can apply this to a lot of stuff in the series.
