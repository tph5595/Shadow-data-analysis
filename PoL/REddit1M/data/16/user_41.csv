**The good:**

Exploration

Climbing and Gliding

Open World Design

Combat

Blank starting map

World bosses (Lynels)

Koroks

The Lost Woods

Hyrule Castle

Divine Beast Dungeons

Wide range of armor sets

Horses

Guardian design

Captured that original Zelda feeling

Shrine Quests

Artwork

Sound Design

Weapon Variety


**The so-so:**

Shrines (Some are great, some are not)

Weapon Durability (Some love it, some hate it)

Inventory Management

Cooking

Voice Acting (Some great, some bad)

Story characterization

No real memorable soundtracks


**The bad:**

Ganon fight

Dungeon boss fights

Not much story plot

No large, classic Zelda dungeons

However, I do find that the Hyrule Castle Theme and the Main Title theme / Kass's song are stuck in my head.

Yeah, those were great. The closest to a memorable soundtrack moment for me was the theme at the title drop at the beginning. 

The build up and reveal in the opening of the game is brilliant and really got me into enjoying this game right at the start. It felt like a Bethesda opening, and I'm sure that's no coincidence.

Here's the BOTW theme in case someone wants a listen. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPWBG6_jn4Y"
