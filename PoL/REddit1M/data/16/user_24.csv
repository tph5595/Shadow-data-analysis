12610,"So my master sword ""broke"" during Thunderblight Ganon (had to swap to a new weapon on the final hit to kill him).  I didn't think that was possible.  I only used the sword in the dungeon (it was glowing the whole time)."
21137,I'm going to say that the durability system is out of whack if the in game lore and the in game mechanics are at odds.
21331,"The game really ended on a whimper for me.  I honestly don't have any desire to even hit 20% completion, much less 100.  Every major boss in the game being some form of Ganon was kind of blah for me, too."
21506,"For the life of me I don't understand why people think this game is somehow different from all the other open world games.  It still has map towers, crafting, and collect-a-thons."
24827,"I don't think that explanation works when you consider that the attack power of the Master Sword doubles when in the presence of Ganon's energy.  I guess it's the  ""sword to seal evil (until it breaks, then just use any other weapon in your inventory to seal evil)."""
33495,"I like that idea, but I would take it a step further.  Give it a gradual permanent power increase with each divine beast cleared (due to some sort of spiritual power infusion gained from releasing a champion).  When all four are cleared, you have a permanent full power unbreakable Master Sword.  I think it would actually live up to its moniker then.  The downside is that since it's an open world game, that you could potentially clear all four shrines without even having the Master Sword, so that would be difficult to sequence."
58335,"And nothing would stop you from doing just that.  I argue that fear of weapon breaking actually prevents using a variety of weapons.  When the credits rolled, I had an inventory full of cool weapons that I never used because I didn't want to break them."
