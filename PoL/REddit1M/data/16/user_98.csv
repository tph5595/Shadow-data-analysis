80025,"It's not before Wind Waker. Its referenced several times that Skyward Sword and Ocarina (and depending if you want to or not, Memory #1 with Twilight Princess) happen prior to this. In fact, the Wind Waker timeline CANNOT HAPPEN until after the battle with Ganondorf in Ocarina to create the Adult timeline. "
80138,"No. Taking Wind Waker as the example, Ganondorf reigned because there was no hero courageous enough to stop Ganon. If you recall talking to the NPCs, they have numbed themselves to the Blood Moon and Ganon at the Castle. They accept it and move on. So, no for this one. In addition, if you recall in Wind Waker, people thought that and waited for the Hero of Time but he never showed up which led to the Great Flood. "
80792,"Officially, no one has confirmed anything yet. Some have pointed to the Child and Adult timelines as the main ones and evidence keeps going back and forth.

As for the Twilight Princess line, in Memory #1, Princess Zelda says to Link 'Whether skyward bound, adrift in time, or steeped in the glowing embers of twilightâ€¦' Those are direct references to Skyward Sword (among Memory I think #13 that has the Sword talk to Zelda), Ocarina of Time (also lost songs in time from the Rito Kass and his accordion), and Twilight Princess. 

For sure though, if it is in the Wind Waker timeline, it cannot happen prior to that game as you have to have Ocarina happen to break the timeline, which they know of the legend here. Ocarina of Time has to happen to make anything work, which, in Wind Waker's case, cant as Ganondorf did not attack against till the time of Wind Waker."
81096,"I clarified it because nothing can happen prior to Ocarina unless it's specifically outright stated, like Skyward Sword. Something cant be referenced and then made before. Twilight Princess is one of those cases that difficult but Skyward and Ocarina happen in all timelines. Theres only a short time in between Ocarina and Wind Waker, so a 10,100 gap is not possible."
81520,"No, it can't take place between the two. Reason is this: the Hero of Time was missing after the events of the Ocarina of Time battle with Ganondorf and the Adult timeline. The Hero of Time did not come about again until Wind Waker. So there's absolutely no way it could happen.

In addition, just because Rito and Koroks exist doesnt mean they didnt exist prior. We might have not encountered them.  Youre also forgetting that, if I recall correctly, Zoras, Gorons, and Gerudo were all extinct by the events of Wind Waker. You can't just magically make a race appear again when its extinct. 

Some people are thinking its a convergence but also leaning towards the Child timeline. Wind Waker has references but is third in the theories at the moment. 

In short, it cant be inbetween Ocarina and WW as there was no Hero in Time during those periods, hence Ganondorf's return."
81783,"It's mentioned in the Historia and in the game that the events of Wind Waker take place several generations after Ocarina. The average age of a generation is 25 - 30 years. So, for 10000 years, lets go with 30 for this, that's 333 generations roughly. WAY too long after Ocarina. 

Even with it being an ancient legend, the entire purpose and existence of WW is because you have a Hero of Time missing. You cant have one missing and then have him at the same time. You also cant have it before Ocarina because Ganondorf wasnt 'defeated' until his first true appearance, which was Ocarina."
82414,"A. You brought it up as you said it was before WW.

B. Because it cant be. You cant mention something happening in game and then say something happened before. Case in point, specifically for Skyward Sword and Ocarina. It cant happen before Skyward Sword because you see the Sword talk to Zelda. That's in game and references Fi. That was also the Origin Story. So it HAS to take place after that.

C. For Ocarina of Time, the timeline split does not occur until the confrontation with Ganondorf. Ganondorf was not faced for the first time till the events of Ocarina. Zelda mentioned, in game, that he became Calamity Ganon due to his numerous defeats. So you cant have faced him prior as Ocarina is the FIRST TIME.

D. You cant have songs that were guarded by the royal family be just legend and stories if it happened prior, as some of the songs were HEAVILY guarded. It would have to be past events.

E. Ganondorf did not become Ganon until the events of Ocarina of Time. http://kotaku.com/5871215/the-official-zelda-timeline-now-with-added-detail

So, it has to take place after the events of Ocarina. And theres more than enough in story elements to say why, if its the Child storyline, it has to take place after TP. Furthermore, if its in WW, it has to take place after Spirit Tracks as the Hero of Time doesnt emerge until the events of WW."
82593,"Btw, I will state that's not me being mean (I noticed your sarcasm /s). My prior long paragraph comment has in game reasons why it cannot be. It would be one thing if this was fan theory. However, this is all stated in game."
