50275,"I was wondering about the big gaping plot in in that they decided to stick Link in a bathtub for 100 yeas.

Link is reincarnated over and over. And everyone in the plot knows this. Hyrule and everyone in it would have been 82 years better off if they just let him die.

Its not like they were helping Hyrule by keeping a Link who knew how to fight Ganon, because he didn't and they all knew he would lose his memories. Was there some importance to it having to be exactly 100 years later that I missed?"
50614,"So thats Fi in the Master Sword right? The voice in the sword? In the last memory, its makes the sound effect it makes when Fi has a message for you.

Really odd to include that, since the voice in the sword amounted to nothing, and Fi hasnt been anywhere in Zelda since chronologically the first one. 

But why the heck was the voice in the sword the very last thing mentioned in the game? Why is it mentioned at all when you never hear it?"

106304,"Well I don't think it was as Zelda-centric as Spirit Tracks, the one game where Zelda is actually the companion character and you play as her."
106469,"I beat Ganon with only 3 divine beasts, as it became painfully apparent that it was going to be a cakewalk. I hoped that missing that chunk of the game would have given me some sort of challenge.

And having done even that I know I would have absolutely slaughtered him with 0 divine beasts. Keeping in mind that you have to additionally fight every Divine Beast boss you missed right before Calamity Ganon as well."
