10153,"I do agree to an extent, but in it's defense, korok seeds and shrines are more of a puzzle based mini game, each korok and shrine are either hidden or need some puzzle solving to get- and they're optional (somewhat). I really do wish there was an achievement system in the game/console, but maybe thats just the Steam/console gamer in me- I just like looking at achievements and feeling accomplished after getting them.

I am currently playing Ghost recon wildlands and I am getting so sick of it. Go here to this AI infested area, kill them all, steal a truck and deliver it here, etc. it only is made worse in wildlands because of the game terrain. Massive mountains and forests that you can't traverse around unless you have a helicopter, so I understand your Ubisoft sentiment haha"
