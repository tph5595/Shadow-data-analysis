For the Zoras it was a whole ordeal to make it up Zora River to the Domain, THEN you needed to collect the lightning arrows, disable Vah Ruto, make your way through. And then afterward there was immense payoff when the Zoras eventually accepted you.

There was no payoff and barely any build-up for Vah Medoh. I really wonder how Nintendo could have neglected that one segment of the game so badly."
