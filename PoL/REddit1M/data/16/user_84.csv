56124,"I just beat it tonight, but yeah I felt that too. Visually it was awesome. I think that is the best version of beast Ganon we've seen, but it definitely was kind of a walk in the park. I one shot both bosses without issue. The Moblin's on Death Mountain posed a bigger threat to me. Tough honestly none of the Ganon bosses felt that hard to me. Even the very first one I did, without the Master Sword, felt like he went down with little trouble. I figure that was on purpose. While the combat could be punishing I don't think they wanted the bosses to be a wall that stopped people from playing the game. "
