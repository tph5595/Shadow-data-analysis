36421,"So I just beat Ganon, after taking as many detours as I could.

For the first 10-20 hours I thought this was the best game ever made. The world was not only huge, but incredibly detailed and full of surprises. It seemed to blow all previous Zeldas out of the water. It helps that the Zora quest, which you're encouraged to do first, is by far the best of the 4, both in terms of story and gameplay.

As the game went on I never stopped loving it, but a few flaws became apparent. One is enemy variety. At first it felt like I never knew what kind of battles each new area would hold. Eventually that stopped being the case, and exploration became a tad less exciting as a result. The story also left me wanting more. Zelda had character development, but no one else did, and the Champions appear in like 2-3 cutscenes each. The ending didn't really satisfy me.

I'll have to let it sink in for a while before I can decide how this compares to previous Zeldas. The flaws are pretty minor compared to what it does right... and it gets so much right that no previous Zelda game has. I'd also love it if the DLC addressed the flaws, but I highly doubt it."
