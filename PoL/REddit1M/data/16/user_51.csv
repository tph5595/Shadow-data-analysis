So after reading this comment, I figured since I'd fully upgraded my armor, had the Master Sword, the Hylian shield, and plenty of Ancient Arrows, why not? I can take a few Guardians. I get there, and instantly see them all light up, and just noped right through there to get to the shrine. What a nightmare."
