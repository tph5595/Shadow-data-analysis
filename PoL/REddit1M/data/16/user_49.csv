21666,"I realized exactly that after I tried to play SS and TP over the last few days ""just to see"", and while I appreciate their stories on paper I just don't know if I can go back to the Wii era of Zelda any time soon. I felt so confined in the game after coming from the freedom in BOTW, and boy is there a lot of unskippable dialogue and cutscenes in those two games. "
21788,build so many camp fires
21900,"to be fair the Master Sword has lost its strength in the past e.g WW/TP, so maybe the blight of Calamity Ganon is hampering its connection to the source of its power and has to build up energy after heavy usage"
21957,I actually reloaded an older save after I beat Vah Ruta and realized that beam would persist. 
22096,"I keep imagining how great this game world would be with dungeons like Arbiter's Grounds, or The Shadow Temple"
31210,Yeah it really does come down to a balancing issue. What would have been a neat solution IMO would be for the Master Sword as you find it to be a rusty low level weapon BUT it would be unbreakable. Then when in the prescence of Ganon or inside the Shrines it is powered up to its full divine form. 
35786,Maybe tie it to number of shrines as well as beasts to get the full powered sword? 
50403,"It honestly shouldn't really be a big deal having the dungeons be able to be completed out of order either. The races are all being affected independently from one another, so any forced sequence is basically arbitrary, and BOTW has proven that players are more than capable of just jumping in and hitting the ground running.
