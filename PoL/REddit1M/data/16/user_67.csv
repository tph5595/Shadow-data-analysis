40113,"I've been having a blast with BotW, and I agree with pretty much everything you say. 

On dungeon boss fights - while I thought that they were not as creatively varied, I thought they fit well into the overall dungeons, and I found they challenged my combat skills appropriately. 

On No real memorable soundtracks - I was hoping there would be an overworld theme, or perhaps regional themes (Hebra, Woodland, Faron, etc.) and was disappointed that there were not. However, I do find that the Hyrule Castle Theme and the Main Title theme / Kass's song are stuck in my head. 

On Inventory Management - I kinda wish they had kept with the circular inventory arrangement of TP and SS, but understand that with 30+ weapons that it can get cumbersome even that way. 

Some of my friends ask me how BotW is and how it compares to past Zelda games, and I try to tell them it's a great game overall, and that it is especially great on what it focused on.  I appreciate that they have focused on different aspects for different games, rather than trying to reproduce or surpass the same experience each time. This makes me want to go back (after I'm done with BotW, not now of course) and play Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and Skyward Sword for their strengths that BotW may have not done so hot in.  And I'm okay with that, as I'll come back to BotW when I want for its strengths too. "
