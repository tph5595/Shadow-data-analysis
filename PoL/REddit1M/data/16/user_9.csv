2859,"It's not explained, feel free to theorize. But yeah most reasonable explanation would be because she was sealed with Ganon.

But if you ask pragmatic me I think it's just because they didn't want an old Zelda."
10326,I keep seeing people mentionning that they thought she was dead but how would that even work ? Isn't she supposed to be the one preventing Ganon from destroying Hyrule by holding him during the whole game and the 100 years before ?
11346,"I didn't consider that to be fair. I saw their interactions with the world as rather limited, not as ""can fight with evil even through death""."
11525,"I was thinking that they would have to put a lot of work into a new model and find a second VA who sounded like the first one but old (though given the old people's VAs I guess they wouldn't even have tried to find that), all for one minute of footage.

EDIT : Also I just remembered, in-universe if Zelda ended up 117 years old Hyrule would be doomed if Ganon showed up again."

Where do you live ? Because I'm pretty sure in most of the world most humans live longer than 65."
24886,"[In France, where life expectancy is 82.4 years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_life_expectancy)"
55768,"&gt; Worldwide, the average life expectancy at birth was 71.0 years

On the same page.

If most people have a life expectancy of more than 65 years, making it past 65 is definely not ""lucky""."
55969,"I guess that's what it would mean, yeah."
56744,"They gave me my usual horse, and it seems to be that way for most people.dunno why it didn't work for you."
64148,You have to face the blights before Ganon if you don't free the divine beasts tho.
