14006,"Definitely, I liked the first phase and thought the difficulty was good for phase 1 boss fight. Cinematically, the beast form was really cool and I was pumped to have a horseback segment but it fell flat when I realized he never even aimed at you. Afterwards, I was ready for a phase 3 and then the game just...ended. Given the emphasis on climbing in this game, I hoped to have to climb the beast form at some point after getting close enough on horseback. I understand that its a mechanic that has been done before, but it still would have been cool. 

Overall, I was expecting one of those hour and a half long boss fights and it turned out to be pretty short and not that difficult. Side note, did anyone try to run away during the second phase of the boss fight? It looked like the map was left open but I just wanted to finish the game. "
