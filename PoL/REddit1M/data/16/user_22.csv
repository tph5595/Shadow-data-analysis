11357,"I think it's the first game I ever played where I *really* feel like the reward is adventure itself. All those side quests, those climbing on mountains in the middle of nowhere, these explorations, I'm just so happy to do them. And I'm just happy that there is at least something. I never feel like I'm grinding in this game, I'm just doing whatever I feel like doing, when I feel like doing it, and it's an absolute pleasure. It's so great to ask myself ""what do I want to do ?"" And not ""what do I need to do ?""

I hope more games will go toward that direction because I'm tired of doing things for in-game rewards. I want to do then because it's pure fun to do them."
