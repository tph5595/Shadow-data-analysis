24973,"I think the unscripted adventures in this game are what make it so wonderful. I found one of Zelda's memories while doing a quest to find a royal steed, and in that memory she mentioned how she would like to climb to a spring on a mountain when she turns 17, the Spring of Wisdom or some such. 

So, I decided to climb the mountain she mentioned and find the spring. It wasn't a quest or anything, but I figured out where she was talking about and went to check it out. Well, imagine my surprise and delight when I found not only the spring but also a dragon corrupted by Ganon. One pretty cool mini-boss fight later I use a dragon scale to open up a hidden shrine at the peak of the mountain. 

I love open world games but get so fatigued by the pile of icons and side quests, but in this game I find that the most fun is when I simply pick a direction or landmark and head off to explore. I often spot a challenge, realize I need to find food/weapons to beat said challenge, then spiral off into a 1-2 hour loop of finding some other distraction while finding the ingredients to help with the first distraction and so on and on.
