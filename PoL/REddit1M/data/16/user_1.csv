705,Where to go first after unlocking the first memory (the one at east gate of lanayru) should I explore or go straight for the first divine beast?
1627,Thanks for the solid advice! One last question. Is there anything I shouldn't sell besides the ancient stuff. Are the ambers and bokoblin horn/fangs and other things used in late game?
