7494,I agree. The grinding of Shrines and Korok Seeds in the open world reminded me of how much I hate Ubisoft open world games. AND I HATE UBISOFT OPEN WORLD GAMES. They always have you doing the same crap with slight and very minor variations to power up. I would have much rather preferred the Zelda team have left the heart containers in side quests and chests in the open world like the original games. Instead we only need to find shrines and obtain spirit orbs to get heart containers. It was kind of a disappointment for me that they did it that way with shrines to be honest.

22063,I live in the real world where people smoke drink and depress themselves to death. Where do you live? Hahaha
