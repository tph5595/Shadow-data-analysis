42289,It was some random horse too. I only stabled one horse and that certainly wasn't Dildopolis at the end.
44820,"While trying to break the formulas of old games, they just ended up creating entirely new predictable formulas (i.e. 4 nearly identical mini dungeons where a sassy character that helps you inside, where you meet another sassy ghost character of the same race, search for 6 buttons to press, and fight a mini ganon who has an A fighting style and starts B fighting style at exactly 50% health).  

So as I progressed through the game I became less and less enchanted with it as the formulas became apparent.  Oh, Im approaching a fire area? I better find some fire clothes.  I guess I'll encounter fire moblins, fire keese, and fire jellies in this part of the map. Look! They're giving me fire weapons.

The first 30 hours of game play were epic and awesome while I explored the whole world and I didn't even mind the first 60 shrines (except for the ridiculous ones that needed the WiiU game pad). The last 10 hours were a little boring as I grinded the last 2 dungeons and beefed up my stats for the ganon fight, which also was somewhat underwhelming. The 2nd form just stood there while I shot arrows at it. Wtf Nintendo? "

I prefered this subtle approach to story telling than Skyward Sword where the plot was hammered into you with  forced back stories and relentless development of minor characters.

But agree 100% that the Ganon fight sucked."
