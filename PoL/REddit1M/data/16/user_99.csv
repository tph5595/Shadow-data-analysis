And another reason:
Ganon in BotW already lost his humanity and human form Ganondorf. But in Wind Waker he's only Ganondorf without his beastly form Ganon."
374074,Yeah... and you could do nothing because there wouldn't be enemies anymore for farming...
374168,But what would you do? The world would be empty without enemies and all... how would you farm items and all? It would make everything worse.
