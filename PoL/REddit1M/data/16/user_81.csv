Edit: after the first ending with the champions and the king looking at Zelda there is an additional scene if you finish the captured memories quest."
54423,Think of all of the other open world games where there is actually nothing when you climb something tall or do something cool.  This game is INSANE and it sets the bar so high for the open world games that follow.
55055,But then the only weapon you would ever use is the master sword!  I think it's so fun to get into a huge fight and toss a boomerang at a group of enemies and while they chase me throw a spear into ones face and hack the others with a spin attack.
57182,I'd say most of your points are valid but they could very easily make a post game dark world segment where it's basically the same world but with new monsters and items.  They could lore it as the place Ganon went after banishment from Hyrule; Link and Zelda could go to finish him off for good thus placing the game in the non resurrection timeline.
