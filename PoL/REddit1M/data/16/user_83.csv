54261,Where does this game fall on the timeline? My guess is before Wind Waker. 
80339,"There's a memory confirming this is part of the TP line? So it takes place tens of thousands of years after Four Swords Adventures?

Edit: I never said WW was the first game, I don't know why you're clarifying it like I don't know the timeline. "
81185,"It could take place between OoT and WW, there's no confirmed length of time between them. If I had meant before OoT or SS, I would have said so. The existence of the Rito and Koroks and presence of the Goron and Zora are what make me think this is the bridge between OoT and WW as opposed to being part of any other timeline. The TP reference would then not make sense, but if it's part of child Link's split the existence of Ritos and Koroks doesn't make sense. 

But if there is no official place yet, I won't worry about it. "
81512,"Where is the short time mentioned? I've played WW countless times and don't ever remember there being a set amount of time between them. 

Actually, event then the Hero of Time is an ancient legend. "
82050,"Nope. Since everyone keeps telling me it can't be before OoT, I'm now convinced it's before OoT. /s

Seriously. Why the fuck does it keep being brought up?"
