23567,"TBH, even though Nintendo intended for players to play the game at whatever pace and whatever order they choose to, I think they still intended for players to go through the beasts in the same order as the temples in traditional Zelda games. I keep reading about how easy people thought the Rito quests were compared to others and how people would always go through the Zora quests first because the Zora's Domain is closest to Kakariko Village.

Early on, I decided that I would do the beasts in the same order as temples (forest/wind, volcano, water, sand). I felt that the escalation of difficulty was just right. plus, the most usefull ability for exploring is the Revali's Gale. It only makes sense to get that one first before having to explore majority of the map."
