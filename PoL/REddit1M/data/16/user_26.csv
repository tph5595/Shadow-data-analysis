13183,"Only **441** Korok seeds are used to fully max out inventory stash, and **459** left unused. It would be great if we could use those left over seeds to buy things that the Amiibos give, especially the old link outfits/weapons. No way getting the older Amiibos without dishing $80 for out-of-print ones, unless you spoof them.

*edit* - I actually don't know how much Korok Seeds you need to MAX out stash, I'm just going by a thread image that happens to show the extra seeds in their inventory, Sorry about that ):"
