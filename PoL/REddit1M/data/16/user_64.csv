Maybe setup a bazaar in the castle, sort of like how we had in OoT as younger Link. I hate that after all that work to reach and defeat the final boss, we can't experience what Hyrule is like without Ganon. I'd love to explore the beautiful world they've created and every so often glance at the Castle and all its glory. Maybe even go inside. Link could even setup a little area in the Castle and sell recipes."

38124,Tell me about it. Those beams suck. And it also bugs me that we can't save and experience the game after defeating Ganon. I want to explore Hyrule Castle without all that chaos surrounding it.
