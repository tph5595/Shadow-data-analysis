7373,"Was anyone else a little underwhelmed by the Ganon fight at the end? I prepared so much food for that battle and had my armor all upgraded to two stars thinking it would be a real struggle. But in reality, I only got hit maybe once. It just felt too easy. Fighting a lynel felt harder. "
21988,"Yeah, Daruks protection and also Urbosa's fury really turned that battle into easy mode. I think once he went into the invulnerable mode I used urbosas fury three times, went up and attacked him and then backed off. Three times and he was done. "
22072,"Yeah, that second part was the easiest boss I have ever fought. He barely even aims at you! And plus they give you a horse."
22375,"Agreed. I was honestly confused at first. You go to the flight range and the Rito there is just like, ""you wanna take down this beast? alright let's go."" Wtf? Although being able to fly around in the air with unlimited stamina was fun."
