17164,"Within the Zelda options there are no language options that I can find.

Within the Switch options, all I can find changes the language of the entire console to Japanese etc. which changes the in-game text (including subtitles and menu text) to Japanese, which doesn't seem to be what OP wants.

Is there somewhere else to look?"
17269,Have you found Naydra yet? 
18442,"Naydra is the Lanayru region dragon. I'm not 100% certain, but I believe that you have to go find Naydra before the other dragons start consistently spawning. "

20794,"What I mean is the consistent ""Every day at XX:XX Farosh will appear at Y location"" spawning, as well as being able to farm things other than scales.

I think that the game will randomly generage the dragons in the early game, so you see them every so often and it gives you a ""holy shit!"" moment. So the game intends for you to decide to investigate; then some people in Hateno tell you about the blue dragon Naydra. So you go find Naydra, and Naydra walks you through getting and using the scale for its intended purpose. Then you're inspired to go find the other dragons and use their scales for their intended purpose, so the game starts spawning them at the consistent times.

That's my current hypothesis, but it's hard to confirm or falsify without playing through the game multiple times myself. However, there are a number of players who don't follow that line, and instead get to upgrading their Champion's Tunic, eventually requiring Farosh's Horn, and so go to seek out Farosh without ever finding Naydra. If my hypothesis is correct, then it explains why they either can't get consistent spawning, or can't get a Horn to drop. "
29512,"I'm talking about *consistently* spawning, as in ""Every day at XX:XX time, Farosh spawns at Y location."" See my other reply for a more detailed explanation."
