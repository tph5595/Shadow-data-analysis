8797,"Hmm, I disagree.  I felt like Twilight Princess had a perfect amount of content on the field.  There were lots of mini-dungeons hidden around the place - some were actually pretty big (I'm thinking about the giant cave with lava that used the iron boots/magnetism mechanic), and a pretty good distribution of enemies scattered around.

In fact, I think if it had much more stuff to do, it would have lost the sense of vastness: it doesn't feel like you're travelling across a huge plain if you stop every 15 seconds to jump down a hole or kill an enemy."
