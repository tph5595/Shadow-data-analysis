I think the thing I want most from Zelda U is an economy. They got slightly better at this with SS, bur Zelda's economy in general is still pretty laughable. Something I respect about games like Skyrim and Dragon Age is that you will *always* need your money. There's always stuff to spend it on. Sure, if you overlevel enough and exploit things, money can become trivial (like in Skyrim) but it's hard for that to happen if you're just playing through it naturally."

I remember looting everything on every quest and selling it all, but I would still run out of money buying better swords, armor, etc. Not to mention the weight capacity limit prevented me from collecting all the loot in the world. The point is that there's always stuff to buy that can be used. You can buy better weapons and armor, or if you're more savvy, you can buy crafting tools to *make* better weapons and armor. There's spells to buy, jewelery and gemstones to buy, horses, houses, people that will teach you skills, the list goes on. Even if you can exploit the system by looting everything you see and reselling it, a player who's not actively trying to break the economy will typically always have a reason to keep whatever money they find, instead of Zelda, where rupees become trivial halfway through the game in most cases."
