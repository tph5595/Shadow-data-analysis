1034,"I actually didn't mind the way they implemented motion controls in WWHD. If they use that system I won't complain at all. That said, it would be nice if they give us a choice again, between motion assisted aiming with the Gamepad or a more classic control scheme with the Pro controller "
9193,"I absolutely agree, one of the huge turn offs for me in SS was the 1 to 1 motion controls. But in my opinion, having the motion controls on top of the joystick controls for aiming, using the telescope, ect.. was a fantastic touch in both OoT 3D and WWHD. I hope to see that system back in Zelda U, and if I had to guess, it will return in the new game, since it was used in both the previous two releases (with the exception of Link Between Worlds.) As long as it's optional like it was in the previous two 3D games, I think that's the best way to do it."
9282,"Right, which IMO is the best way to do it. I loved the Hybrid motion control in WWHD and OoT3D but giving the player the choice is I think, the best option."
16359,"I absolutely agree, I think that's why I liked WW motion controls so much, it felt less like a gimmick and more like it actually added to the game, so here's hoping they keep with that trend!"
16425,"I completely agree, it's starting to feel less forced into the gameplay and is actually starting to complement the gameplay. So let's hope they keep with that trend."
