8380,"I don't really know how much water your ""open world"" complaint holds after seeing the video.  However, I'm disappointed about the textures I saw.  They looked pretty stretched and low-res at one point.  And as we all know, devs (although probably not Nintendo devs) typically only show off the good graphics in the teaser.

But who the hell cares, it's a new Zelda game.  Sub-par textures don't compare to the kind of gameplay we've seen over the years.  Hail Aonuma!"
