0,"AKA just a general discussion for what do you not want to see. 

For me it is that the open world, won't be that open. It will just be really big, with long linear paths from place to place without much exploration opportunity and a feeling of emptiness. As well as it won't be challenging enough and the bosses won't be that creative or hard, like in Skyward Sword.

Still really excited though!
