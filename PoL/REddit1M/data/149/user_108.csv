Twilight Princess, while some may not like the game, was delayed a whole year and as a result, to me at least, it felt like a very complete grand adventure

With Zelda U having such a large overworld, I'm a bit worried It will be lacking content. This has the potential to be the largest and best Zelda game ever, so I really want them to get it right. I wouldn't mind a delay as long as the end game is very good."
