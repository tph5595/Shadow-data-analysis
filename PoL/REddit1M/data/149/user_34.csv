6317,"i want more creative/elaborate caves and dungeons. i dont want to walk into a room and spend 20 minutes looking for a simple marker to hit just to unlock the next door. Also creating hype that leads up to the boss would be nice. I also want more difficult enemies, and not just having to be patient and time attacks accordingly, its just a waiting game. I also hope that what ever instrument they tend to incorporate into the game plays a bigger roll than just opening shit like with the harp in SS. WW and OoT did this very well. I also cringe whenever I think of assistance/tips, the one is SS was so annoying, I think she was named Fi or something, so was Navi in Oot, but the assist in TP wasnt bad at all. The ladt thing I fear would be a failed attempt to use the vast world they have effectively. As some mentioned SS failed to use the vast sky to its full potential."
