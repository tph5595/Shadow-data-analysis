As much as I enjoy a nonlinear system, I felt that buying/renting your weapons and tools cheapened a lot of the dungeons and puzzles, and rather than making the world feel bigger, it just made the game feel a lot smaller.

One of the biggest problems with the latest generation of Pokemon, for example, is that it's set up in a way that's so easy there's barely any challenge to it, and while certain people might like that, for everyone else, it just makes it far to easy to play and beat, making playing the game at all pointless."
