10185,"One thing I saw as a step in the right direction with Skyward Sword is collectible variety. As in, to get upgrades you actually had to explore the world and find unique items, rather than just paying flat rupees. I hope we see 10x more of that in Zelda U. It has the potential to make random dungeons a lot more interesting, if you can find a larger variety of meaningful upgrade items. There would be more of an incentive to explore every nook and cranny, because in that random cave there could be an exclusive upgrade item that you can't find anywhere else."
