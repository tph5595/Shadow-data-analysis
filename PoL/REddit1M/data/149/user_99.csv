Skyward Sword and Twilight princes took too long to get into the gameplay.  TP was one hour to the first dungeon, SS was almost 2 hours.  I work 8-5, I don't have that kind of time.

I really do not wanna see a boss more than once.  You fight that one guy in SS three times, twice as a boss in dungeons that could've had otherwise interesting bosses.  

Motion controls, although wii u games are moving pretty far from that, so I doubt it'll be a problem."

There have been games where you face a rival of sorts multiple time throughout the game, but Zelda is a game that thrives on a variety of bosses and minibosses. In that second fire dungeon, people were lookin forward to some crazy fire boss with the same epic ness of the earlier Koloktos battle, but then...ghirahim disappointed us."

I quite enjoyed the last fight with him, and I do see your point with how his fights worked with the story progression, but did we really need two fights at the end of the dungeon.  OoT and ALBW had one fight with the final boss at an earlier point.  Well, OoT was technically phantom ganon, but it helped ""train"" you for the final fight.  LttP had two as well, or was it 3?

I guess multiple ghirahim's wasn't as bad as the three fights with the imprisoned... That added character development for Groose, though.  "
