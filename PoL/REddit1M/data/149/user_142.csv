This is really the one area where no voice acting hurts this series greatly.  If Fi's little informational bits were spoken aloud while you get to start running around and exploring the new area, she wouldn't be very annoying at all.  Instead, the player is forced to mash A while barely registering what she is saying.  It's quite unpleasant."
50632,"Well the problem there was that the reward for exploring those caves were almost always rupees.  They weren't very useful in that game.  I think I ended up putting the rupees back into at least half of those chests because my wallet was full.  Skyward Sword alleviated a bit since there are so many things you can use your rupees for.

Plus, the iron boots are my least favorite Zelda item of all time so your one example doesn't do anything for me."
50747,That was one of my biggest disappointments in TP.  It wasn't fun to screw around in Zora's Domain that time.

And the Ghirahim rematches were some of the most fun boss fight in the 3D Zeldas.  Story AND gameplay progression all rolled up together?  Sign me up for more of that."

51466,"It doesn't look like it will be forced.  WWHD had the gyroscope for any first person items (telescope, bow, boomerang, etc.), but using the right analog stick also controlled it."
51518,Uh...the first trailer was literally only exactly what you want.
51844,"There's not one person saying it this time so I will: I don't fear anything about Zelda U.  I'm sure I will enjoy it and I will try to keep my hype to manageable levels until I can experience it for myself.

The one thing I'm concerned about is the predictable negative reaction of the Zelda fanbase.  It pains me to see how petty and angry everyone gets about a game that should be loved.  And if you think it will be different this time, just take a look at this thread and you will know it to be true."
51945,Well memory is a fickle thing.  I recall seeing text but I'm not sure if it's just the chests or both.
95302,Disappointed *you*.  Don't project disappointment on the whole fanbase.  I enjoyed those fights.  
97940,I think the best solution would have been to have the Ghirahim fights separate from the dungeons.  But it took long enough for that game to be developed as is so I'm not sure I would change it.
