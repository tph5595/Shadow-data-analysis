440,I'll second that.  The preview video made me very afraid though as it looked like he was using motion with the gamepad to control the camera.
75420,"[Around the :35 second mark](http://youtu.be/SECWlFInyFM?t=35s)  not much but if they are using here I would imagine they use it elsewhere. 

Edit: And around the 2:30, it looks like he is looking around the same way, and maybe aiming slightly (not sure on that but he is moving the pad around and the screen is matching)."
