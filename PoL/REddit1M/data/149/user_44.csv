Just saying... If the new zelda is anything like a larger version of those then it will be pretty bad."

And I loved the vastness of Twilight Princess at the time it was released, nowadays all that emptiness won't fly though... Skyward sword definitely disappointed me there. At least twilight princess came out back with games like Shadow of the Colossus.

As long as Zelda U raises the bar a bit from Skyrim I'll be happy. Skyrim was a definitely too repetitive, but it's also the game I spend more time playing than any other game in my life so I obviously still loved it. Just don't want Another Skyrim at this point, somewhere in between skyrim and majoras mask would be amazing."

I guess I went in expecting the ""islands"" floating in the sky to be similar to the islands in wind waker, in number and quality... But really it was just empty space with a couple rocks."
13332,"Sorry I have an opinion that differs from yours. Skyward sword's art style combined with the Wii's SD output just gives me a headache on an HDTV. the first time I played it was on an older TV and I didn't think it was that bad, still didn't like it. But on a large LED 1080P screen it just looks bad."
