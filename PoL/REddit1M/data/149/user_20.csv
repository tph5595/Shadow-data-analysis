4214,"I hope Link become more of a manly figure, he keeps becoming more androgynous with each new game. That being said toon/young link are just kids so that really isn't applicable in their case. 

Edit: My favorite Hero of Time incarnation was either in Twilight Princess link or the Ocarina of Time Link(purely out of Nostalgia). In addition i didnt mind the Hyrule Warriors Link."
9070,You make a good point I didnt mean in the sense of making him like Marcus Fenix or other over the top masculine models. I have always loved the way link looks but ive noticed he tends to be effeminated as new titles are released. Tweeking a model is fine but to the degree that it is becoming I am less enthusastic about.
12131,I like this idea! Do they keep their original triforce pieces or are they swapped around? It seems to me that nintendo loves the hero of time to wield the triforce of courage almost in symbolic way.
