4714,"I would be perfectly happy with an epic original Zelda remake mixed with open-world exploration in the vein of Skyrim. I agree with everyone else in that I fear long travel times or relying on fast-travel due to a lack of reasons to justify exploring. Sure, there're the dungeons and the areas you can't reach until later, with items, but if I'm just walking along, I'll need NPCs, side quests and just plain rewards for looking inside caves or exploring open areas, such as battles and sweet sweet rupees.
