But besides that, yeah, I'm wary of developers who claim their game will be so massive and they deliver on the promise only to have had to cut out content in the middle to realize the size of their world.

Hopefully there will be some sort of events that randomly occur and don't necessarily matter if they're not done. For instance, I'd love a random ""Save the *insert group* from the monsters!"" type thing.

Another fear I have is hunger. To replace the annoying stamina bar, we'll instead get hunger which we must eat otherwise our ability starts sucking. I hope I'm just paranoid and it isn't a mechanic in this game because unless eating apples fills health, I see no point in it."
