No more missions like the ""tears of light"" or ""silent realm"". I don't want to replay those games SPECIFICALLY because of those missions.

Get rid of the stamina bar. Link should be able to run forever.

ALL cutscenes should be skippable. Once you beat the game there should be an option to automatically skip them all together.

Please scale the difficulty accordingly. Hero mode is a horrible answer - at the beginning everything kills you in one hit. Towards the end you barely even get hit, and even if you did, it's barey 1/10th your health. There should be moments when I'm facing a late game boss and I realize ""OMG I ONLY HAVE HALF A HEART LEFT"". Make it fair.
