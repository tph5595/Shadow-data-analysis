3751,"The overworld being empty and bland like TP and SS. 

The overworld having ""secrets"" like the original game that are completely undetectable. Please don't tell me I'm a baby... those were STUPID and you know it. At least have something nearby pointing, or hints from an NPC about it... 

Being way to easy, enemies should be like in Alttp/Albw. Taking 1 heart at the least, with the final boss hitting for 6-8 with basic tunics. 

It having more Rpg elements than just upgrading items. 
I swear if there's exp and grinding, I will not play it. I really don't like RPGs that much, and this would kill it for me. I feel like the light rpg elements Zelda has, and I feel like more will just turn this game into the Legend of Zelda: Skyrim, big and empty with 500 hours of fetch questing and grinding"
