33689,"My biggest fear is that it's a big open world...with nothing in it. Maybe I'm being pessimistic, but I don't expect a practically boundless world teeming with life. I expect what we say in the gameplay trailer: some apples here, some horses there, and a bunch of nothing (read: trees) in between.

Hoping my fears are entirely unfounded though!"
