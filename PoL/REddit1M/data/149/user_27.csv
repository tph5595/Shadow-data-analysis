4968,"That the main quest doesn't make you want to complete it. That side-quests will be more fun, more engaging, and actually be the bigger reason for logging in long hours than the main quest. The big fear that all these side-quests and mini-quests will be nothing but trivial and repetitive leaning no desire to get 100% on the game.

Basically, that's it becomes Skyrim with a Zelda skin.

I really don't think this fear that the world will just be open and bland with no villages, NPCs or things to do in it is justified. They have almost a year to fill this world in. Let's give them a chance to do so before just saying ""bland and boring is this world""."
5224,Hard to improve on that. WWHD gyro was pretty damn awesome. Only thing they could really do is have an option to adjust the sensitivity.
5393,"I got bored of Skyrim after seeing a friend try to show me the ""awesome things"" about it. He spent 20 minutes in a menu doing almost nothing. I said, ""fuck that"". No game where you spend more time in a menu than playing is worth it.

Then cue him doing a 20 minute dungeon for the same amount of gold that the loot from a single enemy could give him. Oh, and a potion. Don't forget that 1 potion."
5501,"This game *is* coming from Aonuma. This is pretty much the guy who brought us a living, breathing, almost sentient-feeling world of Majora's Mask. I'm pretty sure he isn't going to completely screw up in the living breathing world portion of the game."
5728,"My personal favorite boss from SS was Tentalus. Not so much for gameplay or difficulty, but it was an epic fight started with the epic escape that the boss made necessary. I hope more of that creativity comes into introducing bosses. ""Oh, boss door, let's go in, and..."" small custscene, boss shows himself off, start boss fight.

Am I right?"
5824,"Seriously, maybe the new puzzles are figuring out HOW to get to where you want to go. A page from the book written by Metroid. Sure, sometimes you know where to go or have a map, but getting from point A to point B may not be as simple as walking the straightest line."
11008,He's working on Majora's Mask 3D which is more than probably going to influence his decisions and ideas on Zelda U. Especially if Miyamoto has something to say about it.
11907,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure Aonuma has learned his lesson about large worlds. He's made quite a few, the best in my opinion being The Windwaker. (Wow, have I plugged so many hours into that game with a single file.)

Besides, Skyward Sword's world didn't seem big to me. The loftwing got you from one side to the other in five minutes. As far as exploration goes, I didn't do much because of the lack of incentive to do so. Zelda U, I hope, will increase that incentive if Aonuma does as promised."
