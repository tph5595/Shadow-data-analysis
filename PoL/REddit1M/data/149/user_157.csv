People have pointed out that the open-ended nature may mean that dungeons have no set order, and that no overworld area is blocked off, and that changes how the puzzles and enemies are created and implemented. To me, what was amazing about the lack of total freedom was seeing a passageway blocked by unusual features, or a wide open chasm and wondering what would let you get past it. The curiosity of what was behind it, the satisfaction of finally being able to come back with the right equipment to crack it and see what zone or area beyond was something I found wonderful. 

A lot of people liked Skyrim. Apparently I was one of the few gamers who was largely indifferent. I think one of the issues I had was that I felt no point in doing main quests or side quests, because there were very few areas I simply couldn't just walk to. I'm someone who loves to see new places and wildly different zones, but I could see as much of the world as I wanted to in skyrim so long as I didn't mind walking. The fact that I can't go someplace gives me drive to find the stuff that will. Additionally, if a town needed my help because of bandits or dragons or trolls or whatever, there was little stopping me from just leaving and finding another town that wasn't as troublesome.

I'm certain that that there will be smaller caves and towns that aren't accessible without equipment, and there will be towns that I can't ignore. But I want to see an innocent boy becoming the hero. I want to see that sheltered kid seeing the world outside of where he grew up for the very first time, and imagine what he's thinking. Being told I'm the dragonborn right off the bat is cool and all, and it's enough to keep me going for a bit. But I found a lot more drive to see the story when I was told that Link's friend or sister was taken by horrific creatures, and then seeing Link grow into the role of the hero. 

Skyrim is a wonderful game, but it's not the type of game that compels me to play in the same way it compels most people. Skyrim gives you the freedom and choice to be whatever you want to be in the world they created. It lets you feel like you've been dropped into a fantastic world, and that your choices do have some benefits and consequences. You can be a hero or a monster. But I play video games because someone wanted to tell me a story. Someone wanted me to feel a little of the protagonist's struggles and pain. Someone wanted me to earn the next part of the story through interaction, not by turning a page or patiently watching. 

The Zelda series is one of the couple where I don't feel like the protagonist, I just feel like I'm directing the protagonist through his or her struggles. If I don't point the way, the hero can't save the world. But the hero is the one who encounters danger, who decides to leave all they know to save a friend, the one who stands in the face of unspeakable power and destruction because they're protecting something important. 

I just want to be along for the ride."
