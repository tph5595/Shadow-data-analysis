90331,Really? I found the Skyward Sword overworld far more 'empty' than the Twilight Princess one. TP had tons of caves/pieces of heart/cliff passes/golden bugs and other small things to do that rewarded exploring to some degree. The stuff you could access also scaled with the items you were getting as you got farther into the game.
