9649,"Who said anything about going mainstream or even relating to other video games? The way link looks has nothing to do with being mainstream... Personally, Its the art style that drives a Zelda game and thats what makes them great visually. Link being one of the most iconic characters of nintendo being changed in any degree that doesnt involve improvment through graphics but him as a character is what I think the problem is."
