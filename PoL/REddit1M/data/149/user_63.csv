11539,"I have two big fears for it but they're kind of the same:  Hype and Scale.  

Nintendo has come out and said that this is the biggest team and the biggest game they've ever made.  This game is going to have a LOT going on.  Is that necessarily a good thing though?  Talking to my friends I've made the comment ""man it'd be cool if they just made a mashup of TLoZ and Skyrim"" but I can't help to think...would it really?

I LOVED LBTW!  It kept true to the classic zelda recipe for the most part without adding in a ton of extra stuff.  Do we want tens (or hundreds) of sidequests?  Do we want item crafting?  Character classes? Fetch quests? 

There's always been the joke about adventure games where the plot is that the world is going to end and only the hero can save it...and the hero is busy catching butterflys or something because he's got a sidequest to do that.  I worry that there will be too much of this and it'll take away from the heroic atmosphere that Link usually carries.  

Link is silent, focused on the plot, and has no other interests other than being the hero.  We love him because he's 2-dimensional enough that we can impress own personalities onto him. If there's a bunch of other stuff going on, is that going to be too much of a distraction? Is Link going to develop too much personality?  Will we be playing as Link or will we be playing *as* Link?

But if Nintendo comes out with a brand new LoZ game and it's a pretty ""simple"" but legit Zelda game, will the fan base accept that?  Or would fans say ""this is the best you could do?"" kind of like when there was a huge desire for a dark LoZ but folks weren't satisfied with TP.

I've got a lot of hope.  This could be huge not only for the franchise but to help legitimize the Wii-U.  Nintendo is going to be pulling out all the stops for this one... but is that really the best thing for a LoZ game?"
