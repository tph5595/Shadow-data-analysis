1148,"&gt; For me it is that the open world, won't be that open. It will just be really big, with long linear paths from place to place without much exploration opportunity and a feeling of emptiness.

After seeing the demo and everything that Aonuma has said about the game (like the comparisons to Skyrim), I think you have little to fear here.

&gt; As well as it won't be challenging enough and the bosses won't be that creative or hard, like in Skyward Sword.

Dat Koloktos, though..."
