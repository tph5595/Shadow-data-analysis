That game did an incredible job making a beautiful world that was pretty ripe with stuff to do. I guess a lot of what you do in those open worlds is grind on enemies for a little bit so it feels like you're not wasting time running around, and since Zelda isn't quite the level-based RPG that Xenoblade is, it can be harder to pull off."

27997,I really didn't like how the pointer worked in that game. It wasn't using the sensor bar as much as it was using the Motion Plus controls and it *really* bothered me because it was the only game I had ever seen do that. It just felt so gross and not like the one-to-one pointer motion that we had gotten used to.
28610,"They played huge roles in the story and were the entire reason Link was able to begin his actual quest in the first place. I didn't really like Fi's character all that much until near the end of Skyward Sword. I didn't really dislike her, but she just wasn't special until the end. Midna, however, is my favorite Zelda companion, and I don't recall ever finding her annoying. She was arguably the most helpful companion character with the deepest backstory that ties into the main story.

This thread is honestly the first time I can recall ever seeing people disliking Midna for being an ""annoying companion."""
28823,"I kinda agree that the world felt a little smaller simply because of the ease of access. However that system was what made a lot of more casual gamers love the game. It was new, and it was successful. I think that's what most people are looking for nowadays."

The game wasn't really forcing you to do anything and it didn't exactly feel linear. I mean, it was, since it's Pokemon, but  it made the player feel like they were in control, not the game."
