2194,"In Wind Waker, it was just a *tiny, tiny, optional* tilt which you could use to fine-tune your aiming and it *really* helped.

I agree about having to use motion controls - I'm not a fan - but Wind Waker HD's were *nothing* but a bonus, and they worked really well.  Here's to hoping Zelda U's will as well."
2511,"&gt;For me it is that the open world, won't be that open

I'm not sure if you've realized this yet, but have you seen the new gameplay video?  The gameplay is *definitely* open world, without a doubt.  They made a serious point to say you can go *anywhere* on in the world, and even showed us the map, which is, as they say, completely accessible.  The sailcloth itself pretty much eliminates the fear of linearity - it can obviously take you *extreme* distances as long as you have some height.  They even made the point to say that there are *no barriers*.

Seeing the map, I promise you, it's open world a la Elder Scrolls - probably more-so, as they've already shown off various ways of more unique, *more* free movement/traversing.  Can you sail from mountain to mountain in Skyrim?  Think about that for one second - you can *sail from mountain to mountain.*  That's as open world as it gets, man.  I hope this helped put your fears to rest, because this is the *one* thing you have nothing to fear about."
2833,"They commented on this in the original video, saying that one of the first and primary intentions is things to fill their open world, and give it a point."
3246,"As they show us more and more, I have less and less 'fear' about anything.  The art style is incredible(I can't imagine how it could be any prettier), the open-worldiness looks fantastic, and every little tid-bit of info we're getting seems positive as well.  The magic meter is back, and I *was* worried about stamina-tied arrows/items until the gameplay showed an actual arrow counter, so that's great.

I suppose the only worry I have left is the mood/music/atmosphere.  I just don't want it to lose it's Zelda *feel* for the sake of this more modern game design. (not that I am opposed to this design at all - it's the most excited I've been in a long time - I just want it done the 'Nintendo way'.)

I'm also hoping it won't be so easy.  Something like a difficulty selection, or Hero mode at the beginning would be awesome.  I've just been playing Zelda for far too long to be challenged by the 'basics', and I love challenge."
3516,"In WWHD, I'm pretty sure you could use the Pro controller while still using the gamepad for the map/items, just having it sit on its stand.  That's what this needs."
3609,"Well they commented on that too, saying that one of their primary intentions was making things to fill the world with."
6789,"&gt;the new puzzles are figuring out HOW to get to where you want to go

They actually used almost that exact phrasing.  In their first video, they commented on how you were going to have to *figure out* how you're going to get where you want to go.  This is how it should be - how it was in almost every 2D Zelda, which are the inspiration for this game's world.  Let's hope that's how it plays out."
6932,"You should.  While Wind Waker isn't my *favorite* (it's close though), I'd say WWHD is probably the ""best"" Zelda game there is to play right now, with its updated visuals and polished gameplay mechanics."
13330,"Possibly by making the use of the items in a more organic way, like in some of the 2D games.

Imagine it like the real world - there are no *true* boundaries, you know?  It's all there, if you have the tools to get it it.  There's no black space of nothingness between here and there, like in prior Zelda games.  No separate segments to load, only accessible by a single 'door'.  It's all part of one thing now.

I imagine the items might be scattered throughout the world, accessible in a non-linear way.  Certain tools grant certain traversal abilities, like the ability to climb rocks or glide for example. Maybe there's a steep cavern, which you can jump down, but need a rope to survive the fall. If you can find a way to it, you can get there, legitimately, without any 'fake' space stopping you.

But I don't think the world will be completely accessible from the start, no, that wouldn't be very good design for Zelda.  I think the major difference here is that it's all one, solid, cohesive piece of free land to explore, with non-linear items giving you more exploratory abilities, as they would in reality."
16996,"You know you could turn them off, or even leave them on and use the right stick to aim.. right?"
17356,"They're usually optional, and never required.  The Wii U typically tries to make most of Nintendo's recent controllers work with it."
17524,It's already confirmed to use the Wii U gamepad.  Motion controls might be optional but they're definitely not primary.
17774,"Consider that the resolution of what you actually see in the video is probably a *lower* resolution than the textures themselves, and you probably shouldn't worry *that* much.  Even the most HD texture will look bad on a recording of a TV screen.  They look great in the direct-feed pictures."
17901,You can see literally the entire map if you're high enough and it's clear...
20893,"I have a million times, and I did again, and I don't see what you're talking about.  Literally everything in the line of sight is rendered.

Maybe you're talking about the LoD models?"
23304,"To be fair, Skyrim for me is very open, but that's only because I use mods to restore the athletics/acrobatics abilities from Oblivion which let you move around faster and jump higher.

Zelda will be vastly superior to Skyrim in these kinds of aspects."
