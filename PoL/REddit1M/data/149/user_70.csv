12645,"NGL, I could possibly care less about the bosses not being hard enough (but I'd have to try to care less than I do). Boss battles aren't my thing. I'll do 'em, of course, but they're not the part of the game I enjoy the most. I actually really liked the boss battles in Skyward Sword. To each their own, etc etc.

For me, I worry about the *puzzles* not being hard/interesting enough."
