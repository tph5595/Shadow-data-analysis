Wat."

*Twilight Princess* gets unreal praise from pretty much everybody. The people who dislike it are basically [this guy.](http://www.quickmeme.com/Butthurt-Dweller/)"
71973,"When push comes to shove, *Twilight Princess* was dumbed-down and altogether too easy when compared to its predecessors like *Ocarina of Time* and *Link to the Past*. It tries too hard to be like *Final Fantasy* or other fantasy JRPGs. *Skyward Sword* even more so. Generally speaking, fans were disserviced by both games, but the ""crowd"", i.e. the non-fanboy masses absolutely adore both games.

When Hawkleer says ""not a crowd favorite"" he is being vague. If by crowd he means the reddit Zelda fanboy crowd, then yes, he is to some degree correct. "
97442,Most of these are apathetic rather than antagonistic. People forget that even a mediocre Zelda game is better than most other games in existence.
