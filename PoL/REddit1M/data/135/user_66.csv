44457,"I was excited about Twilight Princess when it came out because it was the first epic Zelda game since Ocarina of Time.  

... Then Skyward Sword came along and blew it out of the water.  For me, it wasn't about the improved motion controls, or dungeon design.  It was about the story - the characters.  

In Twilight Princess, Zelda, who was effectively the ruler of Hyrule, surrendered her kingdom before the start of the game, and spent the entire game doing... well... nothing really.  She shows up at the beginning, says a few words to encourage *you* to go save Hyrule, and then disappears until the end of the game when she gets possessed.  Gee.  Thanks, Zelda.  You're a real help.  

Further, it's just too... formal or something when she talks to you.  I felt absolutely no connection to her, and no obligation to help her.  I just saved her kingdom because I wanted to feel like a badass.  That was it, really.  

In Skyward Sword, it was so much more than that.  Zelda actually cared about Link.  They had these realistic *moments* together.  Just look at how her face [lights up](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKpP_ZQUA8Y&amp;t=22s) when she sees Link at the Temple of Time.   When she was struck down by the tornado, I **wanted** to go down and rescue her.  I didn't do it so I could swing a sword around; I did it because I wanted her to be alright.  Then, you get down there and she's two steps ahead of you for the first half of the game.  In fact, after the second temple, Impa bitches *Link* out for not doing enough.  Even Groose got in to help later on.  

Ultimately, in Skyward Sword I felt that the characters were more realistic.  They acted like people would really react in a crisis -- by doing everything they could to help out.  They didn't just wait for some savior.  Plus, they formed genuine emotional connections with Link and with each other.  

Twilight Princess was epic when it came out... but in a way, Skyward Sword set a new standard, just like Ocarina of Time did back in 1998, and now Twilight Princess just doesn't hold up.  "
