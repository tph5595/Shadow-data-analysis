13346,"I've always found that Twilight Princess pulled out all the stops to be as epic as possible.  After Ocarina of Time came Majora's Mask.  No real core gameplay changes, graphics were almost identical.  Then came Wind Waker - they deliberately didn't go for ""advanced graphics,"" instead going for a more artsy and quirky feeling.  Finally, 8 years after Ocarina of Time, came the first Zelda with almost current-gen graphics, with a trailer of Link riding over the crest of a hill, sword raised.

Anyway, it's pretty obvious they tried to add as many ""epic"" parts as possible.  Epona rearing up in the sunset, the mass army of Bokoblins right before the boss in the Goron Mines, being able to flourish your sword by putting it away right after dealing a finishing blow, etc., etc."
