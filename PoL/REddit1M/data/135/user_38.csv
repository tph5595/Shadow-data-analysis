18959,"Why do you claim Twilight Princess is not a crowd favorite? It was the first Zelda game I played back in 8th grade or so, and it was one of the most captivating games I ever played. I went through Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask a few years later, but they (understandably of course) didn't carry the same sense of grandeur and magic that Twilight Princess did. Wind Waker was a lovely game too just like OoT and MM and TP, but the grandeur of Wind Waker was cheapened by the repetitive expansiveness of the oceans. I enjoyed Twilight Princess most, even after correcting for the fact that it set the standards I had for other games. I think the picture in this submission characterizes most of the reason why I think it should be a crowd favorite; beautiful scenery with some relatively detailed textures for its time, a sense of a beautiful world to explore coupled with a much higher level of maturity than other Zelda games. I am not aware of how the Zelda games are generally ranked in the fanbase, but I would argue that Twilight Princess should be one of the highest ranked games on the list; my only qualms with the game would be that the sidequests are somewhat sparse and that Hyrule Field does not have much content other than some trees, hills, bridges, and enemies (OoT at least had the ranch in the middle to explore while TP's locales are largely located toward the outside of the field areas, with little in the middle)."
