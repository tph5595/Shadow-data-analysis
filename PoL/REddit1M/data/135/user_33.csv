17831,"&gt; it was my first zelda.

Get off my lawn, you youngin', you!"
17843,What was your first Zelda game?
17985,"Ahhh, that's because he's late 90s.

Us from the early 90s remember OoT mostly, though possibly earlier stuff too. (Watched my older cousins play A Link to the Past a bunch and like the original, but from a different perspective than people who played it when it first came out)"
71741,I would definitely vote Jarlaxle for President!
71818,"Ah fair enough, you're probably only like a year younger than me haha.

I just felt like pretending to be an old man"
409371,"(assuming US President here)

Then again... think of all the benefits to Bregan D'aerthe if they controlled the US government...

EDIT: Plus if he figured a country would be useful to him he'd do an amazing job at smooth-talking and dealing with other countries to benefit his own!

(Just reading Road of the Patriarch right now. Caught up with Drizzt a little while ago and figured I should go back and finish up the Sellswords)"
440685,"Haha fair enough.

I definitely love the Entreri/Jarlaxle combo, works so well!

And oh yeah I'm caught up in the Legend of Drizzt series, so I saw the '4e' Entreri in the books! Can't wait to find out the details about what happens though.

Is the thing with the Shade in the Cleric Quintet or something? As they mentioned it briefly in one book but the full ramifications haven't really been discussed yet."
534291,"Ahhh that would explain it, I unfortunately don't own any of the short-story anthology thingies. I'll have to see if I can get one sometime..."
538669,"Ooo, yeah my Physics teacher told me about that series back in high school, I'll definitely have to check them out. Have to be a little while though, I'm going to take a quick break from fantasy to read some cyberpunk"
