12794,"Short-version: Should I finish SS or go find a copy of TP?

Longer-version: I started playing Zelda games on SNES (Link to the Past will always hold a place in my heart). I have played other games over the years (Wind Waker, Ocarina of Time, started Majora's Mask at a friend's house) and have enjoyed the series. I didn't have a GameCube or Wii when Twilight Princess came out, but now my brother has a Wii and Skyward Sword, so I'm borrowing it from them.

I'll admit, I'm not far into SS (have only just reached the surface and am looking for the Kikwi(?) cheif) but... Do these games HAVE to get more and more ""family friendly"" and cartoony with each title? Twilight Princess looked darker and more interesting to me. I'm sitting here trying to play SS (telling myself ""Just get through all the 'cute and goofy' story stuff and then you'll get into some dungeons/temples/whatever..."" but I can't play for more than an hour before I lose interest. Maybe it's the Wii controls I have an issue with.

Anyway, as stated earlier, would I be better off playing SS through or looking for a copy of TP to play?"
