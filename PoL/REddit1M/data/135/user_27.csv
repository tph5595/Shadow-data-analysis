15115,"I fricken love Twilight Princess. It took some good strides as far as innovative ideas, but some of them were kinda poorly integrated. Some of the tools that you get are used for a dungeon and a few secrets, then never again.  
The world itself is one of my favorites. The regions were familiar, but still original.  
The combat was greatly improved too. They worked on it a bit in Wind Waker, but I felt that this one was much better.  
Overall, it is one of my favorites. While OoT still remains a landmark in my mind, Twilight Princess definitely raised the bar."
