43368,"I've been playing Zelda since the original first two on the NES when I was four years old in the 80's, and OoT is still my favorite. There's no denying that it's a tough argument, since other games in the series undoubtedly have better gameplay, so although I think although the temples hold up really well over time and the game still has solid pacing, I think a lot of its appeal amounts to something intangible. Something about the world design just really draws me in, more so than almost any other game I've played. It's the tiny little touches that really push it over the top for me, like the entrance to the Temple of Time having no music, separating it from the market. The game as a whole just does a great job creating atmosphere.

My opinion of the Zeldas is still probably different than most others though, because Link's Awakening is a very close second, with Zelda II also being way up on my rankings. Man, I love me some Zelda II. "

The first time I was missing one somewhere in the world, and never found it, even after following two separate guides over several times. Not being able to find it haunted me for years.

Seriously, I think the lack of some sort of marker like the skultula icons on the map in OoT is TP's biggest flaw. That's only a SLIGHT exaggeration. "
