10125,"I absolutely hated how everyone loved this game so much upon release and now with SS, a large portion of the fanbase (source: skimming *numerous* fan sites such as ZeldaUniverse, article comment sections, game review comments, *plenty* of youtube comments and  /r/zelda itself) seems to despise TP as opposed to SS. Wtf? I guess this is where the ""not a crowd favorite"" vibe comes from.

I for one, loved TP and still do. I'd say the problem with it is that it's aged tremendously somehow. SS has overshadowed it as a wii game. Everyone thinks it's the superior wii game because of it's superior controls but last time I checked, TP wasn't designed with Wii controls in mind. It's just a port. And plus now I hear fans complaining how it's ""too similar to OoT""? Give me a break. I mean yeah it's similar but fans also seem to hate it when Zelda breaks away from tradition and ""changes too much"". Basically zelda fans interests and playing preferences are all over the place usually, I'd say out of diversity. But still at times it feels hypocritical. 

I know fans rag on TP for being ""fake dark"" or something like that. I just don't remember these criticisms when the game first came out. Everyone loved the visual style and I still do as well. I just really liked the gritty and bloomy lightning it had. So what if it's not as dark as MM, it's still a pretty dark game as opposed to others. This shot as linked here, as well as numerous others, just have this crazy breathtaking cinematic quality to it. The series needed that one game that was extremely dark on the literal level and this was it. To this day I still enjoy far more than SS's weird clusterfuck of visual styles (not cutsey enough to be Wind Waker but not dark enough to be TP. Cute colorful charcters then some realistic ones then a really out of place and ""dark"" final boss, Demise? I don't get it)

**EDIT:** [Here's Proof for context](http://i.imgur.com/wZpr6.png) for those who don't believe me when I say a shockingly high amount of people dislike TP alot. This was found via only a few minutes of keyword searching only one youtube video. "
38727,No it's true. You'd be surprised how many people really loathe TP
39376,You don't deserve this many downvotes bro
39590,"I'd say it's mixed reception at best. As you can clearly see by this thread, there's quite a number of people who aren't big fans. I mentioned in another post how it's because people are always comparing it to OoT or SS. Either SS is a superior successor or it's a ""recycled OoT"""
42019,"Can you help explain this to me a bit more? Haha the mention of being an art student reminds me of my art student friends who'd probably say the same thing haha. 

But yeah having dabbled in art for a time, I'm not unfamiliar with Impressionism or it's elements but I guess I still don't see how it applies to SS maybe because I don't understand it well enough. 

And I guess I'm also talking about not just the visual style but the games overall tone and style in itself. Again, maybe due to lack of understanding but I don't see how such artistic style contributes to the game's overall feel. TP's literal dark theme and emphasis on bloom effects matched it's gritter and epic feel. The characters also took on a more ""realistic"" and more emotional design. Wind Waker had a much lighter tone, it's bright pastel colors matching the brilliance and grandeur of sailing the vast expanse of the ocean. The characters matched this by generally being more playful and lighthearted. Humor was also much more evident. MM matched it's macabre, chinese masked theme with clock town's design and it's strange dark palette of colors. And so on and so forth. "
44581,"Ah okay. So historical context does indeed come into play at parts. I would know if it weren't for the fact that the art history class I'm in only covered up to the medieval times haha.

Am I wrong for interpreting most Impressionist art I see as blurry and dreamy? That's typically the vibe I got. Just weightless and colorful (I do really love the Impressionist art I've been exposed to though. I'd say it's one of the art styles I favor as opposed to like, say surrealism haha). 

I do see a problem in this though. The part with the Skyloftians seem to question the existence of the surface. Personally I thought the game was pretty clumsy with the whole interaction between the surface and the sky. It seemed like Groose was the only character who got it right, because to me, it seemed like the Skyloftians denied it because *the game does little to let them even interact with the surface*. Groose is the only character to directly interact with it, let alone even mention it. I don't know about you, but to me, Link didn't seem very much a stranger to the surface to me. He kind of plunged right in and felt right at home. And especially as a gamer, I don't get this feeling of unfamiliarity most obviously because we've seen archetypes of these worlds before, forest desert and mountain. Basically my point is that the whole separation of worlds in the game didn't seem that strong. They seemed to be separate only for literal reasons, not because of a clash of cultures or a foreign feel. The worlds just never interacted with each other and thus never clashed. While this is entirely a seperate issue in the game, I do feel like it undermines the whole concept of ""strangeness"" to me."
46479,"We need more responses like this. Basically I was trying to get at the idea at how there just seems to be an unfair animosity towards TP. Everyone acts like they never liked TP or something. It gave off this bad taste of ""zelda syndrome"" where fans only eat up which game is ""new"" and ""fresh"". Even today I have a bad feeling that give another 6 or 7 years when another zelda console game comes out, SS can potentially age the same way. Not because any game is ""bad"" but as you've said, the standards keep changing among the fans. 

Twilight Princess definitely isn't one of my personal favorite zelda games, but I still really loved it. While even though I enjoyed it a touch more than SS, I'll still give the story nod to SS. Still there are some issues I had with it, both games even.

Comparing the Zeldas in both games doesn't work for me. They both had entirely separate roles to fill. TP Zelda was intended to be much more formal. She was just a royal figure who failed her kingdom. It's intended that she does nothing. It's important that she retreats to a room in a tower while her kingdom gets plagued by darkness. While yes I agree she wasn't well developed,but the game at least doesn't try to portray her with the same significance of SS Zelda. Midna instead fills that role in TP. And I think we all know how great a character Midna was.

I noticed though that people didn't seem to acknowledge the insignificant Zelda to such a degree until SS Zelda came along. Just like with the motion controls, people compared SS and TP side-by-side too much. I think that was the main problem. They were both pretty different games with different roles.

And I'm guess I'm weird but I strangely found alot of the characters in SS to be pretty flat. No, Ghirahim, Zelda, and Groose were all perfect. They were just fantastic, some of the best primary characters in the franchise. It was the supporting cast that didn't do much justice to me. I personally really felt the connection with saving the children in TP. Telma and her crew, although brief in appearance, really stayed in my memory. No I'm not saying TP has the superior character cast but rather I just don't think SS is as great as some people say. The people of Skyloft were extremely forgettable along with the rather dry races through the game. I've played the game twice and I still don't remember any of the Mogmas. 

I'm also weird for having some qualms with the story. The Hylia backstory is hardly developed and the results really show. We don't get much insight and incentive into fighting Demise. He's just some bad guy who uh...did that thing..uh that one really bad thing I think. Basically the game does a poor job of giving us a reason to wanna beat Demise besides ""save the world"". His negative impact on the world is hardly alluded to. The game doesn't go through with the whole backstory of the ""united races"" thing it mentions in the intro. It just tried so hard to focus on the zelda story that the support was rather weak. Also after a certain extent, I guess I just didn't feel the connection and the whole ""I love zelda so I wanna save her"" deal. I guess it was because I felt so used by her. She even tearfully admits it too (in a fantastic cutscene btw). That's another thing too. The story felt rushed at certain points in terms of backdrop development. You keep chasing after her in the first few parts of the game. Then when you find her, she drops the bombshell of the whole Hylia thing (poorly developed I might add) and breaks it to you that she used you to clean up the mess she made. It felt too ""damsel in distressey"" than saving a close friend of mine because I genuinely loved her. I guess that was my problem was that it was just chores and chores, then heres a bombshell of story we'll throw at you all at once, then go finish an entire song then we'll continue the story in rushed fashion. "
47451,"No I perfectly understand your point. It's weird though, I actually found the opposite to be true of the avatar statement. I always thought Link was a blank slate for players...up until Wind Waker where they started to finally give him emotions and a personallity. I personally thought SS's Link had by far the most personality. There was much more of a disconnect for me, not in a bad way, but instead of feeling like I was in the game like in older zelda games (majoras mask and earlier), I was controlling a character. 

But yeah see I wish more characters were like Groose and the barrier between sky and surface actually made an impact. I've always been an advocate of dynamic characters, ones that acknowledge the world that they are in. Majoras Mask perfected this, where almost every person had something to say about the moon, and as it got closer, their responses changed. In SS, most characters don't seem to notice it. I'd like to wish the characters were like, in say Kingdom Hearts (if you dont mind the comparison), where the intro stage of the game, Destiny Islands where all the characters seemed to have a strong yearning or at least acknowledgement of the unknown. They all expressed some sort of feeling about the leaving their secluded island they grew up on. They wondered ""is there a world out there?"" ""is it worth exploring?"" ""this is unfamiliar teriotory because we were born and raised here!"". 

Heres another comparsion. Skyloft to the surface was like Hyrule Castle Market is to Hyrule Field. They seemed to only feel separate because of literal geographical reasons and nothing more. There's not like a culture clash or unfamiliarity. Skyloft literally felt like just another town and not one that was in the sky. It wouldn't have felt much different if Skyloft was on the surface as well. It being in the sky contributed little to nothing to game as much as it could've. Does this make sense?

And yeah, if my interpretation of Impression is correct, then I guess i just didn't feel how it contributed to it's style. The game didn't match the dreamy lightweightedness. I can see how they attempted to achieve this through the whole flying concept but I realized how weak the flying culture in the game was. Link spends most of the time dicking around on the surface. And the surface didn't complement it much either. The mountain was just a mountain, the desert looked like any other sandbox, the forest, just a bunch of open space with trees around it. Maybe I'm expecting too much. Idk.

That's basically just my interpretation of things. I dont expect anyone to agree but at least understand where I'm coming from haha"
53892,"Agreed with the first part.

Fake Dark means like, how people think the dark tone of the game is too forced and isn't genuine. The common thing to say is like ""lol the game has black and darker colors everywhere ooooooh *dark*"". It's agreeable to an extent but still doesn't take too much away from the game imo."
56133,"Right yeah I agree, that's why it's such a silly criticism. It's shocking how many people feel this way and hate on it's style. I bet I can skim this thread and find a comment or two on it (possibly. haven't tried yet).

People compare it a little too much to MM. Yes I worship MM and even though I think it's a ""darker"" game, it achieves this with a different more subtle approach than just grim lighting. Basically imo, it's not worth comparing to MM. Their overall approaches to a dark atmosphere are very different. Doesn't mean one pales in comparison to the other."
57438,"This. This so much. 

Yes I think fans get too purist about certain games sometimes. Not that I'm saying that I dislike OoT, no, I absolutely love that game and I do think it deserves some of it's ""best game of all time"" accolades. However your observation on the Oot fans really does make a good case for considering OoT....dare i say...

Overrated.

At least in the sense that people put it wayyy too high on a pedestal sometimes. The end result is what you just said. "
66571,"You don't deserves this many downvotes as in, this opinion should not be this unpopular. You're totally right. SS was just so padded and repetitive and recycled...among *numerous* other flaws. "
71522,"I don't trust game review sites because they all give anything with Zelda slapped onto it an A+ or something. (That's an exaggeration, of course but you get my point).

I was concerning the fans. It's tough to find exact evidence here and there but as I've mentioned, many many places. Youtube video comments for one. Also there were many ZU articles at a time discussing the concept of ""IS SKYWARD SWORD AN IMPROVED TWILIGHT PRINCESS??"" and the comments would rag on TP and they would get double digits in Thumbs up votes. 

Actually on that note, I kind of wanna find some exact evidence. I shall be right back eventually."
