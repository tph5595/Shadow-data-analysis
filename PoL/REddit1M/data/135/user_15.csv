11831,Skyward Sword has actually made me appreciate Twilight Princess more than I used to...
12192,"TP's problem was that it was too big with too little to do.  It had a bunch of fun items that didn't really get used in clever enough ways.  It had this cool version of the kingdom of Hyrule, with no real connection to the place or is people.  There were not nearly enough sidequests and, like most Zelda games, *there's nothing to buy*.   It had great scenes like this, but the plot was just kinda *meh*.  The most fun I had in the entire game was that circus game where you were able to doubleclawshot to *any* surface as you collected the orbs.

I don't know.  I played it, I had fun, I just never connected with the game's universe, characters, or plot; and the item use was too restrictive for me. I feel that a Zelda game should compel you to explore its world, like ALttP, MM, or WW did for me. "

I still don't think that TP was all that great, but it was a hell of a lot better than SS."
79094,"of all the wasted potential items, I think the Domination Rod takes the cake.  It was used in one really cool sequence where you had to take that golem around as it fights with you; then its used as  glorified block pushing mechanic for the rest of the game.

And the world was compelling to explore, I just never found anything..."
84310,I think you hit the nail on the head.  TP just didn't re ally have a character or identity of its own.
88818,"Yeah, the Ganondorf ""reveal"" is a big part of what makes my overall ""*meh*"" reaction to Twilight Princess."
