Haters gonna hate. "
50757,"I love and respect Ocarina for what it is, but I was always way more heavily invested in the story and characters in Twilight Princess than OoT. Also, the boss fights in Twilight Princess (Temple of Time notwithstanding) made you feel like a hero. 

I'm about halfway through Skyward Sword right now...so I'll withhold judgement on that one. =)"
52266,"Interesting! I didn't like him because I believe I had already run into one before the Temple of Time, so it didn't feel exciting to fight it. Also, I had run into plenty of them in Wind Waker, so he didn't feel threatening. Favorite mid-boss by far for me was Death Sword.

And as far as bosses go, undoubtedly my favorite was Argorok from the City in the Sky. Although Morpheel and and Stallord give it a run for its money. "
