33377,"I agree to a point; I think TP was in some ways characterized by wasted potential, especially with some gameplay elements (Wolf Link, items like the Spinner).

That said, I think the game as a whole is underrated.  I still find Midna to be the most interesting character in any Zelda game, ever, and the whole world has always been very atmospheric and explorable to me.  "
