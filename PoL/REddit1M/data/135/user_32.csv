17134,"the time stuff can definitely be an annoyance.  here's my advice, go find a good guide (I used zeldadungeon.net), and work your way through the quests.  some here might feel using a guide isn't the best way to go about it, but if you really want to see what this game about, it's in the side quests.  And it's not just about collecting masks; there's beautiful and sad stories in there.  

really blows my mind how this game was made so quickly after OoT.  "
