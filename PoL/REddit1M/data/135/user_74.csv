49859,"This game is fucking awesome. Unpopular opinion here, but I think this game took the OoT style of playing and PERFECTED it. I know everyone loves OoT, but it's nowhere close to my favorite. This game here is number 3. So awesome."
49978,"I'm with you. Wind waker is my favorite for a reason. such a beautiful and expansive ocean to explore. If you ask me, hyrule field doesn't hold a candle to the great sea. "
50075,Well of course. He's white
50099,Don't forget to add the size of the Great sea. 
50168,That's the reason I like it. Pretty much perfected OoT's style of play. 
50201,Don't forget wind waker. That game demolishes.
50497,"I agree completely. I honestly though it was the minority opinion. Everywhere I go people just say ""Nope. best game ever made, end of story"" 

I mean yeah, it's great, but there are so many games that demolish it. I love it for jumpstarting the whole 3d zelda game series, like the way the rolling stones set rock music  in motion. I just don't the rolling stones are THAT great on their own. A lot of the complaints epople have about modern zelda's is present in OoT. Like TP's slow start, Skyward swords lengthy exposition cutscenes in the beginning of the game, and Skyward swords (I know this suicide) closed off feeling. I'm sorry, but hyrule was just so lackluster to me. The cities and other sections of the game were great, and ESPECIALLY the dungeons. But the field just had nothing for me. I hated traversing it."
50744,"&gt;And plus now I hear fans complaining how it's ""too similar to OoT""

This always makes me laugh my ass off. It just shows that fans will always complain about something. First, they want to know why nintendo isn't making another game like OoT because it's the fan favorite, then they complain that it's so similar to OoT. If you ask me, TP took the OoT style and perfected it, and is miles better.

wat"
50906,"Twilight princess is what happens when Ocarina levels up, and gets better gear. It's OoT, without the awkward n64 era graphics and thumb destroying control stick. Personally, I prefer wind waker to OoT, but TP is up there too."
51016,It had its problems but did it really merit hate? That's a little extreme.
51815,"I'll never understand why people ragged on WW's art style. Even if I didn't like the art style, it's the only flaw I see in the game. I do have a few problems but they are minor personal gripes, and not actual flaws. Namely, I wish the ghost ship had been a dungeon, and that the temples had harder puzzles."
52360,"Yup :) Like every game I like, its strengths outweighs its flaws. No game is perfect, not even OoT. Dear lord that game is nowhere close to perfect. Don't hurt me zelda fanbase."
55719,"Well it has the elements of the aforementioned ""fake dark"" to the extent of having grim visuals and dark lighting, but I don't see it as fake. I think the game cultivated a wonderful cast of characters and plotline while having an organic darkness to it. Just because it has spooky lighting doesn't mean it isn't truly dark."
56124,"I can't agree on your first point. Just innovating and bringing new things forward doesn't make a game the best. I appreciate all it did, but a game doesn't have to be different for me to enjoy it, or for it to be considered good. 

Also, wind waker is awesome. My favorite for a reason. The sea is actually fun for me to traverse because it's just a bunch of empty, and it's not a central hub. the world doesn't fan out from one point. It's just a huge wonderful world."
56448,"It almost feels like a lot of zelda fans that hang on too strongly to the OoT. By this I mean that instead of criticising/enjoying the games for what they are, they just talk about what they aren't as compared to OoT. They won't let another game be like OoT, because when one gets close, they find every tiny flaw it has and make them such a big deal. of course not everyone is like that, but it seems like a lot of people have this attitude."
58598,"As harsh as it sounds, this is exactly what I mean. It's not that there will never be a better game, it's that some people just straight up won't let there. ""OoT was the best and will always be. End of story"". The next zelda could be the holy grail of all zeldas, and there will still be people who say it doesn't come close to OoT. "
59496,"I still can't agree. Me out of the equation or not, I can't agree that it was the best game. Innovation just isn't the deciding factor in game quality. "
70325,I'm glad someone recognizes this
70379,"The wolf was fun as hell, the tear fetch quests were hardly a bother, and the easiest zelda game was the DS titles by FAR. The only really easy thing about TP was the dungeon bosses."
82904,"Dude, every time I play windwaker, I avoid everything until I have to search for triforce pieces. Then I go get the platform, and secret cave charts, and just explore the whole god damn ocean square by square. I've never beaten it though, just seen the ending and last boss/dungeon and so on. The farthest I've gotten is a few weeks ago. Whole map done, now I'm looking for the heart piece and shit, but my disc died :C I am so sad these days."
84874,Hopefully amazon has the answer
