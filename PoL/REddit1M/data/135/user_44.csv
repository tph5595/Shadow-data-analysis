2. Ocarina of Time

3. Wind Waker

4. Twilight Princess

Something I missed for *years* until very recently was that the Deku mask was created from stealing the soul of the Deku Butler's son, and that's the twisted Deku ""corpse"" you see at the beginning of the game. At the end of the credits you can see the butler kneeling next to the plant, mourning."
