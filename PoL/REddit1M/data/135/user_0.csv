Thats not to say I don't think TP is great, I just like ALL the other ones more, and Twilight Princess never had any replay value to me, Im just recently playing it for the second time since it came out, and only enjoying it because I remember absolutely nothing from it."
3566," Ocarina of time and Majoras mask are great, but since you played the later games first youre gonna have to adjust to a different type of gameplay, theres more of a less is more feel to them, great storylines and gameplay for the time. Majoras mask I like better because of how much side stuff there is to do, and how much darker and creepier it is than any of the other games. Some of the parts in that game scared the piss out of me when I was like 7."

29960,"Okay, fine I get it. People like Twilight Princess. Most people I know arent big fans of it, I didnt know that wasn't the average response."
