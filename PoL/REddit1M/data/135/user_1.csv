270,I love this game.  Literally refusing to beat it and screwing around in side quests to just play the game longer.  
2244,"It's been my most recent.  Introduced through WW, then kinda switched off until I saw SS, beat that, then picked up TP because I wanted another zelda game to beat.  Probably best decision of the year.  "
2667,Not from me you won't.  Going to admit this game successfully has controlled my emotions multiple times.  
3353,"I loved Wind Waker, i could find almost nothing wrong with it.  I gotta play Ocarina of Time sometime, I actually have it able to play, just don't have the time.  Also need to buy MM.  I love TP because of it's realistic feel, and the fact that if you take a minute to look around in the world, there are secrets all over Hyrule Field and such.  Skyward Sword I loved, but it has more of a casual feel than TP did for me.  I felt the sky and safety was too close almost, and that nothing as epic as some things in TP ever happened.  I did play it the two times though, because I thought it was worth it, and I wanted to get more side quests in.  "
3832,"I agree, I've played a tad bit of OoT and have noticed that, but I have set a goal this summer to find all the old Zelda games on the Wii Shop Channel and beat all the ones I can.  Mostly to increase my Zelda knowledge.  Funny thing is I've got a friend who has only played one old Zelda game (Link's Awakening) and refuses to believe that any modern Zelda game is any better.  I've been itching to show him that they aren't better per se, but just different in style.  On an unrelated note, I CAN'T DO SKULLTULAS.  That's a major impediment on my Zelda playing.      "
73275,"Yes Yes I have, I just haven't beat it yet.  My parents didn't love the whole video game idea in my younger years, so I didn't get around to it until recently."
73327,Oh I beat SS twice.  Running away and getting other people to kill them are helpful.  
73383,"That is what I was getting at.  No old game is better than a new one, or vice versa, just your perception and experience.  "
73425,Yep I heartily agree.  It's the first song I added to my ipod after the 25th Orchestra.  
73539,"Opening up Malo Mart in Castle Town, fixing random things around Hyrule Field, golden bugs, stuff like that, not really side quests but stuff to do that's kinda fun.  "
73609,"Beginning really does, until it drops you into Hyrule Castle in twilight in a matter of 10 seconds.  That was the best introduction to a Zelda game I've seen in a while. "
73680,"The ocean was a boss, all those random islands and outposts were awesome to deal with if you weren't on a clear mission.  "
73757,"I will eventually, right now that Cave of Ordeals or whatever in Gerudo Desert has become a focus of mine ever since I stumbled upon it.  "
73844,"You played SS yet?  That's got one good one, and one kind of alright one.  "
74229,"Sorry to hear that, it's a great game, and i'm sure prices will crash once the Wii U comes out, it's definitely worth a play or two.  "
74672,"It's all right in my opinion, it really felt more immersible and realistic.  Sure the occasional swing was off, but I felt like it was a pretty awesome way to bring Zelda forward.   "
76495,"You got me there, but keep in mind that they are classics, which have had time to grow old and more appreciated.  SS has the potential to do just that.  "
77105,"In another 5 or 10 you might, when it turns into an old Zelda game, like we have with WW, TP (kinda), OoT, and many others."
77520,You've made a good point there.  I'm finding it hard to really concentrate on OoT because of all the childhood stories of it on here and the fact that I can't ever have that kind of memory of it as I did WW.  
83892,"Damn...gotta respect that devotion.  You gotta get it cheap somewhere, I bought my copy way back when for 14.99 at Gamestop.  "
85027,They always do in my experience.
