23185,"The only thing I didn't like about the game is the enemies didn't seem that challenging, and, well, ""But your wallet is full, so let's just put the ruppee back in the chest and leave it unmarked on the map""

Other than that, I LOVED it. I loved Midna. I loved Zelda. I loved the showdown with Ganon. At first, when Ganon's name was mentioned during the Temple of Time scene, I thought ""oh for fucks sakes, Can't we get a new enemy to take over, I liked thinking Zant was the new enemy"", but when it came down to the ending, where you have to fight him not once, not twice, not three times, but FOUR TIMES, that made it worth it."
