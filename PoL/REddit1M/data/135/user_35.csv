87875,"It has the most character development of any zelda game ever.  It has the gameplay of OoT (which is the main thing going for OoT; people just call it ""the best"" because it did it first).  It has the most innovative macro game mechanic ever in a zelda game (the three days system).  I could talk about the virtues of that for way longer than is appropriate here.  It's the darkest zelda game (other than maybe awakening, but fuck the 2d zeldas).  And last but not least, it has some [seriously mature themes and symbolism](http://www.zeldauniverse.net/articles/the-message-of-majoras-mask/)."
