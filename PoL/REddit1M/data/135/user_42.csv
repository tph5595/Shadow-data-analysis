21482,"Yes sir, went on the Wii Shop Channel myself and I'll tell you that you'll be doing a lot more than increasing knowledge. I absolutely loved Link to the Past, and the original.

This may sound crazy but the original is very similar to Dark Souls if you've ever played that: 1) it's pretty hard and doesn't hold you're hand; 2) doesn't tell you where the hell to go; and 3) the storytelling is all through lore and minimal dialogue - as a result you feel a really close connection to the overworld and it really encourages you to explore."
21778,"I always felt TP was just OoT with better graphics.  Plus I always found those goblins to be waaaay too cartoony to fit the style they were going for.

I liked TP a lot - but it made me think of OoT the whole time."
22289,"I agree.  The only part I'll fault you on is that TP DID compel me to explore; there was soooo much potential, however, back to your point, it always left me deflated everything always seemed to fall flat. 

Thing is, I can't really pinpoint why.  Yes, it was very easy, I think the tear collecting was egregious, and I didn't really like the enemies at all. But those things don't break it for me.  I think it goes to your point of the game and its universe lacking character."
59787,"I said nothing about the gameplay - only graphics.  The style of play in TP was the weakest aspect of that game.  The wolf was terrible, the tear fetch quests made me cry, and it has the easiest difficulty of any zelda game in the series."
60050,I agree with literally every point of yours. 
72759,"Yea, I'm with you on the fact that OoT has some pretty special character. The reason I think I connect with OoT over TP is how engrossed you feel with respect to the overworld.  In OoT you're an outsider, a loner, and Hyrule field is likewise lonely.  The only things that populate it are skeletons at night, poes, and an extremely occasional flying turnip. The field is yours and yours alone.

TP, while phenomenal in its certain respects, didn't capture that same sense of wonder.  I never felt like Hyrule was mine to explore.  It came close but no cigar.

The other reason I fault TP is that it felt like an emulation of OoT.  Where as other Zelda games feel like they had their own identity, TP SOMETIMES felt like it was trying to recreate the magic of it's predecessor.  I think that most people would agree that even MM, a direct sequel to OoT, still held a separate identity.  It had a different objective than OoT - TP's was just too similar.

Still, I thoroughly enjoyed TP overall and actually enjoyed it far more my second playthrough."
72796,Why do you think that is?

79756,Fi gives you the most obvious information at the worst of times.
