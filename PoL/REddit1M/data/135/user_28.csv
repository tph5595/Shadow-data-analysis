15531,"I'm replaying it now and it's not nearly as terrible as I remember. I am about to enter the last dungeon so I an very close to the end. With that said there are some glaring flaws in the game.  I can't tag this for SPOILERS from my iPhone but you are warned. 

1. Some original items but falls back into using same old ones (bow, hookshot, boomerang). The slingshot  for example is obsolete after one dungeon, and virtually everything else is used in the dungeon it is found in then never again. 

2. A massive world with very little to do. There are basically no side quests besides the malo mart chain. Collecting poes is very easy and you find most of them through the story. Heart pieces shouldn't be in dungeons with a world this massive. 

3. It lived in OoT's shadow. LttP is my favorite Zelda. I was 3 when it was released. OoT was great to me for nostalgia factor. TP tries to hard to emulate OoT and as a result it does not create its own identity. The best moments for me have been ones with direct influence from OoT (entering the Temple of Time for instance). I know they wanted to appeal to the OoT audience, but in doing so it set itself up for failure.  When the best moments for me are dependent on me playing OoT I ask myself, ""why don't I just play OoT?"". That brings me to the next complaint...

4. The art style. I know it's going for OoT style more ""adult"". ""Adult"" however does not mean shades of brown on everything. 

5. Boss design. All the bosses felt repetitive and boring. They went for epic scale but also stayed true to modern Zelda boss formula of making it have a puzzle element. In doing so it causes battles with easily predictable patterns to drag on because these giant beasts need to execute their massive attacks over longer time. 


I know that's a lot of complaints. Even with that it is still a solid game. A bad Zelda (not counting CDi) is still a solid experience. When compared to other Zelda games it just falls a bit short. The biggest issue was it didn't really do anything to revolutionize the franchise. It fell into a comfort zone and tried to recreate OoT. I look at TP and say ""this game leaves no legacy on the Zelda franchise."" That is its biggest issue. "
