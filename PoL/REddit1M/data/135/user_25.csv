You can't forget the hidden skills. I missed those the most when I started playing SS."

TP Link would've been my favorite if he could just JUMP.

It was so frustrating to find a gate about as tall as Link in Twilight Princess and not be able to just jump right over it. He can defeat monsters ten times his size, transform into a wolf, and have the coolest sword-sheathing animation ever, but goshdarnit, the boy can't jump two feet."
