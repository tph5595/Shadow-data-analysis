42436,If OoT Link could figure them out anyone could. Who's to say that OoT Link made them up? Maybe SS Link could have and OoT Link found them when he was living out his new life.

The abilities themselves aren't really useful as the the mainstay of a game, but they were very much appreciated in TP."
