11002,"This is my number 1 favorite Zelda game. I've first played it in the 4th grade when my older brothers friend left it at our house, he said he didn't want it and that i could have it. Since then I have been hooked on Zelda. This game is still my number one Zelda adventure. None of the other games I have played so far has topped this one.

10/10. Incredible"
