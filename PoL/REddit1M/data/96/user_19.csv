21538,"&gt; Who's worried about that? 

I'm worried about that.

And you misunderstand the concern. We're not looking for PS4 graphics. We're looking for an art style that doesn't make me think I'm playing a saturday morning cartoon. TP did this wonderfully, on a GameCube."
24955,"&gt; So anything that isn't realistic is a ""saturday morning cartoon""? Painting has been a thing for as long as man has been a thing, and the most renowned artists are often in the least realistic/most exaggerated styles.

I didn't use the word realistic. That was another user.

&gt; I'll take the full potential of art relative to the hardware over some odd fear of being associated with cartooniness. If anything, I think that anti-cartoon attitude is less mature than the cartooniness in question. It reminds me of kids in elementary school pretending like ""Haha you like CARTOONS? What a baby!"" because they want to seem grown up. It's... adolescent.

OK this is just strawman projections. I like cartoons. I liked Wind Waker as a game. I didn't call anyone a baby. Chill bud.

&gt; And what you're asking for is a semi-realistic/Twilight Princess-esque art style, yes, which would look nothing but dated in comparison to pretty much any other game that does the same thing. Why ask for more dated looking visuals, when you can have something be gorgeous through art? For the sake of realism/maturity? You'd ask something to restrain its artistic potential - to essentially look worse than it can - for the sake realism? That's just backwards.

I don't think TP is even realistic. It's just a great art style that I think fits the theme in a way that WW's style does not (and I liked WW...but never got fully into it because of the art style). You keep equating TP with realism. Have you looked at TP lately? It doesn't look like real life to me.

&gt; Personally, I think TP is probably the most boring looking Zelda game relative to its age. 90% faded, fuzzy greenish browns. When it came out, there were already many games in similar styles that absolutely blew it away. Realism has never been impressive on low-end hardware.

OK, that's your opinion. My opinion is not only that it looks great, but it fits in with the themes in the best way."
25710,"&gt; But you cited Twilight Princess, which is by far the most realistic Zelda game and is always brought up with realism related desires.

Not to me. TP doesn't look realistic to me, so it's irrelevant to my opinion.

&gt; I said it's what it reminded me of. What exactly is so wrong with something looking like a cartoon? The only logic behind that I can find is what I described.

OK, I'm sorry you had bad memories brought up? Not sure what this has to do with me

&gt; But it certainly tries to look more realistic than the rest, and those are Nintendo's own sentiments on the matter. You talked of cartooniness as a non-desire, and cite a game that is regarded as the most realistic, so what else am I to assume other than you want realism?

Again, I don't see realism when I took at TP. I see a darker theme. That's what I like. It's just my opinion.


Edit: Fuck me for having an opinion. Stay classy, /r/zelda
