That said, they *should* keep using the OoT/MM/TP artstyle. I really think a grim fantasy look really makes a world feel on the brink of calamity, and it helps immerse the player with a sense of urgencey in wake of a coming cataclysm."

Last time I checked, the real world is actually very vibrant and bright, and people don't look like they're from an anime."
