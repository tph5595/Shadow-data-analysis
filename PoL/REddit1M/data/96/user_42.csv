42790,BotW's art direction is the perfect balance.
65562,"Wind Waker is pure cartoon (and also looks fantastic). The art direction has a lot more edge than Wind Waker. You can see it in the character models, the enemies, the wild life, and the environment."
66712,Art direction does not strictly boil down to the use of cel-shading lol. Even with cel-shading they're going for more of a sense of realism than Wind Waker. I view this game as essentially a clean balance between TP and WW.
67607,"You're right. The entire job of Breath of the Wild's art director was ""cel-shading or no?"". Art style and overall art direction are separate things, which you seem to be ignoring. The models built for these games aren't completely defined by the shaders used on them. The overall art direction is a mesh of different things we've seen used in Zelda games before."
69203,"I can completely agree that cel-shading is a cartoony art style, but the entire art direction is not simply made up of cel-shading lol. Character, creature, and environmental designs all make up art direction as well. And while BotW borrows cel-shading from Wind Waker, it also borrows the idea of somewhat more realistic designs from games like TP and OoT. All of this makes up the art direction for the game. Which is what I was saying when I stated that it was a perfect balance. For me at least."
