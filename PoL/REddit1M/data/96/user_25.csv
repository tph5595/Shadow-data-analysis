28349,"They tried to go with a darker, grittier theme (because that's what a lot of people wanted and apparently still want).  I love Zelda's whimsical and colorful styles.  I hope they don't go full Dark Souls.  Zelda has never been that and, IMO, would lose a lot of its charm if it did.  

I just replayed TP and there was a handful of times I thought to myself that they were really trying to be creepy and sort of ""dark"" on purpose just because that's what they thought everyone wanted.  Like, you could tell they threw certain moments in or certain details in just to mark the Dark/Gritty box on their checklist.  I didn't hate it, but I just don't think it works for Zelda.  "
28443,"Man, I'm glad we have you around to help all us dummies."
28470,OoT was colorful as heck.  
28519,"I mean, Wind Waker is considered the best Zelda game by a lot of people.  And OoT is far from dark, man.  It's pretty lighthearted and colorful.  Majora's Mask is, too, really."
34208,"I mean if we're talking color schemes alone, maybe you could argue that.  But when people say dark, they're usually referring to the tone of the game, not just the color scheme/actual brightness. "
34490,"Oh, I don't think it's a bad game at all.  I've always enjoyed it.  I think a lot of what you say in the first part of your comment is basically just Zelda games in general, though (except for the family part).  But Wind Waker Link had a family (sister and aunt[grandma, not aunt, dumbass]).  Even the rest of the townsfolk knew him.  ALttP had an uncle.  TP wasn't the first to do Link's family.  And every Zelda game has had those treasure hunt side quests throughout the game (including fishing).  Those weren't new, either, in TP.  

But yeah, I don't think TP was a ""dark"" game really.  I think it was a great Zelda game that Nintendo tried to kind of ""darken"" if that makes sense haha.  A darker color palette, some creepy-ish moment (more so than past games), some more mature themes and story points.  They were trying to basically do the opposite of what many thought Wind Waker had done which was to make a childish Zelda game.  There was a lot of backlash against that from some fans so they tried the other side of the spectrum for TP.  

But I agree, I don't think it makes it a dark game despite many people claiming that it is."
42889,"I mean, TP was only two games ago.  TP then Skyward Sword and now BotW.  Not been that long.  If we're going by 3D games alone, and we count OoT, MM, and TP as the more bleak games, you could argue they outweigh the ""lighter"" games (which I would disagree that SS and even WW were ""lighthearted"" by any means).  Sure, it feels like it's been a while since TP because it came out so long ago, but it really wasn't that long ago as far as the number of games is concerned.  "
43037,"See my previous comment haha.  I think sometimes it's hard to see the bleak tone for the bright colors.  But even SS and WW had some bleaker moments, must like OoT."
43236,Nope.  The 3D games usually refer to the larger consul games (though I guess that term really should be updated since BW).  Between Worlds was a topdown 2D game that happened to have a 3D gimmick.  It's not the same level of game as the traditional 3D games.
49116,Shoot i have no idea why I said aunt haha. I'm very aware it's his grandma. Brain fart. 
97342,"I guess it's two different arguments.  Is something bleak because of the story or because of the method by which the story is told?  I'm sure it can be both and that it's a sliding scale.  You wouldn't watch a black comedy (which can usually be pretty bleak) and then use the word bleak to describe it necessarily.  You'd maybe say it was hilarious or kooky or ""too soon"" or whatever you'd say.  But you can have heavy subject matter presented in a lighthearted, colorful package and not feel the weight of the topics being presented.  And vice versa.  

MM feels more lighthearted than TP because of the package in which it's presented.  The story is heavier, the townsfolk live heavier lives, etc., sure.  But that doesn't come across as bleakly as TP does.  So it's sort of a discussion on which is actually more ""dark"" or mature or whatever.  I don't think there's really a right answer I guess, but I played MM as a kid when it first came out and never really felt all the sadness or picked up on the ""darkness"" of it.  It wasn't until I saw people talking about it that way online that I first thought about it.  Whereas TP wants you to think it's dark and heavy and bleak.  That was what it tried to make you feel from the get go.  

Again, I totally don't think there's a right or wrong answer, just topics for discussion.  I see that MM is heavier than I picked up on as a kid, for sure.  "
