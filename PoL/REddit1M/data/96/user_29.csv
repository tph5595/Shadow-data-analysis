30890,"I agree completely. A lifelike zelda game would piss me off. The art and colors and variations of these between games make them my favorite series, since I picked up the n64 remote. "

And I'm sure a realistic Zelda would fare quite well, but it would really bum me out. My own tastes though imagination and a set art style. Realism is certainly an art style, but it just doesn't catch my interest as much. Art does not need to mimic life to be a perfect work, and I hope dearly that Nintendo never thinks it does."
