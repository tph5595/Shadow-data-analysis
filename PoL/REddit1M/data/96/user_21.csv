Then the bulbulkins kidnap them and Link gets wrapped up in why he is in the world, along with saving his family. It also was a game that had side quests wrapped along with the main game. Fighting poes while you dungeon on, picking up some golden bugs on your journey, and even fishing was wrapped along with the main game. TP does indeed have some dark moments like when Lanyaru was explaining about the Triforce, or when Midna and the Light Guardians explained the events of the Twilight Realm, and even when Zant took control of Hyrule because Ganon infused his power with him. They were dark moments, but that doesn't make it a dark game."
