Pretty sure n64 done realisim justice at the time it was around. I also felt the same when I first played metroid prime on the GC. You sound like you are one to dislike titles like windwaker because sheer gfx in terms of realisim was scrapped in favor of detailed, emotion and story packed game play. This imo is what nintendo is about and why I will continue playing their games, if I want to look at something visually superior in terms of just gfx, I have my 1080 for that"
