64681,"Honestly I think when people say they're concerned about reusing an engine they mean reusing assets. If Zelda stays open world, Nintendo is definitely gonna want to reuse stuff to cut costs. That's not a slam on Nintendo, it's just a reality of any open world dev
"
64767,"I'd argue good animation enhances gameplay, it can help make things more clear to the player and make a character feel more natural to control
"
64808,"we're honestly past that point. Stylized realism is an art style of its own now, so stuff can still stand the rest of time with a realisitc aesthetic. It just took longer to get there
"
64854,"Twilight Princess is more realistic than Final Fantasy has ever been
"
64913,"honestly I feel like if Ocarina of Time were made with modenr technology you'd basically get a slighlty brighter twilight princess. They both share a very anime style
"
65001,"Realism doesn't mean no art or colour, despite how badly some devs botch it. If anything realistic effects can capture a level of beauty like some of the most stunning things in the real world. Except because it's digital they're not limited by our rules of nature, so they can make something exceptionally amazing.

Nintendo has a great art team, especially when it comes to Zelda, they cna pull it off
"
65054,"Well technically Wind Waker is also a post apocalyptic game, but BOTW seems to be lingering on it more. I'd say BOTW looks more dramatic than dark though.
"
65121,"top ten reason wind waker is the best: number one every other Zelda is worse number two it plays better number 3 it's 60 fps
"
65218,"its way darker and edgier. There's blood, a lot of explicit wounds, the world itself is a lot more grounded and desperate.

It tried to be a lot darker than the usual Zelda game
"
65253,"in what way? it's pure cartoon, it just uses somewhat realistic proportions"
65289,"lots of different kinds of dark, and honestly most Zelda games have SOMETHING that's dark, it's just usually not very explicit
"
65369,"art style is a pretty important factor in how a story will be percieved. Wind Waker's story is ""dark"" but the story is goofy and fun. A few implications and some scenes don't magically make the entire game dark
"
65453,"you don't have to be 13 to appreciate a different aesthetic.

Frankly, as much as I adore wind waker, I'm exhausted with similar looking Links. They used to make him look really different from game to game, but these days it's a constantly stream of cartoony styles with not much change."
65463,"change of pace
"
65597,"Ocarina isn't that lighthearted. It's not grimdark, it's just kinda... there. Like it takes itself seriously but it's not trying to hit you in the face with it.

Majoras' Mask though? Super dark, not very colourful. The entire game has an oppressive atmosphere. Eveyr NPC is affected by the events of the game. You don't get weird stuff where Ganondrof destroyed the world but there are people running mini games in the village slightly to the side.
"
65678,"I doubt you're getting a second game for the price of that DLC

it only includes one new dungeon, for one
"
65717,"well dark and gritty aren't the opposite of fun

they're the opposite of light and fluffy
"
65740,"WW has some dark moments but the entire atmosphere and feel of TP is dark
"
65927,"At the same time, zelda production overall has slowed down immensely. From 2000-2006 there were seven Zelda games released and they're all well regarded.

From 2007-2017? Six games, including BOTW, and it includes four of the lest regarded games in the franchise (Skyward Sword, Phantom Hourglass, Spirit Tracks and Triforce Heroes)
"
65958,"TP is beautiful though, the lighting is gorgeous, in a nontraditional sort of way

"
66000,"no, that's called an opinion.

You can think something is the worst even when others don't, you don't have to wait for literally everyone's approval
"
66099,"Well, it could mean a lot, depending on what the engine does. For example if it includes a lighting engine that'll have a HUGE impact on the aesthetic of the games it's used for
"
66244,"mimicking real lfie doesn't sacrifice creativity. You can have a giant crystal  coming ot of the ground with giant chains attached to it while waterfalls fall up into the sky around it and rainbows fly off in every direction and still make it look realistic
"
66297,"OoT 3D looks a lot like TP though, the only thing that really holds it back is that it's trying to stick with the shape of the models. If that wasn't a problem I think it'd look even more like TP
"
66331,"having edge doesn't make it not a cartoon. BOTW uses cel shading, which is a cartoon art style.
"
66410,"the character designs are weird, and apparently that was intentional, but I don't think they look great. But honestly I can't recall a Zelda game where I actually liked the NPC design overall. Maybe Wind Waker? But imo 3D Zelda NPC designs are too... weird.
"
67140,"which doesn't mean much becuase you spend most of the game watching Link smack his face into things. The King of Hyrule and Ganondorf don't get much screentime, not enough to hijack the tone of the entire game
"
67215,"it does boil down to it because cel shading is a cartoon style. Thus it's a cartoon. Wind Waker's proportions are a mark of cartoony art direction, but cel shading is straight up a cartoon exclusive lighting method
"
67822,"...did YOU play the game? You attribute Link smacking his face into things to me sucking at Wind Waker, one of the easiest Zeldas ever, and not the REPEATED gag when Link smacks into walls in cutscenes?

You're really exaggerating how much this ""dark"" stuff impacts the overall game

No, what? why are you pulling THAT out of nowhere? That literally doesn't make sense. Wind Waker has a handful of dark moments, and several dark undertones, but the game itself is lighthearted and adventurous.
"
67883,"no you're really not getting what I'm saying.

Cel shading means it's a cartoony style. Because that's what cel shading is. Ergo, BOTW's art style is cartoony (they specifically metioned being influenced by Ghibli animation)"
67952,"They're not exactly the same but thy're not THAT different
"
70520,"well now it's the reverse. Zelda has been nonstop cartoony for over ten years, and people want a break from that
"
104804,"the most prominent place is splattered on the gates of Kakariko Village, but I beleive there are a few other instances
"
144730,"what

it's literally red splotches on the spikes of the kakariko gate
"
