It has very little to do with the engine, and much more to do with the fact that Nintendo is probably never going to have a console powerful enough to do ""realism"" justice.

Art styles can look beautiful regardless of looking realistic or detailed.  Bob Ross makes beautiful art out of smacking a canvas with a two inch brush.

Realism requires specific detail, and specific details require high-end hardware unless you're willing to settle for decade-old graphics standards.  Nintendo will never go for realism until they have a console that can do is justice, because why would you do that when you can make something that looks beautiful, rather than something that looks dated?"
24504,"So anything that isn't realistic is a ""saturday morning cartoon""?  Painting has been a thing for as long as man has been a thing, and the most renowned artists are often in the least realistic/most exaggerated styles. 

I'll take the full potential of art relative to the hardware over some odd fear of being associated with cartooniness.  If anything, I think that anti-cartoon attitude is less mature than the cartooniness in question.  It reminds me of kids in elementary school pretending like ""Haha you like CARTOONS? What a baby!"" because they want to seem grown up.  It's... adolescent.

And what you're asking for is a semi-realistic/Twilight Princess-esque art style, yes, which would look nothing but dated in comparison to pretty much any other game that does the same thing.  Why ask for more dated looking visuals, when you can have something be gorgeous through art?  For the sake of realism/maturity?  You'd ask something to restrain its artistic potential - to essentially look *worse* than it can - for the sake realism?  That's just backwards.

Personally, I think TP is probably the most boring looking Zelda game relative to its age.  90% faded, fuzzy greenish browns. When it came out, there were already many games in similar styles that absolutely blew it away.  Realism has *never* been impressive on low-end hardware."
25354,"&gt;I didn't use the word realistic. 

But you cited Twilight Princess, which is by far the most realistic Zelda game and is always brought up with realism related desires.

&gt;OK this is just strawman projections. I like cartoons. I liked Wind Waker as a game. I didn't call anyone a baby. Chill bud.

I said it's what it reminded me of.  What exactly is so wrong with something looking like a cartoon?  The only logic behind that I can find is what I described.

&gt;You keep equating TP with realism. Have you looked at TP lately? It doesn't look like real life to me.

But it certainly tries to look more realistic than the rest, and those are Nintendo's own sentiments on the matter.  You talked of cartooniness as a non-desire, and cite a game that is regarded as the most realistic, so what else am I to assume other than you want realism?"
89279,"&gt;One of the biggest criticisms towards WW

Which is widely regarded as one of the stupidest things to ever involve itself with Zelda, and in hindsight WW is regarded as the best-aging Zelda game.  It's a paper thin criticism. "
90681,"I never said anybody was wrong.  I described why I think people have this opinion, and provided the counterpoint opinion.

All in all, the topic is relative to why Nintendo doesn't go with realism anymore.  You can have something impressive through art, or you can have something that attempts realism and is easily beaten out by the options with better hardware.

When Nintendo releases a console with impressive hardware, I will welcome a realistic Zelda, because it can be done justice.  Until then, I will strongly opposite it because it will only look like what most other games are doing, except worse."
269812,"...What are you talking about?

&gt;Pretty sure n64 done realisim justice at the time it was around

20 years ago, yes, Nintendo produced powerful consoles (relative to the time).  Now, they do not.  Without relatively powerful hardware, realism does not look good.

&gt;You sound like you are one to dislike titles like windwaker

I am literally defending titles like Wind Waker because they look beautiful *without* requiring powerful hardware.  My entire point is that realism isn't even necessary, because you can make even better looking games without it.

Sounds to me like you thought I was talking down on Nintendo.  No.

I was making the point that Nintendo uses lower-end hardware.  On low end hardware, realism does not look good, but games like Wind Waker or Breath of the Wild *always* look good through art, rather than hardware.

The point is that Nintendo doesn't do realism because they don't have to, as an art style like BotW looks *better* without requiring a 1080."
