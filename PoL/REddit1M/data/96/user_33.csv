34440,"I agree on OoT, but not on MM.  *Majora's Mask* was very dark due to a number of reasons.  All zelda games have impending doom, but in MM it was so much more visible, and would actually happen if you did nothing unlike in other games.  The resetting of the 3 day period meant that every kind act and side quest that you did for others was reversed, and you saw the NPCs back in their same old predicaments, which was somewhat demoralizing.  And by the end of it (if you finish as the fierce deity) you became a fairly non-heroic character, or at least they portrayed you as that.  

imo, though, *Link's Awakening* was the darkest, because [you struggle for so long and it wasn't even real.](/spoiler)"
