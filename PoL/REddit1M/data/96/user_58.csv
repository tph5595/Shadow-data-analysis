90876,i don't think they look very similar at all
95863,"are you sure it's not just because you were really young when you first played it that you feel like WW is dark? 

WW has its dark moments, but as a console zelda it is one of the lightest in the series. sure, it has things like kidnapping, ghosts, and references to a rainpocalypse... but a lot of things turn out fine for everyone and it's all presented cute comic-book style (i'm not talking about just the art style but even the way scenes are directed)."
96325,"TP is ... relatively close to ""realistic"" when compared with other zelda games.

that being said, it can hardly be called ""realistic"" without the comparison being made..."
96536,"having lighthearted and colorful elements does not really make it lighthearted and colorful. twilight princess would win by default simply by being dully greyish.

MM is by far the darkest zelda game. the whole game is about lingering emotional pain. and then the final day is designed to kill your nerves, completing with the moon crashing and obliterating everything in a massive inferno if you let the time pass. that's all ON TOP of the emotional drama that manifests visually/physically throughout the games towns, fields, dungeons, etc."
96932,"THE LIGHTING IS FANTASTIC. especially faron woods. i wish the faron woods were much larger and more important because they are my favorite area atmospherically in the game (along with the ice mansion, but visually the mansion is not as beautiful)"

first i bet we'll see something visually similar to BotW (perhaps a multiplayer zelda worthy of original four swords greatness while echoing many characteristics/physics/etc of BotW),

then after that i bet we'll see a bigger evolution with very different art direction."
