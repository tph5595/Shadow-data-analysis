43919,"I honestly have not a single idea as to why anyone would ever want to go back to a Twilight Princess looking game.

Easily the worst art style in the series imo."
46193,"Yeah, I know but it's just SO ugly to me that it's hard to see where people who like it are coming from, you know?

As for football vs football, I don't really follow either, but European Football would be much better if it wasn't for the flopping."
46769,"I'm curious as to why you lump Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask with TP.

They have totally different art styles. OoT and MM are more anime-ish, and brighter"
47193,"If people don't like cartoony graphics, they probably still don't like TP's artstyle.

The characters are all oddly proportioned, and still look pretty cartoony.

By flopping, I mean people falling over and pretending to be hurt. It really damages the integrity of the sport."
63400,"I mean, I did also add that it was my opinion.

It's not like I just sat here and said that I believe it to be objectively the worst."
65797,"I don't think so.

I think that you would end up with it looking a lot like OoT 3D.

The reason I think this, is the official art for the two games. OoT's art looks a lot like OoT 3D ended up looking like, and it's quite different to that of Twilight Princess. I think the reason some people think that OoT would look like TP is because of the technical limitations of OoT make it look similarily drab."

But the character designs, and muddy colour pallet are just not great. Even the Twilight Realm, though it looks pretty neat, wasn't great from a practical stand point, as it made it hard to see things a lot of the time."
67407,I disagree. They're very different looking games.
68454,"Just to  double check, I looked up some screenshots to see if I wasn't just misremembering.

The're pretty different."
