62990,"I agree. I never want something realistic. Now something dark to change things up ala Twilight Princess, I would be into. Even thought I do prefer the SS/BOTW kind of styles. It's always nice to do something darker every once in a while. 

Hell even that shiny tech demo they showed for the Wii U wasn't even realistic. I could see something like that for a darker tone maybe? 

But again I would never want Link or Zelda to look like humans. Games like Tomb Raider and what not are beautiful, but in a few years they look dated. Hell even now realistic games creep me out. It's that whole uncanny valley kinda thing. Too unreal looking but too real looking. "
63079,I'm glad they didn't but I would welcome something in this direction for the next iteration for sure. I wouldn't mind something visually darker and creepier after SS and BOTW.
