You failed.

Hyrule is gone.

Those who remained longed for it and tried to resurrect it in their own ways.

They failed.

""you spend most of the game watching Link smack his face into things"" ~You

Define 'most'.

&gt; No, what? why are you pulling THAT out of nowhere? That literally doesn't make sense.

Um... context, please?

&gt; Wind Waker has a handful of dark moments, and several dark undertones, but the game itself is lighthearted and adventurous.
