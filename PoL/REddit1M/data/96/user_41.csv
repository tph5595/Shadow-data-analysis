42743,OOT had both sides to it and blended them very well. I'd just love another game that has the bleaker side to it at all. Its been a while.
42868,"OOT had both lighthearted and bleak parts to it. Remember Castle Town as an adult? Ganon's Castle? It got very serious/dark at times. Its not that the colorful stuff is bad in my opinion, but we've just gone without *any* of the opposite style for quite a long time now. It'd be nice to see some of it."
43090,Doesnt Between Worlds count as 3D?
43412,"Im not talking about the tone though. Every game has dark/serious plot points. Im talking about the atmosphere. The music, the colors, the setting, are what mostly set the atmosphere imo. Windwaker had *very* few moments like this, mostly in the forsaken fortress... SS had... the bottom of the Ancient Cistern? Thats all I can think of.
