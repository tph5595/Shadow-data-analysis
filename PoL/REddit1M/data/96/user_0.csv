0,
11127,yeah thats my point
18744,i liked OoT and Tp. i dont think we need a colorful Zelda everytime
18769,Nothing. But not everyone understands that. And thats fine. 
20361,dont be cocky. that has nothing to do with stupidness
31185,but not as bright as windwaker or botw. 
35006,"well, it is really obvious that i am talking about artwork in this case. just look at this thread :D"
35048,this is about the artwork son
36194,i am talking 100% about the graphics. every zelda has a dark story since its always about the destruction of Hyrule/the earth
37636,"i think its more atmospheric. TP and OoT have the best atmospheres in my opinion. I do like Wind Waker and Skyward Sword the most, but i like it, that we get different art styles in the Zelda franchise"
39871,BotW was in development for 4 years now. They had problems with the physics engine. They probably reuse the engine with the next game so they dont have to start from the groud up. we may see on in 2020. Aonuma said its possible to see another Zelda game on the Switch. 
45756,"It comes down to personal taste. I really like TPs artstyle.

But i dont understand why people watch something as boring as american football when european football (soccer) exist"
45872,I dont get your point. Do you think we are not allowed to discuss or judge a games artstyle?
46786,"There ar people who just dont like cartoon graphics that much. There are people right know who dont even take botw serious because of horizon and mass effect. how can someone not see that :D

My english is not that good. What do you mean by ""if it wasnt for the flopping""?"
73037,"Yes because,  as you can see its very colorful, cartoonish and bright in its artstyle"

Wind Waker: [here](http://orig00.deviantart.net/f528/f/2011/222/b/6/wind_waker_princess_zelda_by_toonprincesszelda43-d4648wn.png)

Would you not say that the TP approach is the more realistic design?"
86802,"mocap animations often lowers gameplay in terms of responsiveness.

Look at Wind Waker and Super Mario (anything). The animations are short and unrealistic. thats the basis for responsive gameplay. then you look at mocap games like Beyond Two souls where you cant have good movement just because of the fact that they heavily use mocap. 

I dont want to hate on mocap. mocap is great in games that benefits from it. but in a gameplay/movement focused game like super mario and zelda, i dont want mocap.
"
100665,"i dont like that game. i tried to play it 3 times but cant finish it because i get bored. Last time i tried was a year ago and i stopped at the water temple. 

I dont think this game is that atmospheric because the epicness isnt there. you are just a guy fighting with another guy about a mask"
