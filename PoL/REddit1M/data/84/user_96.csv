38092,I just beat the water temple on ocarina of time master quest on gc. This is what i wanted the most from the 3ds remake
38154,Musical instrument? Where'd that come from buddy
38226,"Hahahha yup and also, sometimes it's not too bad and you put up with the stretch "
38251,"You can put up with it in some games, not really movies at all"
38299,Just beat the water temple in it. Different but not too hard at all yet
38323,What's bruv one of my homies says it too
38420,"Man we must be opposites. I can't believe you enjoy the 2d games, they seem bland to me. Don't get me wrong, i love golden sun and i thought it had excellent story. But 2d zelda games... Idk maybe ill have to give one a shot again"
38444,Isnt that a contradiction 
38523,What makes that your favorite? 
39102,"Hey, for an object to be a musical instrument to me, it should more often than not make its own sound ðŸ˜‚"
76764,What are second and first
76815,I think minish or Oracle but i stopped after like 10 mins because the 3d just felt so much stronger
77206,"Instead of wind waker, go twilight princess instead, i liked it more. But either is a good choice"
341492,Twilight princess was revolutionary to me with excellent graphics and a mood/tone that i enjoyed very much
