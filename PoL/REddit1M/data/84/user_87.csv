31279,"How is it not a GCN version if it is on its own printed, official GCN disk? Like I get it's being emulated, but it is modified (both the textures and the engine itself) and therefore more of a port. Not to mention the addition of Master Quest, which was supposed to be Gamecube-exclusive. There are plenty of games that, in order to save dev time, opted for emulation for certain ports rather than a native implementation, and you would still consider them a ""&lt;insert platform&gt; version"". It's definitely a confusing situation because the extracted Master Quest ROM works on the N64 if you put it on a cartridge, but the GCN disc contains more than just the ROM."
