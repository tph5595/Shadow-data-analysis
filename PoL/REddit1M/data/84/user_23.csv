So much nostalgia.
For myself, the latest Zelda game I've played was majora's mask.
That was when I was 9 or so.
Shit.. the feels, man..
Need to get me one of those new consoles...
My wife and her brewing baby will be fine......

XD  

I'm just kidding. Though seriously I haven't gotten past Majora's Mask. 
Working my way that way, though.
Wasn't impressed with what I saw of Wind Walker.
Skyward Sword came out and I was too consumed in work to realize how much of the franchise was moving forward.

Here we are with a map comparable to Elder Scrolls and holy crap I want this Switch!!!"
