62996,"I'm not going to post any links to it to be extra safe re: the rom-sharing rules, but there's a patch for Master Quest out there called Voyager of Time that changes the dungeons and where the items are in major ways. I tried it, and it does a *very* good job at making you feel like you're twelve and have no idea what you're doing again.

Now, that's only if you have a *legally-acquired* rom of Master Quest, of course. I wouldn't want to look like I'm condoning piracy here. Surely with the money raised by selling your testicle, you can buy a genuine copy of the game and a cart reader?"
