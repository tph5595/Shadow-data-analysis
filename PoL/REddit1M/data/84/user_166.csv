132681,"I realise the impracticality of it now you're no doubt deep into it, but the best version of this game really is the 3DS version. The Wii/Wii U VC version is a direct N64 port and can be a little harder to look at in 2017 for a first-timer. It runs at the original 20fps frame-rate and everything, where as the 3DS version has had big texture and model upgrades, runs at a higher framerate and lots of quality of life tweaks.

Basically, Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker and Twilight Princess (The first two are 3DS exclusives, the latter two are Wii U exclusives) have all had remastered versions that outstrip their original versions to some degree. There's no advantage in being a purist if you can avoid it!

If you can't source a 3DS it's probably worth emulating, also.

EDIT: LTTP also had a tweaked version released with Four Swords (for GBA) but that's also a tough one to source."
