70022,"Really surprised to see a handful of anons say this is low on their list of favourites. I keep my opinion to myself typically, but I'm so thankful to know I'm not alone! Started when the original released &amp; LttP will always be my favourite- though BotW is right next to it now, too. 

OP enjoy every minute of it! Don't let Navi kill your nerves!"
