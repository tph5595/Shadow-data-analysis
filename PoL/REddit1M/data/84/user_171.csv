I love how difficult some of the puzzles and steps can be because once you solve something it is quite rewarding, especially when you've been trying for a while on one thing. I love the hidden secrets throughout, the weapons, there's not much to complain about. The best part is I feel like these games can be just as enjoyed by a 40 year old as they can be by a 10 year old, looking forward to playing the more recent games in the future! "
