32558,OOT = greatest game of all time. 🐐
118530,"BOTW was very good and did a lot of things very well. Obviously there were some technical limitations due to OOT coming out in the 90s, but I just feel that OOT is better overall and harder imo. I actually may put Windwaker above BOTW too as my second favorite Zelda game..wasn't a fan of Majors Mask though..the whole time cycle thing ruined it for me."
