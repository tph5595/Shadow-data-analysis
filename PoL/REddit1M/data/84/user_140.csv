62861,The beginning of OOT is pretty quick.. what part are you referring to?
63845,"Eh, it's pretty quick imo. It'll take a kid a while but you can be done with that in under 30 minutes, takes around 10 if you have done it before."
66437,"Meh, to me it's not that slow. It pretty much encourages a lot of exploration. It's not as quick as botw or zelda 1, but I would be hard pressed to call it long."
82346,Correct. TP and SS have really long tutorial sections. OP even updated us and said he had the slingshot in 45 min.
