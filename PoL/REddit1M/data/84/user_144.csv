64903,"Poor control schemes? You customize both action buttons for situational needs, you move on a 2 dimensional axis so a 4 directional pad is really the best option(the other option was the 8 direction sega master system controller, which was a mess.) and the start button also brings up a menu so you can do more than pause. I mean, is your argument that the NES is a bad controller? Is that honestly something you can fault the original Legend of Zelda for?

I suppose you could ding it for not holding your hand like modern video games, but controls are honestly the one thing that I don't understand complaining about in terms of these games. You virtually could map whatever you wanted to."
