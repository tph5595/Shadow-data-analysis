Master Quest was also originally developed for the N64DD, and is just a re-arrangement of assets. You can take the ROM for Master Quest out of the GCN version and it will run on a real N64 via an EverDrive.

Similarly, Animal Crossing isn't a GCN game, it's an N64 game being emulated on the Gamecube."
