28881,"English is not my first language, so when I played this game as a kid,  I had to rely on guides to play it, because I didn't understand the in-game hints to the puzzles, I really loved the game and became a fan ever since, but I realized later that I really didn't experience the game they way it was meant to be, maybe one day I'll beat the remastered version, and try the mastery quest. 

On the plus side, the desire of trying to understand the game was a great motivation to learn English. "
