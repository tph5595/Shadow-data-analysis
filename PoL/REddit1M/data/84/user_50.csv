21630,"So... juuuuuuust in case you decide this game isn't for you... I'd recommend still trying out a 2d Zelda game... and I'd recommend that game be Link Between Worlds. I know it's an unpopular opinion but I've tried Oot twice and it just isn't for me. Then I tried Link Between Worlds, loved it, and have since played four 2d Zelda games. "

Also if you haven't give Link Between Worlds a go. Great game. I really liked Minish Cap as well."
109881,I plan on trying both. TP actually is 2nd on the list of 3D Zelda games to play.
