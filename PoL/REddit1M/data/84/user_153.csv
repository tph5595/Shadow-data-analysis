The original NES game or A Link to the Past are a much better introduction to the series, in my opinion. It doesn't even have a lot to do with the fact that Ocarina of Time is one of my least favorites.

However, I am glad you're making your first foray into the series. Hopefully you like it enough to play more games in the series."

69374,This is how I feel about A Link to the Past.

On top of that, trying being someone who hates, loathes and despises Final Fantasy 10."

837753,Plus the Demise fights were frustrating because he's so damned big and it's impractical to damage him in one place but need to damage him again in another within a very small window of time.
