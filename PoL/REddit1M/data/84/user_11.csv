11269,"Please, please, please report back after a couple of hours of gameplay and let us old timers know what you think. I'd love to know OoT really still holds up today from someone not jaded by their first experience with it back in 98. 

Happy trails!"
96339,"What parts did you feel weren't coherent? I could see that, but OoT was sort of the first of its kind, (3D dungeon and overworld design) so it'd make sense if some parts felt less than polished. "
96464,"Agreed, but I don't think OoT would've worked in the day without the slow buildup. It essentially reworked the entire design scheme of not only Zelda games, but adventure games in general, so closing off Kokiri Forest and having a dungeon located within is a great tutorial for the (for its day) massive overworld. There is also some exploration of areas like lost woods. "
96680,"Damn you Miyamoto, I can hear it too. "
96783,Why'd you put a box in a box?
96912,VII's graphics aged like shit but the game is still damn near perfect all these years later. 
159957,"Well, I was thinking by a couple of hours they'd know if they like it or not. I don't think it is fair to tell someone they can't not like a game if they haven't spent 10 hours or more on it. I'd say in an hour or two, you should know if you are enjoying the game or not. 

Might also be because OoT isn't really that long if you've played it before/know what you are doing, and I've been watching a ton of speedruns of it recently. But of course, for a first time playthrough, it could easily last 30-40 hours to do everything, maybe longer without any guides or what have you. "

What do you think about the game? Like, what works and what doesn't?"
7490243,"Ah, I love the comment about puzzles. I've solved them several times so I sort of instinctually know the puzzles. Good to know they are still challenging. "
