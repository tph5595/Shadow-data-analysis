5751,So I'm trying to get some horns to upgrade the champions shirt and I've set up base at the lake hylia bridge but faroosh is refusing to turn up regardless of when I camp till. I've seen videos on YouTube saying either morning or night garenteed but neither are working. Am I doing something wrong? 
6570,I'll give it a shot thanks. Another thing to add. Can I get the horn on my first go? I saw something about having to do a shrine first involving the scale or is that false?
