8076,"&gt; There are certain unique items that can be repaired

There are no items that can be repaired.  The Champion weapons can be *remade*, the Hylian shield can be *repurchased* if it breaks or is lost, the Master Sword *recharges* but nothing can be *repaired*.

It's a small distinction, but important, as claiming that anything can be 'repaired' just further compounds confusion.  There is no repair system in the game for any item.  "
