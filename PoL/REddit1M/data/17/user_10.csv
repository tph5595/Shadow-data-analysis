1859,"NOTE: the spoiler below lists a location, but it's neither story-based nor intuitive so you decide if you want to hover.

There is a specific type of elixir that an NPC sells you [at the stable directly east-southeast of Eldin Tower (Foothill). I recommend buying 3 - that should be enough to get you to Goron City where you can buy fire-resistant gear](/spoiler). 

For cold-resistant, there is a shop in Rito Village that sells you attire.

Addendum to the spoiler: [there's a difference in the game between heat-proof and fire-proof (so don't make the same mistake I did, ha)](/spoiler)."

Lots of ore here, too!"
5596,"I haven't actually made it to the Divine Beast yet, but the Flight Range is sort of the ""pre-requisite activity"" for Teba to trust you. 

You have 3 minutes to hit 5 targets in what might very well be the easiest 'pre-req activity' in the game. You can release the paraglider to fall towards lower targets, but it truly isn't necessary."
34137,I just had a spa day and I'm gonna get real weird with it.
