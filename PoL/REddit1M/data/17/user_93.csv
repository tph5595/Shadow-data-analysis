22724,"Like /u/bunnysnack said, almost every picture has some pretty identifiable landmarks. In some of them the one landmark from a certain angle is good enough, for instance the picture that has the split mountain in it with a lake in the foreground can only be in one very specific and narrow area (because it's in line with the split in the mountain). Some of them you'll need to compare multiple landmarks, if Hyrule castle is to the left, the lost woods to the right and the flying divine beast is straight ahead then there's only one specific area it could be in. 

The picture hunting was actually my favourite part of the game, perfect excuse to get players exploring an open world with an eye for detail."
