You should be able to know when you have blown up all the rock formations because the wind funnel that forms afterwards is immensely strong. The wind stream you need to ride doesn't start at Kass it ends at him.

I won't spoil anything but I will say it is by far the easiest divine beast and gives you the best ability in the game in my opinion anyway. Once you have that power traveling is sooo much more enjoyable. Glad I could help!

Like I have the Wii u Version and have the occasional pop-in or lag (usually involves using statis around areas that have larger particle effects like the snowy areas or volcano region). But nothing major whatsoever, game looks good.

If you have neither system I'd just wait and buy the Switch. No reason to buy a system that is no longer being supported for Zelda. I got the Wii u Version simply because I already owned a Wii u. Both versions are great though."

Rito is never not useful. Gerudo makes any boss fight a breeze if you save up your charges and can execute it properly. Also very good against Hinoxs since they are always sleeping so you can easily charge up for a lot of damage."
