5813,"Spoilers for the Ganon fight ahead! 


Is there any way to deactivate the 4 divine beasts? 

I don't mean the abilities. In the fight itself they [cut down half of Ganons HP in the first phase] (/spoiler) which is really a disappointment, so I want to kill him without theire help and do you know if it changes anything if i beat him without them?"
