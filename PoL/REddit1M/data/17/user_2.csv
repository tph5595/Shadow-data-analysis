1039,"I don't like not being able to figure something out, but I am utterly stymied here, so I'd like the least amount of gently-nudging help possible:

Master of the Winds shrine quest. [I blew up...I think three different rock formations. I'm pretty sure there are no more to be blown up, because I've circled around the area two dozen times. But none of the wind streams pass anywhere near the ""altar"" that I need to land on â€“ the winds are all south of the altar by a fair margin. Obviously gliding onto the altar from up the mountain away from the winds doesn't work. I think I'm just not clear on exactly what needs to be accomplished. There's a wind stream that starts next to Kass, which suggests I need to ride it and try to ride all the subsequent streams without touching the ground...but...this gets me nowhere. I'm lost and not sure what needs to be done. I've been done a heckin bamboozle, you might say. Help?](/spoiler)"

3778,This definitely makes it sound like I've missed a blow-up-able rock...somehow. Will be very curious to get home and try this again.
