10032,Any tips on how to do his dumb sidequest? The only dialogue options I have with her are to rent a room.

20280,"Good idea! I haven't found those shrines/puzzles yet, but that's an idea. Wish I could remember how I made them. This is such a great game that I feel like I've been playing for way longer than just a week. Especially with how much there is to explore and find. "
