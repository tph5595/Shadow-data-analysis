78275,"Once you have unlocked all the wind streams, climb up on top of the arch stucture facing the landing pad, and glide from above the strongest stream towards the landing pad - it's a straight shot riding the strongest wind.

You MUST have the glider open when you touch down - if you cancel the glide to fall directly onto it, the shrine will not unlock.  You will get reach the pad with room to spare - just keep gliding until you land.  This was the problem I kept running into - cancelling early.

I did the same thing that you did trying to follow the wind stream next to Kass in a single loop - I was never able to accomplish it fully, but was getting close enough that it ""seemed"" right.  Nope!  Just glide straight from the top of the nearest arch."
