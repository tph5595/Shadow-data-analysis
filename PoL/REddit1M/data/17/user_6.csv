1380,"Anyone has locations of respawning elemental weapons? I know Hyrule Castle has all 3 Great Elemental Blades that respawn every blood moon, and a Moblin has a Flameblade at Great Eldin Skeleton, but I'm looking for Frostspear specifically. "

EDIT: And your defence too, more means less damage taken, if you want to avoid being one-shot."
1702,In the beginning I just stasis+ them if I can't get into a comfortable position to shield parry their laser. Now I'm at the point of having more than enough ancient arrows I just rely on them mostly for any guardians I come across.
3125,"Yes that's the most common standard spot, and it's one time only. But like I said, I'm looking for respawnable ones like the ones monsters carry, so you can get them again when blood moon comes."
3850,"Yes it's in the chest of that shrine, one time unfortunately."
3876,"Thanks I just cleared out that place but they have no elemental weapons equipped, will go back and check it again after blood moon."
