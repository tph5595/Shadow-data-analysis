1232,"Don't spoil it for me if I get it from something story based, but where will I find/buy high cold/heat resistant gear?  I know I can eat food to do it but I'd like to go places like death mountain without having to rely on food alone."
1644,"So do I need to go into the heat area first to buy it?  Like would I need to eat heat resistant food to get to the shop where I buy heat resistant gear?  If so that's great just want to make sure I'm not out here expecting to find the gear anywhere else lol.  This game is huge I still haven't explored it all

Also I liked the riddle style answer haha"
2367,"Cool, thanks for the help!  Still much less spoiler'ish than if I had googled it I'm sure lol"
2532,"Sweet, thanks for the info!"
2551,Thanks!
2982,"I found a frost spear last night, at least I'm pretty sure that's what it was.  It froze people lol

[On top of Mount Lanayru you have to fight a big dragon, you'll need arrows.  There was a chest I got up there that gave me the frost spear.  There is also a shrine once you beat it so you can go back immediately whenever you need to.](/spoiler)"
3396,Oh is it one time?  I thought everything like that respawned with the blood moon.  Thought it was in a chest but I may be remembering it wrong.
4073,"I gave in and got it for the Wii U because I'm too impatient to wait for a Switch.  I've had almost no problems whatsoever, I've seen VERY few dips in framerate, maybe 2-3 times since I got the game.  Get it, get it now, fall in love with it.  It was developed for Wii U anyways and just upscaled for the Switch.

Edit: I Just noticed you didn't have a Wii U, thought you already had one.  If you're buying a new console either way, then you may want to get switch since Wii U is pretty much over at this point."
4285,"I love Bolson (guy who you buy the house from).  All of their ""credos"" for each time you upgrade the house were enjoyable lol.  Hippie looking dude in pink clothes attacking your house to fix it up."
4339,Bummer I thought chests in shrines respawned with bloodmoon as well.
7183,So what exactly does and does not respawn with the blood moon?  I thought chests in shrines did but I guess not.  I know enemies respawn and I believe all the chests out in the open world.  Anything I'm missing?
7590,Would like to know as well.  All the names of the shrine monks seem to be Egyptian themed though I could be wrong.  Would definitely like to know more about their lore.
9020,"I've had a few items as well that did the same thing, commenting here so I can come back and check the answer."
15234,"Yeah you should be able to, my brother plays it on the gamepad a lot when I'm watching stuff."
15264,"I assumed they will leave once I buy everything, makes me want to hold off on buying the final display lol."
15589,Really good to know!  Those weapons are beast.  Do they do more damage against guardians?  I haven't looked but it seemed like they did.
16350,"Cool, thanks!"
22870,"I read a tip that made me able to land it 90% of the time.  They make a short ""beep"" right before they fire, push you're parry RIGHT after the beep.  Don't try and judge it by watching the laser blasts because it's too quick.  I was able to kill multiple guardians with this tip, still fail sometimes, but that beep is the perfect set up."
