3609,"There is no such shield.

Closest you have is the Hylian shield which is pretty resistant. You get it in Hyrule Castle.

Once it breaks you can buy it again in the city you help build."
3745,"What problem are you speaking of? If you have a Wii U, this version is really a good way to enjoy the game if you don't mind the dip in framerate. I know the framerate on the Switch is better and I didn't hear about other real problems.

If you know you'll get a Switch anyway, it's your call. But I'm playing on Wii U and it's absolutely fine."

9953,They don't matter as much for exploration as the Gale Wind.
11323,"Nope, they are dropped by Guardians and found in shrines. If you need help with the Guardians: [You can perfect parry their lasers with any shield. You can cut the legs of the spider Guardians with any cutting weapon. An arrow in the eye will stun them. If you get a X3 or X5 bow, it only uses 1 arrow while launching more projectiles so use your non standard arrow against them. And obviously, ancient arrow in the eye is the fastest way to dispatch a Guardian.](/spoiler)"

18483,"It's the only way to farm them beside the Zelda amiibo.

32241,There is a seller selling unique stuff you could have sold or lost.
39044,"They get harder everytime you kill them. They ""rank up"" so you may spawn a silver Bokoblin instead of a red one if you killed a lot of Bokoblins.

And no you can't turn off the blood moon."
40421,"Stop killing enemies.

Get better armor."
43466,"Easiest way is to make your way to the Rito village, they sell warm clothes."
