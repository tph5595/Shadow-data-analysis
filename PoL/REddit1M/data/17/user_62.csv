15306,"Does anyone know if monsters not dropping certain parts is a bug or a design choice? Like the whole reason I'm fighting a Hinox is for the guts and they don't drop. Or how Lizalfos don't always drop a tail, even though I'm watching the fucker dance around with one.

Edit: 2 Blue and 3 Red Lynels later and not a single one drops guts. If this is by design it sucks.  "
15590,Yeah just like it won't recognize and track monster parts. Anything that comes from a monster/animal you need to take a picture of the animal. 
16996,That's a bummer. I didn't think they'd do that with the mini-bosses too. Thanks.
19258,If you want an easy one there's a girl at Outskirt Stable that gives you one if you show her the master sword.
