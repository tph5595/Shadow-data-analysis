16359,One of my favorite characters is Traysi (I think that's her name). She writes all the stories you find in the stables.
16960,There's a cool side quest from a guy on the plateau near the stable in Tabantha. Do his quest and farosh will appear where it takes you in the morning around 6am. Dinraal appears in that same location close to the same time. It's pretty cool seeing both at the same time.
