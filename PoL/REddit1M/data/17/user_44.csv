8903,"I can't seem to add certain items to my compendium. For example I wanted to add Chickaloo Tree Nut so I could find more of them, but it won't recognize it when I try to take the picture of it no matter what I do. What's happening here?"
9196,"It doesn't even have the ???, it's just not giving me anything at all. It's as if I were pointing it at nothing..."
9640,"Yes :( it will recognize the majority of items, but I've noticed a few won't be identified, like this one. I must be doing something wrong though because haven't other people completed the compendium? It won't take no matter what I try. I keep putting it on a bunch of different floors/tables/etc but nothing has worked, not even restarting the game. Thanks for the reply"
11932,"Hmm, that's definitely possible I guess. But what makes this item different from others that it can't be registered? It's a cooking ingredient. But maybe that is the case after all. "
16141,Oh...this might be the answer. I had one of the tree nuts but didn't know how I got it. I didn't know drops didn't count towards the compendium!
