6760,Is there a way to repair durability for weapons? I read somewhere how there's someone who replaces a special shield if broken so it got me thinking... Is there a repairman for other weapons? 
7982,"What unique weapons are available to be repaired? I've done a lot of exploring and have only started reclaiming the divine beasts and just got Naboris last night. I assume the special scimitar is the ""unique"" weapon that can be placed? "
8983,Okay awesome! Thank you for that! 
9021,Okay! I apologize for the error in diction! But thanks for clarifying! â˜º
