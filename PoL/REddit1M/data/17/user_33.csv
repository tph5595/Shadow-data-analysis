6081,"Question about a key sword (stop reading if you don't want minor spoiler):

In short, my master sword has never recovered from low energy. I was going for all the towers and the section with the master sword was the second to last section I explored, so I was able to get it. I then immediately left that section looking for the last tower. I used the Master Sword on a few enemies before it said ""low on energy."" It has not recovered its energy. I have probably played for 10 hours since then, and it's still low on energy. Did I miss something? Was I supposed to do more where the sword is located to ensure that it can regenerate? Any help would be appreciated. Thanks."
6306,"Thanks. I'll try that. It just says ""low on energy"" for me currently and I stopped using it immediately. I've been trying to figure it out for days and never thought about using it more. It makes sense though because it still actually has some energy. "
6380,Thanks a lot! Quite a relief hearing this after multiple days of trying to figure it out and being afraid to use it any more. 
7023,Awesome. That takes a load off my mind.
