59705,"I've completed all the Shrine Quests and the extra quest The Hero's Cache, but Kass is still acting like he hasn't learned all the songs yet and as such isn't appearing in Rito Village. Any tips?"
60750,"My Adventure Log reads 42/42 Shrine Quests Cleared. And yes, I know for a fact I did that one."
64939,"No that's what the part of the menu where you see all your quests is called, the one on the far left. Beating the game and loading the clear save does let you know how many quests you've cleared in each category out of the total amount."
76871,Yes. Considering that I've completed every single Shrine quest. Kinda hard to do without talking to him everywhere.
76882,"Yep, have the star next to my save file and everything."
105233,I don't believe it does. And yes he's at the stable saying he still needs to learn all the songs before he can return home.
105407,"Yeah but the game tells me I've done every single Shrine Quest, 42/42. "
106099,I've beaten the game with all 4 Divine Beasts cleared. All 42/42 Shrine Quests cleared too. Also his Hero's Cache quest. He tends to vanish after you enter the shrines related to each of his quests. The only place I can find him now is outside Rito Stable where he says he needs to learn all the songs and just does the one about Calamity Ganon.
107017,"Well I checked his journal and compared all the locations listed to the quest names.

Checked the Pagos Woods. Not there. Near Jeddo Bridge, also gone. Rabia Plain, Gerudo Tower, Calora Lake, Horon Lagoon, Kitano Bay, and Washa's Bluff... Not anywhere there. 

Then I head back to Rito Village and the birdbrain is waiting for me.

REALLY KASS"
107540,"Honestly I think it might be time of night. I'd been hearing you need to talk to him at night but it was just before dawn when I returned.

Kinda reloaded the most recent autosave so I could show the song to my fiance and am hoping this is the case."
107993,"Okay so my old save was before I'd finished revisiting everywhere. Went to Rito Village at about 1:30AM in-game, he's not there, wait and he doesn't appear.

I revisit everywhere I haven't revisited already to look for him, warp back to Rito Village at 3AM in-game, and he's waiting.

Not sure if revisiting was a part of it or not, but he was definitely there at 3AM, and he won't appear there if you wait by showing up early."
