31973,"The regular ones don't really do anything but the colored ones are used to upgrade armor later on and also have specific qualities. For example, red has fire so you can use it to light a campifire or something. White has power of ice. Yellow has the power of electricity. You can turn regular blue jelly into the other ones by applying that element to them. So if you put some jelly on a campfire, it'll turn into red. If you drop some into freezing water or a cold environment it'll turn to white. "
