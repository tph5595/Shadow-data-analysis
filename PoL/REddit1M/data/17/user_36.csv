For the guardians that walk around though, I no longer do this.  You can kill each leg individually and each leg will drop an extra part or two.  In addition, killing a leg stuns the guardian and does damage to it, so it's close to death by the time the legs are gone, and its just a couple swings to finish it.

Takes like 30 seconds longer than an ancient arrow, but gets like double the drops..though I probably also do it because those guys went out of their way to make my early life more painful, so I need to return the favor."
