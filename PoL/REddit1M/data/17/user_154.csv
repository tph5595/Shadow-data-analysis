63522,"So there seems to be an upper and lower part of the castle. I've explored the lower part that is blocked off from the upper. When I tried to reach the upper I began to trigger a cutscene in the Sanctum before I restarted. So two things:

1. Is it possible to get the memory in Hyrule Castle before? 

2. Can I explore any more of the castle beyond the paths in and the lower half without progressing the story? 

Thank you!
