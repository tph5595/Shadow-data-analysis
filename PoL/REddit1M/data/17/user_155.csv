64166,"I did this yesterday so it's pretty fresh. There are some bombable rocks that are hard to see in the - I want to say ""centre formation"" where the crabs are all having a party. It's above you too, so I had to throw a bomb from above.

It's still really hard to fly it, but what happened with me was... I took off, and I messed up, and landed on my feet, but I was still on the ""windpath."" I carried on anyway, for experience, thinking I blew it... and y'know, I think my feet planted 2/3 times doing this. But on the final one, I flew in and landed on the shrine thingy, and it accepted it as an attempt. Good times :)"
