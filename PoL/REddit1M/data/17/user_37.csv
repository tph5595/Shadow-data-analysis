6312,"I've defeated all four Divine Beasts. I've still got plenty of side quests to do, but for curiosities sake, are there any other main quests left besides Hyrule Castle? "
6579,Easiest path to the Hylian shield is to approach the castle from due north. You should see the remnants of an old bridge. Glide in from the north and slight to your right is a ramp you can land on. Run past the guardian into the door and you'll be in an area called Lockdown. At the end of the hallway on the right is a door with a bunch of bones in it. This will trigger a miniboss. Defeat the boss to get the shield. He's pretty easy if you have Stasis+. Feel free to clear the rest of lockdown area as there are some decent weapons to be found in the cells.
6649,The rock circles will always have a gap indicating a rock is missing. Find the missing rock nearby and place it in the gap.
6932,"Also, there is a sub-area on the way to Goron City. I think it's called Southern Mine or something like that. There is a non-Goron NPC who will give you a side quest, the reward for which is one of the pieces of the set you can buy in Goron City. Saves you from having to buy the entire set. "
