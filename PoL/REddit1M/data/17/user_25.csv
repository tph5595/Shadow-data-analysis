3881,"Are you happy with the Wii U library of games? Because that's all you're getting for that console. If you are, then go for it. 

As for the switch having problems, keep in mind that all hardware has a failure rate. When the Switch has reportedly sold 1.5 million units so far, even *15 thousand* people having problems is only a 1% failure rate. You're probably very unlikely to have a bad console out of the box."
4031,They ones in water? See if there's something you can throw into the circle.
4515,"Check inside the center rock area. From right in the middle, look around."
7139,"General weapons you find out and about, no.

Special weapons that you only get as part of quests can be rebuilt once broken."
7329,"From what I've seen, my guess is that you at least have to go find Naydra first. There will be a sort of automatic quest there. "
13778,"Unfortunately, no."
13808,I think you misunderstood the question.
16804,All upgrades are just extra armor. The only additional bonus you get is from wearing a complete set that has all been upgraded to 2-star or higher.
17830,"After defeating Ganon, you load to your most recent save. There is a star on your save and a completion percentage on your map screen. There is no post-Ganon gameplay."
18097,"You may lose loot to bombs, but only because the explosion sends them far away and you can't find them. Otherwise, the drop doesn't seem to be different.

On saving gemstones: If you need the money, selling gemstones is fine. They all have uses in the mid- and late-game as you upgrade armor, but at that point farming ores is pretty easy. You can also sell foraged food items (cook them in a pot first if you have the time to increase the price) and monster parts from common monsters like Bokoblins, since those are easy to collect again later if you need them."
18253,"I was able to find all of the memories without a guide and without using any of the painter tips after Kakariko. If you use context clues from the images, you should be able to figure out the general location pretty easily; any man-made landmarks (e.g. the horse statue) nearby usually appear on the map as well if you look closely. "
18343,Yeah. It's exactly the same as other Zelda games in that regard.
19961,"I'm talking about the map from the map screen. You can zoom in all the way and see details like trees and man-made constructions like ruins and statues. 

You see such a small portion of the map from that view that you have to get a general idea of where it's at first. I'll walk you through the Horse Statue as an example, in spoiler text so you can ignore it if you like:

[So you see the horse statute, and it's centered on a round stone. Around that is some grass, and then a path that wraps around it. Behind it, you see on the left some red, carved mountains; on the right you see a more typical lumpy mountain range. Those red mountains are the Gerudo mountains, and placing them on the left puts the Hebra mountains on the right. Those two mountains are on the left side of the map, so the horse is somewhere to the right of them. The castle is not in the image, so it's likely behind you - placing the horse statue somewhere west of the castle. So now you take the area between the triangle formed by the Hebra mountains, the Gerudo moutains, and the Castle, and examine that area for a round object with a path that wraps around it.](/spoiler)

For other images, you may have to look at things like the type of trees growing (different trees grow in different regions) or any large water features nearby, and then go to the area that makes sense and look around. There are a couple more memories that don't feature any such clues, but can be found by doing some of the other main quests or heavier sidequests."
20201,"The number on the icon is the defense value of the item. When you hover over it, you'll see two numbers on the right - one is your current total defense value, and the second is the defense value if you wear the item.

So if you currently have a 10 hat, 10 shirt, 10 pants, and get a 15 shirt, then the icon will have a 15 on it, and the box on the right will say ""30 -&gt; 35"""
20299,Throwing stuff is very accurate in this game. It goes exactly the direction you are pointed. 
20911,"No problem! Definitely try to find identifiable mountains in the backdrops, as those tend to be the most helpful in at least putting the memory in a smaller location to investigate."
21350,"There are a number of non-Shrine sidequests. Win all of the mini games/competitions. Find all of the armor and upgrade them. Other than that, most other things will be passively done by doing all of the shrines, I think."
21594,"A hearty lizard with a monster part will make something pretty close.

Edit: To clarify, I mean visibly as well as the use. There isn't a ""red potion"" in the game, but they've made the health elixirs look visually similar to red potions in other games, perhaps intentionally."
23506,There are a few shrines that can only be accessed by interacting with the dragons.
37360,Go to the Divine Beast on your map and teleport to it.
55212,Do you enjoy looking for them and feel satisfied when you find them?
56242,Don't run. Crouch and sneak up on them. The sheikah outfit helps but isn't necessary.
60297,"Kass has a non-shrine song quest. 

Edit: Just realized that this is The Hero's Cache. My mistake.

Are you sure you've done all of the shrine quests? Did you do the Warbler's Nest quest?"
60637,Did he say where he was going last time you talked to him? He probably went home to the Korok village. Do you have any ideas where that would be?
85969,"Strange. And you're certain that Kass isn't at Rito village? Where do you find him now, the Rito Stable?

Does his journal have the new entry in it at the end?"
105759,"Maybe you have to talk to him at each location to tell him you found the shrine/treasure? Like, the shrine quest gets completed when you find the shrine, but maybe you have to talk to him afterward as well. I'm assuming you've finished Van Medoh as well.

I have no idea really, just spitballing, it must be frustrating to have done all of the work and not get the payoff. "
106457,"I was under the impression that doing all of the quests related to his songs and the Warbler's Nest shrine quest would bring him home, but there could be something else that I don't know about (I have suspicions of similar hidden requirements regarding the dragons). 

If it's not a hidden requirement that we don't know about, then the only suggestion in-game I have is to double check his song locations to confirm that he's left them all; other than that, if it's a glitch then perhaps a hard shutdown of the console will fix it. 

If you figure it out, let me know. Sorry I can't be more help."
107223,"Haha! I'm really curious now what the final trigger was that made him appear, but I'm happy you got it to work. "
