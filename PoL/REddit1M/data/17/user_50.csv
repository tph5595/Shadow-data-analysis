11648,"I like to cook a single apple or a single piece of meat to sell for rupees. When combining items, you lose out e.g. 1 piece of meat sells for 20 but if I make a dish with 2 pieces of meat, it sells for 30, so I'm losing 10 rupees doing that. But when cooking one at a time, they get added to my inventory as separate items, so I can't select ""sell all"" when I'm selling. Is there any way to make them group together in one inventory slot?"

30074,"ahhhh gotcha. I may compromise the rupees, then, and just fry my meat by the fire. 12 bucks a pop."
