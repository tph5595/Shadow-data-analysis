81055,"A tip for the hearty food, like /u/iamapeopletoo said, just cook it on its own. If you try to add an effect bonus, you'll end up with a food that just heals 6 hearts, no bonus.

I think extra hearts is an effect all on its own, so trying to add an effect cancels it out.

Yes I learned this the hard way."
81100,Is there a fishing pole? Or am I stuck going swimming for fish? (I've heard bomb-fishing is a thing)
81413,"Also, it's indestructible (It ""breaks"", but it just goes on a cooldown). So, although other weapons are more powerful, you have to replace them after they break."
82105,"You can reflect the beams with a perfect block from any shield. If you miss the block, though, that beam will annihilate any mundane shield.

Once you get the timing down, it's not difficult. You can practice on ruined guardians like the ones on the staring plateau. (The ones most of us thought were Beamos at first)"
82537,"You can use a heavy bludgeoning weapon to break ore rocks, and they don't send the pieces flying. Iron hammers are easy to find; there's a couple around Goron village, and some of the stables have one laying around. They last a while if you only use it to break ore."
82667,This game has a lot of parallels to Monster Hunter. I wish they added a way to craft weapons from monster parts.
