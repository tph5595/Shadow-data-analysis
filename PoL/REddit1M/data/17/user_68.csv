17032,"I'd go full on Stamina now. Having more wheels makes combat so fun. I just spin around killing stuff. 

Oh and I'd hunt out truffles and radishes. With the food system, you can get a bunch of hearts. "
17172,Where? How much?
17458,"I'd be hesitant to sell anything, to be honest. At this point, I think the best thing to do is get stacks of 5 meats, cook them, and sell them. "
17655,"Without spoiling it, does it change the ending? I figured it would.

My son and I beat Ganon yesterday for fun. We are still playing to finish shrines and I guess memories. "
17732,Really on the lizard ability? I find it clutch against bigger baddies. 
17872,"Yea having wandered into the castle yesterday for the first time, I've now spent two days in the castle exploring and killing the Lynel- he's easy to kill FYI. Love the detail in the castle. 

Still haven't found that cook book though. "
18205,"Im killing the one in the guard tower. I don't think he is silver. There's one in a snow field next to a shrine that I really struggle with. I keep coming back and trying to beat him but he's tough. 

And I didn't find Ganon difficult at all. It was fun, but not difficult. "
35082,"Finished them off today. I'll have to try it out.

Do all shrines change the ending?"
35336,I missed a ton of Korok Seeds until my friends were listing their totals. I was confused how they'd found so many. Then I noticed how many I was missing. 
35711,I think the guardians respawn in the tests of strength whenever. My son likes to replay them.
