71023,"I keep seeing people talk about how Kilton will give you something and that stars will appear next to defeated boss monsters in the overworld. How do you do this?

I've bought and sold many many bits to him, he still only asks if I want to buy or sell. And if I'm not mistaken there's only four Moldugas right? I killed all four in one run doing a side quest but he still won't give me a thing. Have I done something wrong?"
72274,"That's my problem though, every time I talk to him it's JUST buying and selling. I don't have any other options. Is there a certain time or place I have to talk to him?"
72999,Isn't that the only time you can talk to him? That's the only time I ever see him
