2316,"What's the use for rock salt?

I'm trying to get rid of unnecesary inventory to earn some rupees.
I have completed every shrine and posibly every sidequest too and, iirc, I haven't used thse a single time, does anyone know if  I'll need a certain amount for any sidequest I might have missed?

edit: only for cooking aparently which I haven't done much during the game and I'll do even less at this point."
8112,"Yes, I know, it won't be useless but if it's only use it's optional (like cooking) I consider it unnecesary. I didn't sell at all during the game because of this precisely but I ask after going though all I'll need for armor upgrades (I checked the guide for that).

Also I need way more than 30 of each gem for every armor upgrade... luckily I think I'm done with the diamonds so I can sell the few I have now."
8770,"hehe So, ingame, cooking only? I haven't used that much during the game, I don't think I'll need it for what remains so.. if that's it's only use I'll sell it all. I will wait a little just in case someone knows if it's used somewhere else."

Even if not at any given time you can also restore your health by:

* Sleeping in Inn/stables
* Entering hot water in some rare locations
* Beating a shrine
* Getting a new heart container

And there's an statue somewhere in the game that buys you hearts/stamina and sells it back for 20 rupees more, I asume getting a heart container this way will also refill your health."
10920,"Raw meat and fruit did it for me, surely not as many hearts restored but I never had shortage, good thing there's not a limit of items Link can eat at once xD"
11788,"Yep, just sold it, there doesn't seem to be another use for it. Thanks!"
12034,"I ""hunt"" a lot and pick everything I find but also I scanned most of my amiibo 3 times (some only twice) and I have a ton of them xD that by itself probably game me enough food as not to care in the entire game but I still did (also because I didn't start with all of it, obvously)"
