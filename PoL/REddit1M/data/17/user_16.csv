2726,"I'm going to level with you; there are very, very few ""useless"" inventory items. Almost everything, monster parts, Boblokin horns, gems, etc., are used to upgrade various pieces of armor later on down the line. I sold a lot of shit early game that I wish I had held on to to upgrades stuff later. Even herbs are used in some armor upgrades. 

My recommendation would be to ""farm"" the Stone Talus mini bosses every blood moon to make gems. Once you have more than ~30 of each start selling them. You'll need more than that to fully upgrade some of the pieces, but that's a good start. Plus gems sell for a healthy amount. "
3995,I'm so excited to go back to that guy now that I have a third stamina bar and [the flying ability you get from the bird tower] (/spoiler). That dude is going to think I can literally fly. 
4029,What is their weak point? I haven't dared flying close enough to test out said relevant arrows yet. 
4154,I went balls to the wall on stamina right after I got 13 heart containers. Now that I have 3 stamina wheels I'm going back to hearts. 
4380,You should find him while walking up to Goron City from the south. 
4504,"&gt; and on a reliable system

Well, hold your horses there. The Switch is plenty reliable, so let's not go down that road. 

That being said, if you are a Zelda fan, I cannot think of a reason for you to not own a Wii U. Twilight Princess HD, Windwaker HD, and Breath of the Wild are all immediately available. Through the virtual console you can own a lot of the older games as well. My Wii U is basically a Smash/Zelda machine, and I love it that way. Plus I've heard that BotW runs fine on Wii U, so you wouldn't be losing out on anything playing it there (other than a few more pixels, depends on how much you care about that sort of thing). "
4609,"&gt;Are yo happy with the Wii U *and the Wii* library of games?

Fixed that for you. As someone who didn't own a Wii originally, being able to play Skyward Sword for the first time was a huge selling point since the Wii U is backwards compatible. I know I'm one of only like three people who didn't have a Wii in their household, but if you missed any Wii games and want to play them again or for the first time, the Wii U library is actually quite dense. "
4679,"Usually if you go uphill from them you'll find a large rock or a large snowball that needs to be rolled down into the ""target"". This will make the Korok pop up. "
4734,"Could you tell me how the flight range contest goes? What's the time limit, are you allowed to land back on the platform, doe your stamina replenish whenever you start gliding again like when you go to the beast, etc. ?"
4822,"Traveling AND fighting guardians. It's just a useful ability all around. 

The Gerudo Beast ability is mostly only useful for taking down Stone Talus in my experience (that's the only time I am able to utilize to it's full potential). The Zora beast is generally useful all the time when it's off of cool down. I haven't done the lizard yet but I'm excited. "
4869,"I know it's not what you meant, but I just pictured you deleting that save file because it must be cursed and starting completely over. "
4902,I usually roll with ~20 so that I can take out guardians for parts to upgrade that ancient armor. 
5510,Wait...can you not do the range just for funsies after you do it that one time? I figured it would be a contest range of sorts. 
5606,"And since the shock part of it always stuns them, allowing you to wind up again. 

Mini-bosses are really the only time that I can get the whirly bird going for 2-3 hits and land the Gerudo one though. In a crowd of normal enemies it's somewhat hit or miss, as there is usually enough going on that I'll inevitably get hit by a stray arrow from a half a mile away before I can go whirl winding into the crowd. "
5859,"Check to the South-Eastish around Lake Floria in the waterfalls. Farosh is a wiley bastard and appears in like 3 different locations, but I've had the best luck in those waterfalls. "
5906,I think the guy who's stalking the Inn Keeper in Hateno is pretty freaking weird. 
5946,Talk to the Queen's bodyguard lady. I think she's the one who does it. 
6342,"You use it to upgrade various armors later. You'll need red/white jelly for some upgrades, which you can make by freezing/burning regular jelly. "
6415,Get the remainder of the memories if you haven't done that. Both because they are amazing and because they tell you the story of 100 years ago. 
8510,"Yes, once you break that one you can give the Queen's guard lady a diamond and some other materials and she'll make you a new one. Same goes with the weapons given to you by the other leaders following their divine beast quests; each town has it's own person who can make a new one. "
8847,"Cooking is by no means optional, as that is the only way to get health back in the game outside of fairies and one special ability. Unless you mean fancy cooking outside of mixing a hearty food with meat or a conditional effect with meat. But cooking, generally, is pretty necessary. "
9094,Are you using the zoom on the camera? Is it just popping up as ??? or is it not registering it at all?
9443,"Have you tried picking the item up and then dropping it somewhere with better visibility? Like in a street or something. I'm just spitballing here, I haven't had this issue before. "
10238,Walk around behind the counter and talk to her. Taking to her from across the counter engages her in Inn Keeper mode. Going around the counter and talking to her face to face engages her as an individual. 
10306,"I'm not sure about using them in combat. As to making them, have you tried dropping a pile of jelly and shooting an electric arrow at the pile? That's how I make the other types but with fire/ice arrows instead. "
11673,Just go out to Hyrule Castle. The area right outside is literally crawling with guardians begging to be one-shot. I walked in there with 20 ancient arrows. Walked out with 9 ancient cores and enough components for a whole lot more arrows.
12204,"Dark Souls taught me that I'm not a good at parrying, so I honestly haven't even tried in this game. "
12286,"It depends on your purpose in cooking. If you are cooing for health, mix and match different types of things (not just five meat, but like 2 herbs and a meat, etc.) to get increased effects. If you are cooking for rupees, cook rare ingredients with salt and herbs and stuff that's normally super cheap to beef the value up. "
12380,"You should definitely buy as many as you currently can and then stock back up on them after a run. I've been trying to snowball my arrows into more arrows by killing guardians and I'm up to 40 now. That way I can feel comfortable farming to get Ancient Gear and upgrading said gear. 

(I gotta farm guardians so I can upgrade this gear that makes fighting guardians easier. Makes sense, yea? XD)"
14149,I think so too. I'm really tired. Been staying up way too late playing this game. 
18172,"The stable guy is definitely the easiest solution. That or knowing the general landmarks by sight and backtracking them. 

If you're asking if there are map markers, since that's the only thing easier than a guy telling you exactly where to go, then answer is unfortunately no. "
18267,"Save your jewels, as the jewelry can be extremely useful. Since I saved my jewels, it was my first piece of completely upgraded ""armor"" which gave me ~+28 for my head slot AND an elemental resistance. 

Alternatively, you could just start farming the hell out of Stone Talus...Taluses...Tali? Stone Tali. Mark them on your map and kill them every blood moon, and don't save more than ~30-40 of each gem until you get a bit later in the game. "
18331,Anyone know a good way to get star fragments? The ones I see fall from the sky seem to despawn before I can get to them half way up a mountain several hundred meters away. 
49253,Is it midnight? I think that's when the Stalnox awaken. And I think you have to reload the area. 
49313,Not that I've seen.  Annoying little dude popped up when I was fighting two guardians today.  Shot me out of the air and nearly got me killed
49351,Fredrick
49434,And 50 arrows at a time is no joke
