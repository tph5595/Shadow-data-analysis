19883,"/u/FantasyForFiction I can also confirm the reliability.  Switch pretty stable, but obviously still limited at this point, as support is coming.  Only issue I have had was the BOTW making of video freezing once.  The in game resume has been absolutely flawless.  It is akin to what my xboxone was like prior to the move from trios to w10 with a first party title.  (super stable on resume from sleep).

I have the Red/Blue version, if it makes any difference in the models off the line...

20063,"Not to mention TP, if you haven't played that.  I must admit having skipped Wii U, I do hope big N does release some of the games on Switch, not to mention having them on the go.  Also hoping for emulation.  Wouldn't normally care, but my daughter will be getting old enough to game and I think BOTW is a bit much for her, although I mentioned in a prior thread, she dose enjoy charging weapons then releasing and jumping.  Still isn't great about the control stick.  "
