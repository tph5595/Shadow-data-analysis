I couldn't finish this game for so long because I couldn't play the last tune right, to unlock the final tracks. 

Had a similar problem with Phantom Hourglass. For some reason in the final boss fight, it would never recognise the Hourglass I had drawn. 

Got it eventually though. Liked both games, to be frank. They aren't the best Zelda games out there, but definitely fun to play. "
