Edit: To clear things up: I more meant lame from the hero's perspective. He was chosen, and all he managed to do was lock Ganondorf away for some kid to clean up his mess in the future."

Don't get me wrong, I love Windwaker, it's definitely one of my favorites in the series. It just seems silly after Skyward Sword imposed the reincarnation canon."
24540,I understand that. It was definitely my least favorite of the 3D Zeldas. I did like the characters (except Fi) and the story was ok. I really just didn't have fun playing a lot of it.
