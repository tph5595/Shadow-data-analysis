13756,"I mean, Link in WW wasn't really the chosen hero. He took it up out of necessity. Several of the ancient characters talk about him not being the true hero. Even then, the game is fantastic. "
19831,"Quite honestly, i think it's pretty cool. Basically everyone else is content ignoring the growing threat. Some 11 year old kid or so decides he is going to save his kidnapped sister. He then figures he wants to get a bit of payback and steals the sword of the chosen hero, forces the power back inside of it, finds pieces of a magical golden triangle scattered across the entire ocean, and delivers one of the two most satisfactory killing blows in any zelda game. He does all of this while being written off by nearly the entirety of the population who seem to view him as a kid playing pretend instead of a different kind of hero. It's kind of badass. "
39154,I also enjoyed the one in Twilight Princess. It was pretty satisfying. 
39886,"Ah. I was led to believe it was more of he took the mantle upon himself, due to the in game text and all the older characters not recognizing him as being the hero at all, including the KoRL who i thought states it a few times. Then again, i havent read the official canon and im also a bit buzzed. However, ive heard the Hyrule Historia is a bit arbitrary so can official canon now be my post a bit further down? Just this once? I may be biased, but i believe its a bit more exciting how i described it."
