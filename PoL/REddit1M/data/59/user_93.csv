64216,Dying Light was a zombie apocalypse in the Middle East and it was more colorful than this. Lots of water doesn't mean brown skies.

Honestly, however much of an unpopular ***opinion*** this is, if there was one more Wind Waker game, I would've vomited. Let alone a vehicle game in general. "

Nothing was steam anyway, it just had some things with that aesthetic. It was just the right level of steampunk, maybe a bit more would've been okay. "
