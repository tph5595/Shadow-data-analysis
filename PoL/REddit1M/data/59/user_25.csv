14628,"Well, first off, it's not like Link is just ""some guy"". He is the hero chosen to protect Zelda, essentially. He's sorta like the Avatar of the Zelda universe. 

But besides that, just speaking from a realistic standpoint, Link is far more iconic than Zelda. Granted, the series is called the Legend of Zelda, yet Link is the only character who is consistently a major character in every game. Zelda, on the other hand, is not. Hell, in Majora's Mask, Zelda only appears in one scene, and that's a flashback. "
