27878,"I know this has nothing to do with the steampunk setting, but I came up with an idea for a pre-flood Zelda game a long time ago.

I loved Majora's Mask and how you essentially had a ""party"" of 4 different characters with differing abilities. I wished that each character wasn't just Link transforming, and that they could have fun and travel together and play concerts or some shit.

So my idea was that Ganondorf has come back, and the Hyruleans are getting their asses handed to them. People are expecting the Hero of Time to come back, but he hasn't shown up yet. Instead, multiple characters of the different races have popped up claiming to be the new Hero of Time or something.  Maybe one of the characters is pressured by his race to live up to the mantle of the Hero of Time. Maybe one of the characters is not a Hero of Time claimant but just wants to save Hyrule. Eventually the Hero of Time claimants would realize that they can't really use the Master Sword, and nobody can use the Triforce of Courage, and thus are up shit creek BUT they still have hope; the King of Hyrule has a plan to flood Hyrule and destroy Ganondorf's army, so the multiple ""Heroes of Time"" are then tasked to stall Ganon long enough for all of Hyrule to evacuate.

There would definitely be a Goron Hero and a Zora Hero, maybe a Deku Hero or a Kokiri Hero, and then something completely different like a Gerudo Heroine or a Sheikah Hero with different abilities far expanded from Majora's Mask. The entire game is the 4 of them traveling together through dungeons, switching to make use of their unique abilities. I couldn't figure out what combat would be like, maybe they'd all run around in formation like in Four Swords or maybe the other 3 characters you weren't using would have AI.

I didn't think about a multiplayer mode because dungeons made for a single player switching between characters in mind would be complete cake for a group of 4 people playing in tandem, and it would probably be boring because I'd expect half of the puzzles to be ""Make Goron dude weigh this switch down, then have him wait around doing nothing because there are no enemies."""
