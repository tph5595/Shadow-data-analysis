37292,"The Story of the Flood will happen in some form, eventually.  There was, in fact, a Hero there.

Two curses:

**Hylia's Curse**: ""Whenever Hyrule is in danger, [the Hero and Goddess] will be reborn.""

**Demise's Curse**: ""Those who share the Spirit of the Hero and the Blood of the Goddess, my hate will forever follow your kind.""

*When Hyrule is in danger, Link and Zelda will appear.  When Link and Zelda appear, Demise's incarnation will put Hyrule in danger.*

Ganon being freed from his seal in the Flood Era fulfills the criteria for Hylia's Curse (we know this because other games have proven that a Demise Incarnation being unsealed counts as an incarnation).  Hylia's Curse is universal law, just as Demise's Curse is.  It **must be fulfilled**.

""But the backstory said there was no hero!""

He failed.  His last action was to seal Ganon's power in the Master Sword (recall that only Link can wield it, and *somebody* did that), but he couldn't truly defeat him.

King Daphnes was either unaware of the Hero, or did not believe he was the Hero.  Also recall that King Daphnes only knows of the existence of the Hero of Time.  He does not know there is an entire lineage of reincarnated Heroes.  If King Daphnes was shown a boy who was claimed to be the Hero, but could not claim memories of being the Hero of Time, it's not unlikely that he would deny him as a Hero.  This is also why the King calls the Hero of Winds ""unrelated to the Hero"", even though the Hero of Winds possesses the Spirit of the Hero.  The King only cares about the Hero of Time because that is all he knows from the legends he grew up with in his era.

As for the Hero of the Flood being lost to history, this is simple human nature.  The people of the Great Sea don't even remember that Hyrule is real - do you think their entire story is trustworthy?  Especially if it turns out that the Hero of the Flood was entirely unknown to the general public, as so many Heroes have been before?

The Flood is the one great empty plot point on the timeline right now and we will certainly see a game set during it, in which we succeed in sealing Ganon and his power but ultimately fail to stop the Flood.  Tragedy is an excellent storytelling mechanism and there's no reason for Nintendo to shy away from it."
