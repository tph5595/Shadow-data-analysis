15780,"I think this would be extremely hard for this idea to work. Don't get me wrong, I love the idea of learning more about the flood. I want to see a Hyrule that is so desperately in need of salvation that the Goddesses' best option was to destroy it. 

That being said, I think Nintendo's problem is getting around us knowing what it's about. The game either has to have a Hero that fails/dies and history forgets him(I believe in Wind Waker it mentions there being no Hero during this time, but maybe it's just a failed on that is forgotten over the years?) or it has to have someone who believes they are and tries to be the Hero with the same result. 

If gamers go into the game knowing that, I think the game will feel a bit closed off and won't truly feel or play like a LoZ game. So they would have to hide it from us until a good portion of the way through the game. They'd have to make us feel like we're going to be the Hero and save Hyrule yet again, and then near the end of the game they would crush all our hopes and dreams. Then the final portion, the ""endgame,"" would be to bring about the flood and destroy everything. 

Sounds like a great story, but I don't see it working as a game in the series we know and love. "
