Sure it's not best one out there but it has it's charms like the train, it was fun, just like the boat King of Red Lions, only in a fixed path and you unlock different tracks as well. The music is good. The temples and bosses were interesting. The only real problem I have with Spirit Tracks is the pan flute."
