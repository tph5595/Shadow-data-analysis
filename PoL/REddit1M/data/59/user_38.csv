20459,I definitely wish that. I was looking forward to this and then what do we get instead? Freakin Skyward Sword. 
20578,What? It looks like an industrial era. What about that is angsty? 
20751,"You think The Hero of the Wind being such a badass that he restores the master sword and takes of the mantle of the Chosen Hero, all of his own choice, is lame? Really? It was better than doing it ""because it's your destiny."" "
20903,So I take it you haven't heard the recent news about Netflix. 
22928,"They knew Ganondorf was going to eventually break free. They knew it would end up being a problem. There's nothing lame about the Hero of Time in this scenario. He did what he was supposed to do. You can't ask for more than that. 

If you mean it's lame due to a lack of prestige, then who gives a fuck. Fuck being ""The Chosen One."" The fact that Nintendo pushed that whole shtick so much with Skyward Sword did nothing more than limit what they can do with future games. "
24179,And for that I consider Skyward Sword to be the silly one. 
29846,That doesn't answer my question. How is it angsty?
