22221,No I don't think so. I'm thinking the whole game is set in a super built up version of Hyrule with a similar time thing as in Majoras Mask (But with more of an emphasis on doing things fast rather than rewinding time a lot). As time goes on lower levels of the city are gradually lost to the rising water (though you can occasionally make rescue missions to dive under and restomp previous areas).
