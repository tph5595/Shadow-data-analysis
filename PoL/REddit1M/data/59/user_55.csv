He's captured Zelda (what else is new), but also captured Link in his rescue attempt. You're just a commoner, no connection with the chosen hero at all, but probably some kid that Link was kind to at a young age, and you have to set them free."
35732,"No, I'm not crazy. And isn't that why the idea is so compelling? Link is pretty much given all of his abilities and his weapons. What if some kid *earned* them. 

It would be a different game. This character would have to really struggle in a way that Link never has. There would be no navi or fi guiding him. He's just a boy in a way that we've never seen Link. He's just a boy who wants to save the world. "
35767,No. What's the deal with that game?
38950,It's on Playstation?  I'll have to check it out.  Thanks!!
41192,"No. I can see how perhaps I didn't write down my idea clear enough. 

You're correct in that Wind Waker link is not the chosen hero. But, he has the exact same path as every other link has had. Everyone's like ""He's not the chosen hero, but whatever he's good enough."" 

To be clear, what I'm talking about is a story in which the chosen hero, Link, fails. And some commoner who's not endorsed by the gods, who's not sought out by any King of Red Lions, forges his or her own path to save the world in the absence of a chosen hero. 

And this game should be really hard, because nobody is trying to help this kid. "
44146,Yes. YES. That would be awesome. Playing as Zelda/Sheik. The big victory is simply getting Hyrule to last the 7 years. Awesome.
