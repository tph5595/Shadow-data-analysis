""More frustrating"" does not mean ""harder"". The Water Temple isn't that hard as far as Zelda dungeons go, Great Bay temple was harder, Eagle's Tower was harder, as well as just about every dungeon in Link to the Past , yet nobody complains about those. The problem with the Water Temple is that it was built around gameplay mechanics that were needlessly complicated, and completely destroyed the flow of progress. Also, how was I supposed to know about that secret passage under the slab, there was nothing else like it anywhere else.     "

I was not very good at A Link to the Past. "

But hey, different strokes for different folks, I mean, I thought the puzzles and the dungeons in Skyward Sword were an improvement from Ocarina of Time in terms of difficulty and creativity, I especially loved The Ancient Cistern.   

It's interesting that you use the word ""coasting"" given that it means ""Move easily without using power"" considering that we were just talking about how the Water Temple making mere movement more difficult and complicated than it needed to be.  "

Now I feel all special for beating it as a kid without a walkthrough. "
