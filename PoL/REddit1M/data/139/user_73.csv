Ocarina of Time. Rated E for everyone!"

Imagine being jailed with the threat of a torture device looming out of the shadows from outside the bars. The way to escape is clear as day. Just an open door... You try to walk out but then suddenly your legs are broken from the fall and several zombies slowly walk towards you, screaming. EUGH, the well is scary :(

IIRC, there's even a false floor right beneath the torture device. Imagine you've been strung up on it and left to bleed out by your hylian captors... You actually manage to loosen the bonds and slip free of the ropes! But then you keep falling... Just brutal!"
