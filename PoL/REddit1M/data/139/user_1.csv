1785,"""In 2009, Nintendo apologized for the difficulty of the Water Temple.""

You have GOT to be kidding me. I didn't think Nintendo properly displayed that they were completely ball-less until they released Skyward Sword (which took zero risks and was very linear, to allow for the commongamer to be happy with it)... but now I know that it was in 2009.

You know why the Water Temple got so much flack? Because kids couldn't remember that videogames are *interactive* stories. You can't expect to pick up a game like it's a book and go from beginning to end without any snags whatsoever. ""These water levels are so confusing! The Keys are too well hidden!"" Really though? All it takes is a slightly different style of thinking to complete the dungeon relative to the others - which was a *good* thing, to keep everything unique. It was about inputting your own intuition and seeing if it led to victory or defeat.

I dare Nintendo to make a Zelda game in which every single dungeon is ""harder"" than the OoT Water Temple. Why? I don't know about you guys, but I remember very vividly my first time playing OoT. The most satisfying victory of mine was against Morpha, because it meant *I bested the Water Temple.* The most satisfying victories are the ones that are harder to achieve. 

Nintendo, please. *More Water Temples.*"
42459,"Nowhere in my comment did I assert that the Water Temple was hard rather than frustrating. When I said, ""I dare Nintendo to make a Zelda game in which every single dungeon is ""harder"" than the OoT Water Temple."" - I was challenging Nintendo to make more dungeons that are not walks in the park. I want to be stumped on temples, whether it's through sheer difficulty or non-linear, intuitive puzzles.

I agree that the Water Temple was formed around cumbersome game mechanics, but I'll be honest - *it didn't matter.* Why? Because those mechanics contributed to the feeling of awesomeness when you made it through the temple. Maybe those feelings were not caused from the right things, but it sure beats just *coasting* through a temple, ala SS."
42993,"A new art style isn't really a risk, I'm afraid to say. Pretty much every Zelda game has its own unique look, minus OoT and MM.

I agree that the combat was a nice change, but I speak for many people when I say I expected to see that type of swordplay in TP. It was fair to expect to be swinging the Master Sword with the normal Wiimote. I wouldn't even say it was a ""risk"" because it was such a widely accepted expectation. The Wiimote pretty much *is* a sword, so it was a very logical step for the game to have such a combat system.

Puzzles are all good, but lots of games have puzzles. Calling them innovative isn't really right either, since any puzzle that's *not* innovative is simply a copy of something else, and gets flack for it.

Think of a sequel like MM. It was a COMPLETELY different game than OoT, even though it was a direct sequel made with the same engine. You can't tell me with a straight face that Nintendo genuinely expected the same audience to love MM that loved OoT. They were just *so different.* And that's what made them so great. Non-gamers might look at them and say ""That's the same game, what gives?"" But they couldn't be more wrong. The kinds of changes in style and plot between those two games... That's risk."
50517,"At least Nintendo learned from that mistake - WW and TP had some glorious iron boot hot-keyed redemption.

But to my point, think of it this way - Imagine completing the water temple as a kid, after putting on and taking off the boots a million times. It feels great to think ""Wow, I'm SO glad I'm through with that boot swapping bullshit.""

Like I said before, those feelings of satisfaction may or may not have been caused by good things, and the iron boot swapping was by no means a good thing. But the feeling of satisfaction you get when completing the temple, knowing that you don't need to use them anymore, is a very real one. Again, maybe not for a good reason, but it's still there."
