14974,TIL OoT is actually a very violent game considering the amount of death/horrors that goes on both before and during the game
103306,"Quick question on the matter though.  The kokiri can take on whatever form and since they are forest spirits they don't age (as the game states).  Technically, couldn't saria or the kokiri for that matter change their form into adults since in WW they changed their form as well?"
