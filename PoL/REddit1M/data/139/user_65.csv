31951,"It is also the first Zelda game in which I've died since Majora's Mask (fucking Gyorg). I *guess* it can be easy if you grind for potions, but I usually ran out of ingredients quickly. Ghirahim, Koloktos, Demise, and Imprisoned II regularly kill me if I don't really concentrate and Moldarach kills me more often than not. Skyward is by far the hardest 3D Zelda game, which for me makes it much more memorable than, say, Twilight Princess where I didn't die once in my entire playthrough. "

IMHO SS has the best combat just because it is much much more versatile. Coupled with the fact that Link acquires very useful items (Both Slingshot and Bow are useful, the whip and fan distract and open up enemies, stuff like that), its the first Zelda ever that I feel the items are worth to you more than just ""Use it in this dungeon or this fight"", like TP's many useless items (the top, ball and chain, lightrod, etc) or Windwaker's statue controlling song. The 2D games are loaded with this, especially with the Oracles games."

I've played this game with younger cousins and they had the same trouble beating water cistern as I did when playing Forest temple at their age. Of course, they had me to beat the living crap out of the the four-armed stalfos (the only *ever* miniboss to ever kill me in any Zelda). The more Zelda you play the more obvious everything becomes.
