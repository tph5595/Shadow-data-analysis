52840,"Knowing that you have clean water and enough food to eat after going months without it is a relief too. Nintendo makes a lot of great Zelda dungeons and puzzles that are get satisfying to complete based on how they bend your brain. This one broke the mold with its level design in a radical enough way that the solution wasn't satisfying, it was dissatisfying because when you figure it out you feel like you've been tricked by being led to assume that dungeons work one way and this one had an important exception it never led you to guess. The fact that it was so frustrating that leaving behind was a relief does nothing to support its merits as a dungeon. 

I don't think it was awful, but it was flawed. "
