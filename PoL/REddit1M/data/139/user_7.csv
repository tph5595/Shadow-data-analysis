It's not all about difficulty, but how accessible the game is and how easy/fun it is to play in cases like this. (Easy as in you don't need to do a ton of mundane tasks to do something simple, like putting on/off boots a trillion times every other second, not easy as in how easy it is to beat the dungeon in a skill sense)"
