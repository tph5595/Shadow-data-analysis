13032,"When I read the section about the dead hand I got chills. Perhaps there were legends of it in the war. But everyone thought it a myth. Until some soldiers became prisoners of war and wouldn't talk. Their judgment was to become a sacrifice to the dead hand. Imagine being thrown into a dark room filled with more skulls than you ever want to see in one place. Then you hear a faint sound. A pair of dim pale yellow eyes shows in the darkness. They slowly grow taller and taller until they reach their maximum height. And into the light steps the most terrifying creature you have ever laid eyes on. The Dead Hand. You try to escape but you are too late. Hands come out of the ground and seize hold of your limbs with blinding speed. You try desperatley to escape, yet the hands that lay a hold of you have a grip like that of iron. All the while, the creature slowly inches toward you and you are powerless. It stops inches before your face to examine you. The smell of rotting flesh on its breathe enters your nostrils. Outside of the cell are screams that echo across the halls of others who are meeting their fate in other chambers. The war has produced the ugliest in men ever in Hyrules history. A history written in blood."
