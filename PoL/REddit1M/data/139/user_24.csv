Pre-v1.2 OoTs also featured a [stock Islamic chant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4) as Fire Temple BGM, which also appeared in [Cairo Cruis'n](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IVZCA1akyD4) of Cruis'n World, the [Love-Hate Chant](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WU1SLwUDDw) of Kakuto Chojin, and the [Neo-Ark Theme #2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDkXiR8AZsI) of Parasite Eve II. It quotes from [Surat Al-Fātiĥah verse 1](http://quran.com/1) of Islam's [Qur'an](http://quran.com), which reads ""بسم الله الرحمن الرحيم."" The Yusuf Ali translation of the [Qur'an](http://quran.com) translates this, ""In the name of Allah, Most Gracious, Most Merciful."" It faintly fades in around [0:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=42) and occurs 6 times in a 6-4-8 repetition structure. You hear it from [0:42](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=42) to [0:56](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=56), [1:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=62) to [1:12](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=72), [1:22](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=82) to [1:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=100), [2:21](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=141) to [2:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=154), [2:40](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=160) to [2:48](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=168), and [3:00](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=180) to [3:18](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=198), though the only words that are audible are ""الله"" (""Allah""), ""الرحمن"" (""Rahman,"" or ""Gracious""), and ""رحيم"" (""Rahim,"" or ""Merciful""). Throughout the tune you also have the تَكْبِير, known as the [Takbīr](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Takbir), for which the Arabic is ""الله أكبر,"" meaning ""Allāhu Akbar."" By paraphrase this translates to ""God is Great,"" and by metaphrase, ""God is Greater."" It occurs four times at [1:29](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=89), [1:36](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=96), [3:06](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=186), and [3:14](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=194). Usually this is recited when beginning, and often during, a Muslim prayer. You also have Rahman and Rahim overlapping the standard chants at [1:25](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=85), [1:34](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=94), [3:02](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=182), and [3:10](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5blHw6C4Ax4&amp;t=190).

From comments made by Greg Hamilton of NoA I conclude that the [OoT sound team](http://gaming.wikia.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time/credits) (Koji Kondo, Yoji Inagaki, and Takuya Maekawa) were at first unaware that the chanting in the stock sound was Islamic. Apparently they removed it when they found this out, suggesting the reluctance of Nintendo to directly involve religion in OoT.

The Water Temple isn't hard. You wanna know what's hard?

**The Great Palace of Zelda II.**

The Great Palace is no ordinary dungeon. The Great Palace is harder than a diamond-encrusted dildo, and it'll fuck you twice as fast with three times the vigor.

The Great Palace was made with one solitary purpose. That purpose is to *wreck your shit.* It does not go easy on you. It does not treat you with fragility. It comes at you like the motherfucking Terminator on a homing missile manufactured by Screw You Incorporated, and it *fucks you up.*

The Great Palace is longer than Scripture, hotter than Hell, cheaper than dirt, and worse than Hitler. The Great Palace is a holocaust of Links. The Great Palace has so many rooms, it provokes the collective jealousy of Las Vegas hotels. The Great Palace makes the Cretan labyrinth look like a straight corridor bottomed by a goddamn conveyor belt. The Great Palace is a twisted, tortured rape machine of lava pits that take no prisoners.

To get to the Great Palace you [climb up a cross](http://www.zeldawiki.org/images/8/80/Great_Palace.png) because *it motherfucking crucifies you.* The Great Palace does not fuck around. It does not dilly-dally, and it does not lollygag. It crashes into your ego with the force of a thousand Terminian moons. The difficulty curve is a straight vertical line and atop that line are all of its monsters, their asses agape as they repeatedly *shit on you.* The Great Palace goes green, and what it recycles is Link. Buddhists will envy your reincarnations and cats will envy your lives as the Great Palace swallows you down its throat, pisses you out its dick, and repeats this sick process in a nihilistic Gryllsian cycle of go fuck yourself.

When Link gets to the Great Palace, he should arm himself with his LoZ whistle so he can blow it when *his shit gets raped.* The Great Palace literally has monsters whose species names sound like [Fuck You](http://www.zeldawiki.org/Fokkeru), [Fucker](http://www.zeldawiki.org/Fokka). You get attacked by Fuck You, Fucker. You remember the Iron Knuckles from OoT? The guys that were among the hardest enemies of the game, and who shoved their iron knuckles right up your ass? Well, they're everywhere in AoL, too, and *Fucker makes them look like the bad punchline of a shitty joke.* If that's not bad enough, Fuck You is a bipedal birdman that leaps at your pitiful form and *retches fireballs at your head.* Are his fireballs magic? Are his fireballs science? Who the tits knows and who the twat cares? They're made of *Fuck Your Shit Up.*

Is that how you saw your morning going? You'd take a nice stroll down Death Lane and *some freaky fucking circus chimeras would spring out of the goddamn woodwork to puke two thousand degrees of face-frying heat on your head?* Fuck no it wasn't. Who the bitch wants their morning to go like that? I sure as hell don't, and I'll bet my ass and a bottle of potion that you sure as hell don't either.

When you arrive at the Great Palace, you know what you do? You stop right the fuck there, you drop what you're fucking doing, you shift your gears to reverse, and you moonwalk your bitch ass back home. Then, if you're lucky enough to still have your arms, you clasp your two hands together and you pray to Din, Farore, and Nayru that a wayward Fucker doesn't follow you out and add you to his big list of shit he wants to fuck up today.

54446,"The main problem with Reddit is that it's full of too many people like you. Instead of being entertaining, informative, or contributory, you whine and complain about quality content and you bash those who create it while not contributing much of value yourself.
 
Apparently the reigning King of Humor (who until now I didn't even know existed - fancy that!) died and passed his holy humor crown to you, so I went into your comment history to discover for myself this masterful and Elysian standard of funny I'm so apparently missing. Man, my jaw sure was agape when I discovered that not only are you largely humorless (e.g. posting such community-building and informative content like telling someone you ""hate [them] for being a self-righteous fuck"") and bitter (e.g. resentful whining about losing a card game, going on to blather, ""What bugs me is those assholes that will condescendingly critique your deck after winning a match""), but that when you *do* try to make jokes, you're about as funny as a cancer-laden Holocaust survivor at a rape clinic.

Let's examine from your posting history some of what you seem to think is ""funny:""

&gt; And I'd bet money that my board is always cleaner and easier to read than yours you no good son'a'bitch!

Oh man, what a riot! It's funny because you said ""no good son'a'bitch."" Nobody in the history of the world has ever said this before! This is surely a gold standard of creativity and a wellspring of originality to which all comedians aspire; imagine how hilarious I would be were I capable of wit so inventive!

&gt; Seeing as you type like a 14 year old girl I'm going to go out on a limb and say you probably don't have enough experience with anything to be offering advice to anyone.

Well slap my tits and call me Sally, I never should've doubted you! It's funny because you said someone types like a 14 year old girl; because your holy sperging judgments from on high of how people type are so necessary in this world, and clearly indicate their intelligence and not your inferiority complex.

&gt; *Ain't nobody got enough removal for that.*

By Merlin's balls! You beat the dead horse corpse of an overspent meme that's been dead for around half a year. I laughed so hard, ""Ferret_Lord"" (my, what a wacky username!), that I took a tumble off my pterodactyl. If only I could one day be as witty as you... then I could [call professional historians ""fucking idiots""](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/zrb8x/us_ambassador_and_3_staff_members_killed_in_an/c673u0p?context=3) and accuse them of being [garbage](http://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/zrb8x/us_ambassador_and_3_staff_members_killed_in_an/c673ua0?context=3) for not supporting a warped, xenophobic, racist view of history. It's funny that you call him a ""historian,"" too, as if to call his expertise into question without advancing any counterpoints of your own. Perhaps one day I will be as hilarious as you, wandering the lands of the Internet as I shit on well-constructed posts to justify my sense of self-worth. :)

After reading some of your post history and getting a sense of what you find funny, I'm flattered you so vehemently hate my humor. The Golden Goddesses help me if I didn't, as then I'd be on the same humor wavelength as *you.*

Now let's address some of your silly claims. I ""never actually managed to say *anything*,"" have only repeated that ""it's hard six dozen times,"" haven't ""back[ed] it up with something,"" and haven't ""followed [it] up with actual *content*""? Wrong. I said it's no ordinary dungeon, for it is the final dungeon. Content. I said it's long, and it's arguably one of the longest dungeons in the series. Content. I said it has ""so many rooms."" Content. I say it's very labyrinthine. Content. I say the difficulty curve drastically increases at that point in the game. Content. I compare the Fokka to the Iron Knuckle (both of which are similar enemies) to establish his difficulty. Content. I describe enemy attack patterns. Content. Where's your content? You just lie about a lack of content, are dead wrong in those lies, and repeat those lies several times in different paraphrases that hypocritically masquerade as content. My, my, [projecting](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_projection) aren't we? Between the two of us, I think a brief glance at our posting histories shows who follows things up with more content. :)

Moreover, while my funny was an offshoot of my content, obviously the main point was the funny, not the content. What you're doing is like criticizing a mostly historically accurate painting for its historical accuracy; not only isn't that the point of the painting at all, but it's also mostly historically accurate, so not only are you irrelevant but you're also dead wrong. If you want to have a content-off sometime on why the Great Palace is difficult, when I have the time I'd be more than happy to out-analyze you with my apparent inability to say anything. :)

&gt; It's like you [...] never had the attention span to make it further than 2 sentences in.

A post in my comment history that's nearly 10,000 words in length says otherwise. And where, ""Ferret_Lord,"" are your contributions? :)

&gt; It's like you learned to write from cracked articles.

Cracked articles are pretty funny! I couldn't read the start of what you wrote because in the way of my computer monitor was a stack of my publications in high-tier academic journals. :)

Keep needlessly bashing funny and informative things on Reddit! You're truly doing the world a service and making a real difference, and I'm sure Mrs. Ferret_Lord (may the Golden Goddesses bless her tail, in compensation for having not blessed her parenting) is super proud of you."
69961,So says the troll; I can't imagine living in a bandwagon under a bridge is too sanitary. ;)
71557,"The Victorian era called; they want their high horse back.

Profanity undirected at anyone in particular can be a wonderful way to accentuate a point. It's when you start using it to tear others down that it becomes problematic. I also find it quite cute that you'd moralize after calling me further down the page a ""dirty tramp.""

I've never seen anything about ""excessively-profane-description memos"" and can't find anything about this from the Reddit search. My first post violates none of the rules in the sidebar and as far as I can tell adheres to Reddiquette. On the other hand, his response violates the Reddiquette to not ""[s]tart a flame war. Just report and ""walk away,"" to not ""[i]nsult others. Insults do not contribute to a rational discussion,"" and to not ""[t]roll. Trolling is in most cases off-topic and does not contribute to the conversation."" You violate two of these yourself later down the page. You also violate the rule to not ""follow those who are rabble-rousing against another redditor without first investigating both sides of the issue that's being presented.""

You aren't holier than anyone, so don't act the part."
98671,"I must be confused; I thought jokes were meant to be funny! Besides, why get so defensive over my joke? :)"
100412,"I could only base my responses off of what was posted. Your original post communicated three things to me. First, it communicated that [r/zelda](http://www.reddit.com/r/zelda) issued some sort of memo about profanity. Second, it communicated that I hadn't read the memo. Third, it communicated that for not having read this memo, I was somehow a nuisance from which [r/zelda](http://www.reddit.com/r/zelda) should escape. Given the bandwagon context and the large number of trolls that plague this subreddit, I feel this was a reasonable interpretation of events. I do want to make this subreddit a better place, so I actually followed up with a moderator to see if there was any such rule I missed. He claimed there was not, and apologized for the way the community treated my post.

If you meant ""memes,"" this changes things. Until you wrote that post, I did not see that as a reasonable interpretation of what you said since 1) the post did not say ""memes"" and 2) I wrote the post myself, and so it did not square with my conception of a meme. While I still don't feel that impersonal profanity is something from which to be escaped, I think you come across less as high-horsed and less as a moralizer if you are not shoving imaginary rules down my throat. An unnecessary insult is still an unnecessary insult regardless of whether you're quoting a movie or not, but you seem to have apologized for it. This post of yours is a lot more respectful in its tone and so does a lot to make me see you differently. In light of this I will retract my claims and apologize for them as well.

I'm unoffended by anything in this topic. I find it amusing to argue with people who tear me down, for I feel I do a much better job in dismantling them and their criticisms than they do of me and my posts. I do however sometimes feel that I waste my time when I argue with kids on the Internet and if given a choice would prefer to avoid it altogether. It's disincentivizing to me making good posts like the one I posted when I think when making them, ""Am I going to end up wasting my time arguing with some insecure, aggressive twit?"" The community is full of these and so they end up rearing their heads at random, unnecessary times.

Thanks for the positive words. I don't need an apology from you but I do respect you more for making one. I think this was a reasonable and adult way to deal with a situation instead of starting a petty back-and-forth of insults which, while amusing, just ends up devolving into a troll-off that wastes both our time."
102170,"An unfunny, unnecessary insult is still an unfunny, unnecessary insult, whether you quote something or not; and you know that tone doesn't communicate well over the Internet. In response to a Jew I could quote a movie where Hitler jokes about the Holocaust but it's still not in good taste, it's still not a good idea, and it's still not funny.

Regardless, you've apologized further up the page so this discussion need not continue."
