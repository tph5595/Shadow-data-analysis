0,"Here's a link to view the document that I've put all the info in. Sorry for the horrid formatting. I'm planning on designing a nice PDF book for it all. Enjoy, and lets discuss!

177,"This info is primarily about OOT, my favorite of the series. After reading through all of this I've found a new appreciation for the game. Knowing all the beta info makes you really understand why certain things are left in game. Also, the theories give the world of Hyrule a little more depth. 

Please enjoy! "
2395,"Agreed completely. During replays it can get tedious, but there was nothing like beating the water temple for the first time. 

It's one of those temples you love to hate, and thats what makes it so amazing."
2581,"I can't watch the video currently, because I'm in class, but this might provide some answers?

3832,"Ah alright, thats interesting. A lot cooler than just removing it due to complaints I'd say haha. I wish I'd had the chanting version as a kid. It adds such an on edge vibe to the temple.

I'll make the change in the document I posted. Most of that info is copy and pasted from random places, so anything that can be fixed I'm more than happy to change. "
7725,"I haven't played it either, but that does make a lot of sense! It works with the timeline as well.

You magic leak theory is interesting, because the way that the temple only has monsters in some places, and only some hallways get twisted, a slow leak would make total sense! 

I have to look into four swords now"
7801,"I may start compiling info as I come across it, but I don't think ill be seeking it out like I did for this. Nothing else can interest me the way Zelda does "
7936,"It's such a simple thought but it makes so much sense! Really adds another element of death into the game, as if there wasn't already enough "
23747,"The problem is that no other game really has as many crazy backstory glitches and facts like OOT. The transition from SNES to N64 is easily the biggest jump in technology and gameplay between 2 consoles, so there lie all these issues"
23757,thanks so much!
23811,"Thanks so much! You'll really wanna check this out

23880,"I have so much love for the other games, but I stated above that the problem is that no other game really has as many crazy backstory glitches and facts like OOT. The transition from SNES to N64 is easily the biggest jump in technology and gameplay between 2 consoles, so there lie all these issues. There is definitely info for the rest, but nothing this detailed."
47538,"Ill start looking into it! I am quite the sucker for wind waker, and the sea in real life."
47621,I'm gonna make a PDF book! Ill probably print  and bind a few for myself and friends. Ill make another post with the PDF someday!
47676,Anytime! In so glad to share with everyone!
48526,If you PM me ill email you the doc! 
110280,"Ah thats so lame! I watched them a long time ago before they were private and they were great. Originally, OOT was going to be first person! "
128306,Thanks so much! I'm glad I could share with everyone!
185316,The videos aren't private anymore! 
188942,I really need to actively look around for info like that about the rest of the temples. It's a real game changer
