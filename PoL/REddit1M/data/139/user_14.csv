9991,"I thought at least a couple dungeons in Majora's Mask were trickier than the Water Temple. As it should be. That's what was great about Zelda level design. They were tricky but all the clues were there to keep the pacing up.

The toughest part I remember of the OoT Water Temple was the floating platform in the center column concealing a room underneath. You can figure this out by experimentation and looking at the map. In the 3DS OoT, the camera ZOOMS INTO IT when you raise the water. I'm all for a little bit of hints here and there in games, but blatantly telling us the solutions kills the satisfaction of figuring things out for yourself."
