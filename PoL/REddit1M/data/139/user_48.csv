20303,"When you said you'd ""compiled information about Zelda"", I had assumed that would involve multiple games in the franchise. The information deep, and well phrased, and all in all a good read, but I was moderately disappointed by the lack of acknowledgement of the fifteen other great games, other than a couple nods to TP, but what this is is a temple by temple breakdown of OoT."
35564,"I apologise if I seemed perturbed. I was hoping for a game by game breakdown, but all I saw was Ocarina of Time. much as I love OoT, I was born into LttP, and had beaten the first four installments before OoT was even announced, and all I ever see on this sub is how fantastic the N64 duo were, with smatterings of Skyward Sword gripes and love for Wind Waker. I have nothing against you and I appreciate what you've done here, this just triggered some of my resentment at the under-representation of some of the classics in this sub as a whole.
