10052,"&gt;It is possible to beat other temples before the Forest Temple, if you leave after getting the bow and arrows.

You can complete the Fire Temple without getting the Fairy Bow. The only time you use the bow in the Fire Temple is for a shortcut to the map (or compass, can't remember). That's only a shortcut, though, so you can get it by going a different route. "
26494,Yeah. Through glitches... I'm saying that you can complete the Fire Temple without even entering the Forest Temple without any tricks or glitches. It's just a case of non-linearity.
