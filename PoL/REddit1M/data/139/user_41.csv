That's the real problem imo.  

Making something tedious doesn't make it special and unique, it just makes it a pain in the ass. 

If you played it on the 3ds, however, you wouldn't have experienced it because the improved interface fixed a lot of the annoyance with that temple. "

Six paragraphs of repetitive shitty jokes and you never actually managed to say *anything*. 

It's like you learned to write from cracked articles but never had the attention span to make it further than 2 sentences in.  

You need to drop all but the very best joke analogies and then follow them up with some actual *content*.    
You can't just repeat that something sucks and tell us that it's hard six dozen times.  You've got to back it up with something. "
