20265,"&gt;You have GOT to be kidding me. I didn't think Nintendo properly displayed that they were completely ball-less until they released Skyward Sword (which took zero risks and was very linear, to allow for the commongamer to be happy with it)... but now I know that it was in 2009.

Seriously? How is any other Zelda game more ""risky"" than SS? It had a completely new art style, a flying mechanic, *finally a completely re-made combat system*, and of course some innovative puzzles. 

If anything, SS was the biggest risk they've taken in a long time. "
53048,"Perhaps this is true, and I'd attribute it to Skyward Sword having so many more ways to mess up in combat. For an enemy with an electric shield, you will get damaged if you swing the wrong way. In previous Zeldas, there isn't a way to swing the wrong way because there was no motion control. "
54342,"&gt;A new art style isn't really a risk, I'm afraid to say. Pretty much every Zelda game has its own unique look, minus OoT and MM.

I must disagree. Twilight Princess, to me, looked a lot like OoT and MM. It was dark, had a sort of realistic look, and had some grotesque character faces. IMO WindWaker is the only one to really take a bold art direction. It went from dark and scary to colorful and cel-shaded. Oh, and I don't consider any of the 2D Zeldas to have taken a risk with their art. 

&gt;I wouldn't even say it was a ""risk"" because it was such a widely accepted expectation.

This is a good point. I just have a hard time ignoring it considering how drastic of a change it is. 

&gt;Calling them innovative isn't really right either, since any puzzle that's not innovative is simply a copy of something else, and gets flack for it.

I didn't go into detail because I want to avoid spoilers. By ""innovative"" I meant that the puzzles use new concepts instead of just new ideas with old concepts.

(EDIT: Spoiler tags do not work from your inbox. They only work on the subreddit. If you haven't played through SS, avoid the spoilers ahead)

Examples from SS that do this are [the puzzles that have you shifting between past and present with the orb](/spoiler) and [the last dungeon, with the rooms themselves being a sliding block puzzle](/spoiler). The farthest Twilight Princess went with completely new puzzle ideas is probably with the spinner, and those are barely puzzles. They are obstacle courses. 

&gt;Think of a sequel like MM.

I haven't played through MM so I don't know, sorry. 

&gt;The kinds of changes in style and plot between those two games... That's risk.

Okay, SS didn't have something so weird to Zelda like a moon falling and constant time rewinding, but it did have a sky world. The environment felt completely different from anything before. It felt a lot more open. The idea of all the villagers only knowing of the sky world, and not of the world below, is definitely refreshing in terms of story. 

Perhaps MM is a lot stranger to the series than SS is, but back then 3D Zeldas were new and they were still developing its formula. SS came out after 6 3D Zeldas have already been released, and the formula was super strong. It's harder to do something so different now when the fans have such vivid expectations. 

But Nintendo seems to manage."
