29398,"The Shadow Temple has always fascinated me. Death is a part of nature, and many ancient cultures had gods of death that were not necessarily evil. Yet here, it is more than a temple built out of respect for death and the dead. There is a definite aspect of torture and *wrongness* to the place. What does that tell us about Hylian theology - and, being that we know the goddesses are real, the world of Hyrule. Is evil just as much of an elemental force as fire or water?"
