4441246,"i think link was born with his family in the guardian house, which is now the forest temple.  It was raided and thats when his father died and he left with his mother fleeing to the nearest safe place, the deku tree and the kokori..... ive come to this after reading up to the explanation in the manga of how link ended up with the kokori and how his parents died"
