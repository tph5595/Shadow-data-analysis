85101,"There are two types of people, I think.  People who read, memorize and properly utilize maps in Zelda games and people that don't read maps.  I think more people fall in the 2nd category than you think."
85559,Don't forget the scene where Bongo Bongo burns Kakariko in his attempt to (totally my own theory) destroy the remainder of the Sheikah (Sheik).
85652,"I played this game when I was in high school, and it was pretty clear to me that Saria, Darunia and Ruto died, but maybe I was just reading into the subtext that was present in the dialogue."
85759,Four Swords' story just confused me.  Did anyone think Vaati was a compelling villain? He always seemed like an Aghanim knock-off.
86039,Four Swords is a GBA game (bundled with aLttP).  Nintendo later released Four Swords Adventures for GC which required a GBA with link cable for each player (a forerunner to the Wii U).
86383,"Wait, they CHANGED this song?  I LOVED the chanting! (I have only played the gold cartridge N64 game and was not aware it has been changed).  That's just ridiculous.  Religion is a major part of the human experience.  So are they going to go through every single Zelda game and remove all of the references to Shintoism?"
