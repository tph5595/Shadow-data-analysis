61425,"Actually, the information about the Fire Temple chants being scrapped due to Muslim outrage is outdated. All of the versions of the game were completed before the game was actually released.

It was recently confirmed by Nintendo themselves on GameTrailers's Pop Fiction series that the omission of the chants was actually because of two reasons:

1. It was discovered after being included in the game that it was a Muslim chant, and Nintendo went on to correct the issue for the remaining copies they had with the information in mind. No public outrage was involved, since the game was not released yet.

2. The sound clip, believe it or not, was used in ANOTHER N64 game that came out some time before Ocarina of Time. The game was called Cruisin' World, and the music ""Cairo Cruisin'"" uses the sound clip ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Spf3MnT-OiQ ). Nintendo was not aware before including the chants, and this potential copyright issue compelled them to not continue using it."
