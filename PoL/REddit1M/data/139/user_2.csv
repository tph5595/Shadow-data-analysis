2104,"""The original music was Muslim chanting, but was taken out due to complaints from the Muslim community, and people who thought Nintendo was trying to convert kids to Islam.""

Source?  I've never heard that they changed it because of complaints.

edit: You really should have mentioned that the italicized text about theories on all the temples was copied and pasted from the GameFaqs boards.

They looked at the ROM data for all the cart versions of OoT.  And I quote, ""What's odd is that every single N64 cartridge we tested out, whether it had the Fire Temple music or not, gave us a wrong completion date, prior to the earliest known release date of Ocarina of Time anywhere in the world.  (The video shows ""Date: 98-10-21"" on a ROM screen.)  That means the Fire Temple chants were removed prior to the game being made commercially available, period.  **While it is entirely possible that Nintendo received complaints about the original Fire Temple music after it's release, public outcry could not have been the reason for this revision.**  The likely reason people believed in this rumor is that version 1.2 didn't start hitting store shelves until well after Ocarina of Time's original release, in 1998.""

It goes on to mention a statement made in the September 2001 issue of Nintendo Power that suggests they made the change preemptively."
