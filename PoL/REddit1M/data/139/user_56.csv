26776,"ill say this one last time, the forest, fire, water, and shadow temples all took me the same amount of time to go through on a casual playthrough, after i haven't touched the game in 2 years. all approx 1hr 45 min. 
if i hear someone my age complain about the water temple, they are no longer my friend."
