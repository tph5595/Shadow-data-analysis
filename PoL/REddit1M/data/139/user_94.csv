51342,"But in the game, Volvagia was called an ancient dragon that was sealed away in the volcano, which is what Ganondorf revives. 

So which would it be..? I really love the idea of Volvagia being Link's pet as a child, but I just don't see him having a volcanic lizard/dragon while living in a forest (unless it was just your typical lizard?). I personally think that the ""reviving an ancient, dreaded demi-god"" thing makes it more fiersome and intimidating instead while being more fitting to the story. 

But that's just my opinion, and the conversational nature of /r/zelda here recently. I like it, a lot. "
51408,And we all thought Majora's Mask was the darkest game...
53528,"Well, to kind of add on to what you are saying, you have to remember that Link starts his adult journey with the Medallion of Light. So if light and dark are elemental forces in the game, then Spirit must be, also...

Not quite sure how this adds to what you were saying, but I felt inclined to add it."
53600,"I'd love you forever if you did... I honestly don't think it has to be ""hidden"" secrets like OoT has. It can even be lesser known facts and history, or even really good fan theories, and I'd be one happy child. 

Keep up the great work!"
53951,"I actually had the intention of posting about this exact thing (excluding Fi, as I have yet to play SS). 

The post describes the ""old"" Blue Fairy as *the design for the Great Fairies.... with short hair, a blue dress and being entirely tinted blue, and wings.* This sounds a lot like the fairies in Wind Waker, just minus out the wings. 

For those that don't know what the fairies in WW look like, here's one of the [Great Fairies](http://zeldawiki.org/images/thumb/5/54/Great_Fairy_Bombs.png/230px-Great_Fairy_Bombs.png) and the [Queen Fairy](http://www.zeldauniverse.net/images/games/tww/characters/queenfairy.png). "
