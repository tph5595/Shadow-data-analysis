Anyone play the 3DS version? They simplified the dungeon."
65212,"The dungeon had glowing markings on various walls and corridors to mark where the player must go and to make changing the water level more clear. An additional camera scene was added in the central tower of the dungeon to make the location of a commonly and easily missed Small Key more obvious. And the Dark Link fight was easier. 

Edit: As Viper_H said with the glowing markings. Also, as SpankMyMetroid and LinksAwakening42 say, the iron boots were an item. That made it a lot easier to switch."
