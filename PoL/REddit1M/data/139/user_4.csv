7093,"&gt;Thus, I feel that the FT is a castle, although more precisely a stronghold as a final defense.Inside, there are fine carpets, many rooms, a fairly relaxing courtyard (if monsters werenâ€™t around). This makes me believe that nobility or royalty used the FT as a final stand against invaders, and that they hid here.

.... What if the Forest Temple is Hyrule Castle from Four Swords? That might explain the four ghosts, indicative of the Four Sword resting in the castle. It's power may have leaked a bit or something like that, like radiation, creating the four spirits. Or perhaps Vaati's seal is weakening again and this is part of his power escaping. The spirits are the right colors, after all, green, red, blue, and purple. We already know that there was a war just before OoT, that would explain why this castle might have been lost. If Vaati's magic is indeed leaking, that would also explain why the whole castle is twisted and dimensionally weird, his magic is corrupting the whole place. The Stalfos would then be the old Knights of Hyrule. The Four Sword is also shown as being in a kind of foresty shrine in Four Swords.

EDIT: The magic leak might also be responsible for Phantom Ganon (indirectly). This is (according to the timeline) the first time in the Zelda universe that Ganon is shown as making a copy of himself. This could be his use of some of the leaked magic, harnessing and twisting the power of the Four Sword to make a copy of himself. Also found this while researching the validity of all this: ""Unlike the other four temples in the game, the Forest Temple does not seem to have a recurring statue found throughout the dungeon. There is the totem pole, dragon, raven and snake statues within the Fire Temple, Water Temple, Shadow Temple and Spirit Temple, respectively. These statues could indeed represent some sort of temple guardian, but if that is true, the Forest Temple is left without any representation."" from http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Forest_Temple_(Ocarina_of_Time)  The reason there aren't any guardian statues in this temple is because it wasn't intended to be a spirit temple when it was built.

Though, I haven't played Four Swords (past the first 2 minutes) because I didn't figure out how to avoid having to play with other people on the emulator, so I don't know if all of that holds up. Anyone have any thoughts?"

33505,"Well, Four Swords is after Minish Cap and just before Ocarina of Time, so it would matter where it ends up at the end of Four Swords. From what I've read, [Vaati gets resealed in the Four Sword](/spoiler), but I never read where the sword actually ends up physically residing. I would guess in the same place it was left in Minish Cap, in the lowest levels as you said, but perhaps not.

If it is in the basement, that would be another little connection. Maybe, after the events of Four Swords, they tried to hide away the area of the castle that housed the sword, and the four flames was one of the initial challenges. Originally, the flames were held in some ceremonial manner, but Ganon's forces (the poe sisters) stole them. That would mean that the little puzzle area with the rotating walls is another challenge to get lower, and we just don't do that in OoT.

Course, most of that is incredibly circumstantial, but how cool would it be?"
35132,"I did the same thing. I actually thought that I used keys in the wrong places or something and *started over my game*. Kinda my fault for not realizing they wouldn't make it so that you might have to do that, but in my defense, I was like, less than 10 years old. Still sucked."
37604,"Yeah, they're separate entries on the timeline, and FSA is on the Gamecube while the original Four Swords is shared on a cartridge on the GBA with A Link to the Past."
