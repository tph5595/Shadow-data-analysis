7330,"If you are around that area you will speak to people who talk about someone that was sneaking in. There is another area outside of town where you can trade, sleep, etc. That person is somewhere in that area. If you want a spoiler version let me know. "

22281,"Most of the towns have somewhere to buy at least some arrows. [Gerudo and Tarry Town have the best shops as they carry all varieties of arrows. They also carry bigger bundles of them.] (/spoiler) You can also ""farm"" regular arrows with a glitch. Get to an area where someone is shooting arrows at you and move the camera to looking down directly over your head. You will take no damage and can collect the arrows as they come. Make sure to collect them as only 10 arrows can be on the ground at once. "
