2523,"So last night I got the Hylian shield, then I was in the field to the west of Akkala stables with the guardians taking a few out. I had used the shield on nothing else yet but I think it broke halfway through? Even with Daruk's protection? I feel like I must have done something funny. Anyway, only way to get it back is Tarrey town, correct? I don't have that vendor set up yet. "
2559,Phrenic bow i think does that. And also the ancient bow possibly?
2936,"I think, and I could be 100% wrong, that the bow that spawns in the flight center north of Rito village is Phrenic. Its not super high damage but I think it zooms? "
5540,I...am an idiot. i thought it was the hylian shield that auto blocked. :(
5557,Sorry! Good luck finding the phrenic! 
10257,It definitely was not 27. I'm wondering if I dropped it somehow and i didn't see it on the ground. I had it one second then not. Oh well. I should have reloaded to 5 minutes before but I kept playing.
