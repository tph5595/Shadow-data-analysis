57767,"(Wii u) i have wolf link amiibo, completed cave of shadows, and i love using my 19 heart wolf link. If i buy another brand new wolf link amiibo, can i use it on my same twilight princess, run him through the end to 19 hearts, and give it to my friend?"
58003,Or can you only assosciate 1 wolf link amiibo with one save file?  Will i have to beat most of the game to fill out a second wold link amiibo?
