5066,"Luminescent stones can be traded for another item. Useful when you're short of the other, rarer item. I think I've traded about 100 so far (it's a many to one trade)."
5302,"I would suggest a 3 shot bow, the Forest Dweller's Bow, which is a respawn in an island cave southwest of Lanayru Tower, rather than the Ancient Bow. Even though you have to account for arrow drop, having 3 shots makes up for it.

Additionally, the Golden Bow zooms, and that's right in Gerudo town, next to the guards in the training area."

Ie, don't auto parry a single guardian - deal with single guardians the old fashion way, by parrying yourself, shooting the eye, or stasis it. Save the auto parry for when you're targeted by multiple guardians and can't break line of sight."
