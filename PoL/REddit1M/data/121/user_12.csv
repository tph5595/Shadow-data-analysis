4457,"So, I went through a ton of effort and about 400 dollars to get my Switch and the Zelda game.

I've put about 4-5 hours in to the game so far.

I haven't accomplished much. I am still on the Plateau. I've talked to the Old Man. I've been on top of the tower, spotted three of the shines, and went through them. I have the rune that lets me freeze, lets me stop time, and lets my use the magnet type power.

For the life of me, I cannot find the fourth shrine that I need to beat to get the glider from the old man.

It is driving me crazy.

I don't want someone to just tell me where the shrine is. I want someone to tell me what to look for when I'm on the tower, so I can find it myself.

I feel so dumb for not being able to figure this out.

Also, I found the Old Man's house. I know I can make him some food with meat and seafood and pepper and he will give me a coat.

I've seen various animals, randomly. I haven't been able to kill one yet. Now I cannot seem to find any large animal to hunt. I assume this is how I get meat. I have no idea how to get seafood. What am I doing wrong?

Any help is appreciated. I'm on the verge of just giving up."
