3046,"If you have discovered the ""Hyrule Kingdom"" location, north-north/west part of the great plateau (afaik), could you please take a picture or screenshot of the map showing the name? I think it's the only thing I'm missing for the 100% and acording to a map I'm checking it should be there but I've been walking around, up and down the great plateau, for a while now and it's not registering in my map :\"

Thank you :)"
