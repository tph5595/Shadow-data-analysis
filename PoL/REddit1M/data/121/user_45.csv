The four initial shrines are fairly dispersed. Meaning that if you've found shrines at the 3 O'clock, 6 O'clock, and 9 O'clock positions, well, maybe you're missing one around the 12 O'clock position. 

Don't overthink things either. Seafood = fish, crabs, etc. If there aren't any large bodies of water around, then you may not be able to access those resources right at this moment. 

Animals are flighty. You'll need to sneak up on them to kill them. It's much easier with a bow. 

Perhaps the old man is offering you a coat because you need to go somewhere cold ...?

Hope this helps :) Don't get discouraged!"

Hit the last cluster of five with a bomb arrow. 

At the end you can jump of your horse and freeze time with your bow. If you have enough time and stamina you can get up to 8 or so targets this way.

Good luck! "
26307,"You're doing well. Free the Divine Beasts should give you four weigh-points on your map? I would just choose one and meander in that direction. You'll encounter a ton of shrines, towers, and questions on the way. 

When you get there, there won't just be a divine beast waiting for you. Instead some other plot-related stuff will happen. It varies with each destination. "
