also for future realses (as i've heard word about a fierce deity link coming out along with another Loz amibo . . . i forget everything after i herd fierce deity lol)  this website http://slist.amiami.com/top/search/list?s_seriestitle_id=1004&amp;pagemax=40&amp;getcnt=0&amp;pagecnt=2 
  
its a japanese import site and their pretty good with preordering and restocks. Just check back frequently for restocks and try to place a preoder the second you hear about a new amibo coming out. 
  
Currently their Shipping fees will probably cost you around 20 bucks or less but if your buying a few things it evens out since their base price is usually a few bucks cheaper. e.g a 12 dollar ambio only costing about 7 when imported. 
  
Finally, if your gonna get a zelda amibo, try to get your hands on that twilight princess ambio. It lets you summon wolf link and haveing a doggo running around with you in game is tons of fun when exploring and imo is the best amibo. Plus if you set your sheika sensor to find something like hearty truffles, if you get in the general area of the item he goes all bloodhound on you and leads you there! incredibly helpful. "

Like wow there goes my travel buddy, and epona doesnt do mountains :/"
