23377,"I'm about 10 hours in and have the following Main Quest missions available

* Destroy Ganon: This seems like the ultimate goal, not something I can do now

* Free the Divine Beasts: This seems like something I do later in the game, not 10 hours in

* Captured Memories: I've found one so far, but this seems like something that will take me the majority of the game

I also have two Side Quests available

* Robbie's Research: This is *miles* away

* Slated for Upgrades: I don't have the necessary parts yet

It seems like I can only really do two things here... keep hunting for the captured memory spots or go for the long hike and do Robbie's side mission. 

None of these missions really match the forward moving narrative the game has displayed so far. Am I missing something? "
