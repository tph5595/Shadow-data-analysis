7129,Dinraal (red) doesn't go thru Akkala to my knowledge.  But he does swoop down to the  great skeleton north of the volcano if you like that better.  FWIW my favorite place to farm Dinraal was Hebra tower as he flies through the canyon.

30462,Might've been me.  I post that link every once in a while and used it to confirm my 42 shrine and 76 side quests.  I believe that list is accurate.  
30763,"Correct.  After finishing the main storyline, you can talk to Kilton about monsters, which mean you can then pursue his three medals for killing all 4 Molduga, 40 Hinox, and 40 Talus.  Having talked to him about it, you will see that ⭐️ Defeated next to the monster if you have defeated it previously.  Not related to map completion."
