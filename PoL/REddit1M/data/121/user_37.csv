20253,"Some additional advice: I tried farming Dinraal here, but found that he (she?) would stop appearing after 1-2 times unless I left the area and came back. The method I eventually got to work was:

1. Wait until morning at the fire
2. Look at the sky and see if Dinraal is descending (he comes down almost directly above the great skeleton's head)
3. If he's a no-show after ~30 seconds, save the game
4. Immediately load the save I just made
5. Once loaded back in, Dinraal would show up like 90% of the time and I could grab the part I needed
6. Go back to step 1

I'm still not sure what determines whether or not the dragons spawn, but by saving and reloading I was able to get him to appear pretty consistently."
22680,"Did one of the recent updates change the frequency that regular arrows drop from enemies? 

Throughout the entire game, I was always running low on plain arrows and often had to use Fire/Electric/Ice because that was all I had. Enemies rarely dropped them, and when they did it was usually just a single arrow. I was buying them from shops whenever I could so that I wasn't wasting the more expensive arrows.

But suddenly, almost every enemy is dropping the ""Arrow x5"" item, sometimes more than one of them. I went from having practically no regular arrows to almost 400 in just a few hours of running around exploring.

Is that something that changed recently? Or is there some trigger that makes arrows drop more often after beating Ganon/finding all of the shrines/completing the Compendium?"

29739,"I mean, I played for 100 hours and was starved for arrows the entire time. I haven't changed my behavior at all, and suddenly I'm swimming in them. That seems like more than just bad luck or my own obliviousness.

Are you finding one or more 'Arrow x5' items on every enemy you kill?"

29940,"Have you defeated Ganon and reloaded the ""star"" save? I've heard that's when it starts showing up, though I don't know for sure if it's true. Also, what's your map completion percentage? I wonder if that ties in as well."
