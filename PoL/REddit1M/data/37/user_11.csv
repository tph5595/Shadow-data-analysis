6190,I'd been killing the monsters expecting to get some kind of reward from the victim. Nope. Nothing. 
6350,"I was doing a shine quest last night that involved carrying one of those orange orbs a really long distance to the pedestal. I had to put it down to fight some moblins, and one of them picked up the orb and threw it at me. Don't you throw *my orb* at me, bro. "
9129,"I saw the pedestal from the cliff and figured out I needed to bring the orb all the way there. You way sounds time consuming but easier. There were a couple points where the orb almost went into the water and I took damage trying to save it, but that's better than losing the orb to the water and not being able to get to it. Or having to push it back to the shore. "
9157,Really? Nobody has ever given me anything and I've saved quite a few people before I stopped for lack of reward. 
27843,Ohhh that's smart. For some reason cryonis is the rune that never occurs to me for very practical uses.
