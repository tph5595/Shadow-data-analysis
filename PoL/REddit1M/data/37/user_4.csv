2860,"You know that song that plays when you battle a Lynel? The one that gets your blood pumping? And also plays when you battle a Yiga footsoldier?  

I can't find it anywhere. Not on Google, not on YouTube, not even on ""full OSTs"" uploaded to YouTube. It's driving me crazy. I really really like the song and, being such a good song, I find it unbelievable that it's so rare.   

Has anyone got a name or a reason for its mysterious absence from so many full OSTs? Or, pray tell, a youtube link for the song?"
