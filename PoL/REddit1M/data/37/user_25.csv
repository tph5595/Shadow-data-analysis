15338,"Very easy. Completed shrines are all blue on the map, while by incomplete ones the inner icon is orange on the map. If a shrine is totally orange on the map, then you've found it, but did not activate it yet (you cannot teleport there unless it's activated).

Furthermore you can see on the map if there are still chests inside a shrine. Just select a shrine with the cursor on the map. If there is a chest icon by its name, then you've found all chests inside. If not, seek further ðŸ˜‰"
15486,There's no limit of armor you can have.
15606,"There you go. It also tells other important stuff, so Spoilers inside. You can switch on/off just what you want.

16437,"1) Coliseum Ruins. East of Outskirt Stable.

2) Yes, but very very late. You can also use some Amiibo to get different sets, but the one you'll find at that late moment in the game is the best one of them regarding upgrading in Defence.

3) There's always Slo-mo if you use your Bow in the Air. Furthermore the motions slows down if you manage to dodge an attack at the right moment. Very good for critical counterattacks. The shrine in Kakariko teaches you that. "
18367,This shrine is uncovered without a shrine quest. So no quest.
22616,"I'm not sure if this works, but at the northern side of the Island, left of the platform you have to place an orb, there are some rocks. While I was in the test I wanted to go there, because of a treasure chest. Just before I was there the shrine monk said the test would be over if I go further, so I presume those rocks are not within the test area.

Long story short: Try landing there and save. If this works it's a much shorter way to the Island. "
24443,I think we'll have to wait for the DLC for that. 
68575,"About attack and defense power, your assume is right. By now there's no way to tell how much your items are damaged other then those you mentioned.

The set bonuses depends of the set. It's individual. For example, wearing full rubber armors makes you invulnerable to lightning, even with metal weapons or shields equipped.

Edit: You have to upgrade each piece of an armor set at least once by a great fairy to gain the set bonus."
68861,"Nope, there's no path. Impa told you the location is not that far away from here (Kakariko). Seek further."
71308,Hard to tell which are missing. You did the 3 mazes? Visited all islands? Spoke to all people around villages/stables to be sure there are no more shrine quests still to be found?
71572,"They often spawn in Hyrule Field. I'm not sure what triggers it. Just walk around, beat enemies and such and they will show up eventually."
75099,"If you don't want to look in a guide map, there's no way except more exploring. This is up to you."
