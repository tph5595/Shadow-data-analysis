2299,"There's a whole lot of banana trees in the Faron region (as well as hearthy durians)

Also I think the big stack inside the Yiga hideout respawn over time, probably each blood moon

for elixir the best are dragon parts but they require some tedious farming. Save your monster parts for Kilton except if you already bough all his expensive stuff (and also guts are usefull for some armor upgrades)"
3782,"1 If it's a yellow beam, it's a shooting star that despawn at 5 AM.

2 Do you have the stasis+ module? you can't stasis them if you don't. Also be wary the time window is extrememly short.    
Either that using it to shoot arrow in his eye, putting it in stasis stop the firing process, so it can help you close the gap and start whacking one of his legs, stunning him and allowing you to destroy another one    
A good thing is to have any + or ++ guardian weapon which do added damage (even more if you get the set bonus for the ancien armor available at the akkala lab)

or you can parry their blasts like a man :p (require 3 hit and perfect timing)"
4036,"you're probably trying to repair the Ceremonial Trident instead (which doesn't require diamond). It is hidden in the Zora domain and linked with a sanctuary quest, speak to NPCs to get clues to where it is. 

(it's also less powerfull that the Lightscale Trident btw)"
9238,"you have to finish the tarrey town quest first, then you'll find here a Merchand that sells every unique gears for 4k rupees each"
9328,"you will reload just before the fight, and you'll only gain a fancy completion counter that will indicates you that you only completed about 40% of the game :p (thanks to all them korok seeds)"
10610,"Go for a hunt in Tabantha snowfield. Each animals drop 3 pieces of meat that can be prime or gourmet meat, cook them by stacks of 5, you'll get 210 rupees for 5 prime and 490 for 5 gourmet.

You'll easily make thousands in no time"
10705,Well in what place could you possibly find some fine hylian weaponry?
11516,yes
20162,Any town at night
22406,"there's a small rock with a chest on it north west of the island (right beside one of the three orb receptacle), that doesn't count as being part of the challenge. If you ever happens to die during it you'll respawn there.

edit : if you got there before starting the challenge"
22755,"you'll drown in bokoblin guts as the game progresses and you encounter stronger variations of the bokoblins. You can also buy some at kakariko village

For the stealthfin trout the best is south of the great forest (or the Saria lake if you've beaten the trial of second sight), if possible at night (they glow like all stealthy materials)"
64618,"for the red there's a bunch that respawn every blood moon near the abandonned north mine at the goron village. Just have to be quick to loot or else it gets burned to oblivion.

For the yellow, go to the gerudo desert and turn your Sheika detector on (you may even happens to encounter some red ones on the way). Ambushed electric lizardfos seem to respawn indefinitely. Shouldn't take you that long to get all yellow tails required for your gear upgrade"
65306,"Kakariko : south shore of the lake behind impa's house

Hateno : West of the blue flame

Zora domain : near the veiled falls

tarrey town : on the shores of the lake east of the town

rito village : South east of the flight range

Gerudo town : north west of the town

Lurelin : south of the village

Goron village : guess it's too hot for him there
"
80054,"Gardians of extreme tests of strength also drop them, and do respawn each blood moon"
86839,there's an NPC travelling between the Hateno village and fort Hateno selling ancien materials. Dunno about cores though
