65260,"What do the numbers under items in your inventory mean? I understand that bigger = better but what do the numbers indicate? For example, does the sword number indicate attack power vs the shield number represents defense power? How do I know how much my items are damaged? I only know that they are either perfect (gold sparkle) or close to dead (flashing red). For armor sets, how do set bonuses work?"
