71133,"I need a Windcleaver, I've gone back to the Hideout after a blood moon and the Blademasters haven't respawned. 

I hear that they will attack you out in the open but I've only had the regular members with the bows/sickles. Anyone know how I can encounter one or is it just luck? 

I've probably played about 10 hours since finishing Naboris. "

Unfortunately you can't ride them off into the sunset but no game can be perfect. "
73995,I've got 4 shrines left to hunt down so I guess I'll get walking around the map and hope one jumps me. Thanks dude.
84920,I've got ~115 and only had the normal foot soildiers. FeelsBadMan. 
85370,"Hmm. Are you directly behind him, like where his butt is?

Try go into slow-mo and shoot at his head with a x3 bow until you hear the headshot noise, then you'll be good. If you don't hear the headshot sound you won't be able to mount them. 

I killed 3 Silver Lynels last night using the stun/mount method exactly as I described it. "
