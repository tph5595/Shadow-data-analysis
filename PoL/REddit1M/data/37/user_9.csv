4992,"Has anyone else experienced a Moblin picking up a Bokoblin and throwing them at you? 120 hours in and I am still experiencing new things for the first time. Same session I had a Bokoblin pick up a Pebblit and throw it at me. 

This game is just too good."
5169,"This is one way, but it's also a very quick way to burn through shields.

A much simpler, cheaper, and safer way to deal with them is to crit them with a regular arrow then run right up to their face. Once right on top of them then cut off a leg. This stuns them again, allowing you to make your way all the way around leg by leg. When they're a potplant then hack until they're dead. Arrow to the eye if necessary."
5663,"Eh, when you get more experienced then it's way faster and easier to stun them and spin-to-win with a Savage Lynel Crusher. Takes like 5 seconds to kill them and you can get through 4-5 Guardians before durability becomes an issue.

Alternatively this is like the only thing in the game which the Master Sword is good for, and finally there is the guardian weapons.

I don't like to play the game by save-cheesing, and if that is off the table then I don't like losing good shields constantly by trying to be perfect on twitch mechanics which take far longer to kill guardians anyway since you need to wait for them to charge 3 times."
6576,"I know the exact quest you're talking about, that's really funny.

When I first visited that location I didn't know it was a shrine I was dealing with, so I cleared out all the enemies first before having to go **all the way back** to find the orb. Was frustrating, but far easier I guess."
9449,"This was literally my first pedestal quest. I didn't know what it was, so I went to investigate. When I got there and realised something was missing then I had to go back and look for the orb. I'd definitely escort it with me if I knew what it was about in the beginning."
43636,Use a Boko Club then. Literally any 2 handed weapon. 
43676,Shoot them in the eye.
56807,On the Switch above the game in the menu click on your profile and it will be right there. Rounds to the nearest 5 hours by the looks of it.
