37587,"I love Zelda to death, and still haven't played BOTW. I have a Wii U, but I might be selling it later in the year to get a Switch (definitely going to purchase one, only later on when bundles are available). The hype is very intense for BOTW, my question is should I buy/play it now on Wii U and then sell it later on or wait maybe even a year to play it on Switch? I guess the real question is; is this a game that you intend on keeping/playing a year down the road, or something worth waiting for so that you can keep it forever?"
