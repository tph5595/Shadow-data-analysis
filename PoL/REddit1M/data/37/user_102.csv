87456,There's a tower to the west of the castle (near the giant mushroom field that has the persistent thunder storm). It's in the middle of a lake with lots of lizard men things stalking around and those annoying floaty wizard things all around the tower. I'm not sure I can fight my way through them all to climb the tower (I'm struggling to engage them one at a time without triggering more). Is there another way or an optimal way to approach it? Thanks!
87543,Yeah this is like the lightning indicator during a storm. It's just showing you which weapons you probably shouldn't equip.
