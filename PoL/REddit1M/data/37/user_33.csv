23119,"% complete is map completion. Basically everything that isn't on your map when you start, but gets added to your map as you explore. So this is shrines, korok seeds, divine beasts, and named locations (bridges, rivers, etc that only get put on the map when you go there). 

Each item accounts for 0.08%. That means a korok seed is the same % as a divine beast. 

Edit: not 0.8%"

I've found some of the good timings to shoot him is while he's winding up for the big explosion, and after he's done shooting fireballs."
41699,Yes but all of the new saves will have a star too.

Are you having trouble finding it?"

The content of the image is pretty important. What do you see in the image?"

Edit: I may have sounded a bit condescending there. I mean to say that there is enough information between the guardians in the image and Impa's hint to point to one location. All of us have gotten the wrong idea about something before, and wasted time looking in the wrong places, so I don't fault you for that. I just think it's better to assume that pointing out the guardians is enough, until someone asks for more."
