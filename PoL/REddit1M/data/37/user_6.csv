3734,"In the Zora domain there is a person who says he can repair your trident. When I try to repair it he says something along the lines of ""your trident is somewhere in the world, you need to find it before I can repair it"". Does this mean I dropped the trident somewhere? I don't remember throwing it and I'm almost sure I used it until it broke."
