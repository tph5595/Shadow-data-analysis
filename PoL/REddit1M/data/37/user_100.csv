83961,"I've found with bugs and lizards, you don't need any stealth upgrades at all. As long as you are in stealth mode, they will never flee from you, even if you use the stealth ""jump"" to travel faster.

With the full Sheikah set though, I can run up to them in normal speed (not sprint) and they will not run away until I am right on top of them. Makes it super easy to gather them quickly."
84944,"As others have said, they have to slump over to be able to be mounted. The easiest way to get this to happen, is to shoot them in the head. They have a very small hit-box compared to the size of their head, so don't be surprised if it doesn't always work. Just keep trying different angles until you hit.

Also if you've completed the Divine Beast in the desert, the special ability from there should also bring it to it's knees."

Twice. Every part of the set needs to be level 2 or higher for the bonus to kick in."
86208,"Doesn't work in stasis, so there's that at least. But yeah, you have to get really close to them. For me, the prompt to mount only shows up if I'm literally running into them until I stop. I usually mount from the rear or far back on one of the sides, never tried from the front as someone else has posted."
89825,"Does anyone else experience the random Blood Moons that can happen any time of day? 

I keep seeing people referring to the Blood Moons only happen at midnight, but I quite often get them in the middle of day, and often times I will get several in a row. The first time I dared to fight a guardian, I got 3 blood moons in a row! I ended up using almost all of my food and weapons and that damn guardian just kept respawning.

In the cases where they happen consecutively, they also appear with only about 3-5 seconds of warning, so not enough time to really react."
