2997,"Got some stupid questions here... I've been avoiding reading threads and whatnot to play through myself but stuck on a few things...

1. Over by where you first meet kass, I swear I saw a huge beam of light shooting up from the ground, but it keeps changing positions before I can get to it. Any idea what this is?

2. I know a lot of people are using stasis to kill guardian s but I can't seem to get close enough to use anything before they kill me. Any tips?
