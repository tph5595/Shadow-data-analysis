17019,"I'm at 114 shrines, and I think the 6 I have left are all shrine quests. I don't want to look up a map of where shrines are but I'm worried that one shrine I completed is a shrine quest and not a ""wild"" one so to speak.

So can anyone tell me if there is a shrine quest associated with the Tho Kayu shrine in the desert? If there is then I still have one more shrine I have to find with the shiekah sensor."
