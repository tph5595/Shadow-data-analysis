91169,Same here. Probably because you can usually find other solutions. There's a puzzle where you get trapped between gates. I never noticed the water on the floor; instead just used Stasis and ran under the gate when it popped up.
91292,I wonder if they do anything if you drop truffles in front of them.
91465,"Ammibo weapons do not appear in the compendium (if you point at them with the camera, it doesn't show a box and the name). That's probably evidence enough that they don't appear in game."
91590,"This actually messed me up, because there's multiple places in the game matching the ""content"" you mention. Went to the wrong one and wandered around for too long :(

If you look at the mountains in the background, you can use that to make sure you're in the right general area."
91724,"The percentage counter mentioned above is only for map completion. There are other things not counted.

Also, defeating Ganon gives one other ""ability"": an indicator appears next to the health bar of overworld minibosses that you've already defeated."
91915,"If you try this on the island, the game says ""you can't save right now"" or something like that. "
91997,"Similarly you can cook an eat anything with ""hearty"" in the name to get temp hit points."
92099,"Besides what others have mentioned, talk to people at the south goron mines (about halfway to the city). Someone there can help you as well."
95035,"I'd suggest finding this NPC when it's raining. Travelling merchants offer different wares when the weather is bad, you might get lucky."
97889,"I think I just completely missed her hint about ""near"". Saw the picture and thought I knew exactly where it was because I remembered only one place matching that description (the area west of Tarrey Town). I had only ever walked by the correct area once, and I guess I didn't notice the broken guardians."
