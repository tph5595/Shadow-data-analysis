10112,I still have no idea where the Hylian shield is. I could go kill Ganon right now but I refuse to do it without the damn shield. But I also don't want to be told where it is because I won't feel accomplished. It's killing me. 
10855,... the castle ?
11266,OH. That's why ! I didn't want to enter the castle without the shield --' Thank you !
