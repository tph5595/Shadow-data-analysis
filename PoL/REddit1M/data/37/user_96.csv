80958,Where would you recommend to go after completing Zora's domain (and my first of the four beasts) After the shock of fighting a Lynel I don't think my poor heart can take it haha. Should I go to Goron City or Akkala... or something else all together? I tried running into the centre of Hyrule but constantly hearing the guardian song start up made my heart go funny and bring in this need to go do a side quest or look for Korok seeds instead ðŸ˜…

115902,Thank you! I'll head there next :D
