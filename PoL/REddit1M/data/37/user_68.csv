48778,"So along my adventures I've come across many, and I mean a lot, of circles created out of rocks, I have even come across three circles forming a kind of triangle shape, do these circles somehow connect to the korok quest, (sorry if I spelled korok wrong, I haven't really paid attention to spelling, silly me ðŸ˜…) 

if they do tie in how do I activate them, because most of the puzzles for them involve moving a rock, or block into a hole, or laying an apple in a dish..."
