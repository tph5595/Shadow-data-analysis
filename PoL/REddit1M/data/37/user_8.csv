4072,Has anyone gotten a triple 5 star horse yet? I've been looking. I've gotten a ton of 4-4-5s but haven't even seen one with two 5 star ratings. Do they exist? 
4267,2 - learn to reflect their shots with shields. At least until you can regularly afford ancient arrows for 1 shot kills. 
5323,"As long as you land the reflects the shield takes zero damage. Also running around cutting each leg and then slashing down the guardian is the quickest way to burn through weapons. 

Save before every guardian fight. Reflect all 3. If you mess up load, and try again. Zero shield loss. Also get the Hylian shield which can reflect like 30 plus lasers. "
13149,"Fair reasoning for you personally but if people are struggling with guardians I don't imagine they have  lynel clubs. Hylian shield can literally eat like 30+ lasers and is only 3k to replace and easy to get in early game so you don't have to save cheese. . Both methods are fair, undoubtedly. "
200353,Can you take a picture of that. My understanding was that the white royal horse had set stats. 
200426,You have a 535? How can we confirm that there isn't anything that has 14/15 overall cos it's driving me crazy.
