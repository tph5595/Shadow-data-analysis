72901,"Man, I killed like 50 guardians now (runners, watchmens, cannon). And the compendium says they drop ancient giant cores. And I saw them dropping ones (if you ask me, the watchmens have a higher chance dropping them).

I just need one ancient giant core more but they just don't drop it anymore. I now killed really like 50 of them. I now have 1300 of the other parts. And got 22 normal cores. One thing which is different I defeated Ganon from the ancient giant core before.
