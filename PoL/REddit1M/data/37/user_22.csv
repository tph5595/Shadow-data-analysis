12009,"For the guardians, I recommend running as your primary strategy for most of the game.

Most will tell you to parry with your shield. If you can get the timing right, perfect. You can battle Guardians as soon as you've got the practice in.

I still haven't got it right. If you're finding difficulty with shield reflecting, grab a good bow: high damage is all you need, multi-shot is excellent. Lynel bows are the best combination. With those, even normal arrows will take out huge chunks of health at a time, and each shot stuns the Guardian."

Chopping off legs to get more ancient supplies is a fair deal, and you can always carry a weaker utility weapon from bokoblins for smashing stuff."

They can take care of themselves. After the 5th time rescuing them, getting no reward, and having them talk about how great truffles are... yeah."
12579,The truffle sisters don't give food. Everyone else you rescue will.
12656,"Sell your ore and monster parts. I know, it's crazy, but the game straight up tells you that ore is for selling, and it's right.

Don't worry about upgrading armour pieces you don't plan on wearing much. Convert them into rupees, and there are more than enough chests, ore deposits and, later, silver enemies to keep you topped up."

58902,Lucky. All I ever get is truffle excitement and hardly a thank you.
