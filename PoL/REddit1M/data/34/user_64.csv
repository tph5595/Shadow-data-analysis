28563,"So how many times can you upgrade armor and does it matter at which fairy you do it? I'm super confused because multiple guides online say that each fairy can only upgrade your armor once, but I'm pretty sure I've upgraded multiple pieces of armor more than once at the same fairy (I always go to the one at Kakariko). I've discovered three great fairy fountains so far."
