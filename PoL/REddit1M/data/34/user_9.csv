4035,"I asked yesterday and got some advice, but I still have not been able to mount a lynel.  I Stasis+ it, shoot it in the eye with an arrow, it kneels, and I'm right next to it but it never gives me the option to mount it.  Maybe Stasis+ is cheating?  If it matters, all I've faced so far are red/blue lynels."
