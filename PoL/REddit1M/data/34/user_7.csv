Absolutely worth it."
12888,Probably not the best place to ask but does anybody know the route for the All Main Quests speedrun ? The WR is Japanese so I can't read the splits :/ and I couldn't find the route
25323,"This is especially why I want a route.

Essentially the ""route"" in a speedrun is the order in which you do things. Because the goal is to be fast so you're gonna want to do in the fastest order, not a random one like on your first  playthrough right ? So for AMQ you need to do the 4 divine beasts, all memories and 24 shrines total. I started making a route but knowing me it will probably end up slower than the order that is being used right now. Hence the question.
