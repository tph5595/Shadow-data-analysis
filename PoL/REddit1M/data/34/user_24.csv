12041,"Hey there! I'm looking for Red Lynels due to the fact I can beat them! I really can't beat the Silver/White one yet. I just found one red right now (the one over the Zora's domain); are there any others? Thanks!

Edit: and I'm struggling finding a memory, the one with the white gate with a snowy mountain on the back. Where's that place?"
