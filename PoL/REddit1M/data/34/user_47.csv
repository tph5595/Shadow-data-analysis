18288,"I asked the same thing yesterday, and was coming back to ask again - I just can't for the life of me figure out why everyone else makes it sound so simpleâ€¦ the only time I can reliably mount them is directly after the charge attack where they sheathe their weapons and crouch down; otherwise, I can barely, if ever, mount, regardless of what I've done to stun it or where I'm standing. I just don't know what I'm doing differently from everyone else."
