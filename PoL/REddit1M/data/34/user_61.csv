27551,"Rhyme or reason to Blood Moons?

I'm reasonably far through the game (all 4 devine beasts, 60+ shrines, etc), and the Blood Moons are still completely unpredictable.  

I would traditionally think, ""I've already seen the Blood moon this night, so obviously it isn't happening again!"".  Wrong.  

Next, ""it is 3 in the afternoon, obviously no Blood Moon now!"" Incorrect.

Whats the deal?"
