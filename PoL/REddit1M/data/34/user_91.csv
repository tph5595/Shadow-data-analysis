75043,"Today after my 2nd Titan I started trying to kill Lynels and it worked, the easiest ones are the red ones for sure. But damn it takes some time before u know all the timings, in my first fight vs a Silver Lynel I used 6 Max-Durians Meals (which equals like 120+ hearts) and right next to it there was another silver Lynel, lost a HALF heart. Once you know their abilities and when to ""dodge+attack"" dont know the english word for it, its gets a lot easier. And the best part is the loot, I got a FIFTYEIGHT (in numbers 58) damage 1-Hand Sword. Chimera Blade or smth^^

Just try to memorize their moves and its doable mate, hope I could encourage you. (Also take +Def Meals when unsure and new to a lynel, take +Atk when you know his moves)"

75522,"I read online that all the ""good"" boots snow/sand/ and one more sidequest clothing you get in Gerudo Town why is that ? 

I went anticlockwise and Gerudo will be my last destination and that kind made me sad :&lt;"
