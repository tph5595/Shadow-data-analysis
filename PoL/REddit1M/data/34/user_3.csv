453,"There is a certain piece of equipment dropped by a monster in the castle that will probably be helpful to you. There are also loads of good weapons of all types throughout the whole place, and there are lots of guardians to kill if you need more ancient loot. (For the record, though, I'd maybe focus on grabbing up a few dozen more Korok seeds at least)"
762,It will not complete on it's own.
836,"The easiest way I have found to locate Koroks (I'm not going to bother getting all of them so I'm not using a guide) is to look on my map and find every single ""High point"" nearby and hit up each one. 

It is VERY rare that a nearby hill doesn't have at least 1 korok under a damn rock."
7741,"AFAIK you are not able to stasis arrows. You can stasis the large stones that persist when thrown, but not the little rocks that Bokoblins and other enemies throw when they have no other weapons. "
7837,"Something that may not have been mentioned is that you have to have your camera rotated to face the back of the Lynel also. If your camera angle is weird, it will prevent the mount prompt from popping up. Similarly, if you are standing directly in front of a chest, but your camera is rotated so the chest is mostly off the screen, you won't get a prompt to open it. "
22372,"The easiest way is to climb to high places and just look around. 

There is usually at least 1 shrine near each of the large towers that reveal the map. 

Also, use the shrine-seeker thing (Press - and then y if you have turned it off.) to help you zero in on nearby shrines. 

"
22429,I am pretty sure that hitting rocks  and trees and such decreases durability much faster than normal unless the weapon is designed for it (I.e. Iron hammer lasts longer than a soldiers sword.)
22550,It should be noted that you may have to complete a quest before you will be able to buy it from the Gerudo town.
81936,dodge+attack = Counterattack probably.
82050,"It's not weird, they are very rare. I had over 80 shrines done and had already beaten the game before I stumbled onto my first one. Then immediately after I stumbled onto two more. Go figure."
