5606,"I completed the 13 Memories Mission, but didn't receive that letter after it. How do I get it and what can I do with it?"
10153,"They stay where you left them. Either you go to them or you go to any Stable out there and they bring it to you (much easier).

If you get another horse, the last one you left alone will be stored in the Stable, no matter where it is. "
10656,"Within their different spots on the map, Dragons spawn in the Area where you are and they always come to the same time almost each day. Sometimes you have to skip a day or 2, but that's it.

If you wish I can tell you good farming spots for each dragon, including time ðŸ˜‰

Btw, you can only receive one dragon part of a dragon per day. "
10885,"2. No, you cannot stasis animals, including wild horses. Stasis only works with enemies. You even cannot stasis wild animals if they attack you, like bears and wolves."
13458,"I just tried to be sure. Stasis does not work. You can freeze them with ice weapons or arrows, but I was not able to climb on their back when freezed, also they run away in the moment the ice breaks.

When on their back you cannot attack them and you cannot use stasis.

If there's a way I would like to know, too ðŸ˜‰"
13488,Yes
13994,"A yellow/light beam? If yes, that's a star fragment (from a shooting star). They disappear after a while. If you see it next time, hurry and get it. I suggest you highlight it on the map and warp to the nearest shrine."
14376,"What the Amiibo gives you is random, no matter where you are. If you want the full set, then...

save, use Amiibo, open chest. If there's a piece of the set in it, save again, but if not, just reload your last save and do it again until there's a piece of the set inside. You have to do this at least 3 days for the full set with each amiibo. I spent between 3 and 20 minutes per day with each amiibo until a piece of the set appears.

Good luck!"
14998,"Sorry, I meant the 13 photos. I've found all the 13 spots, returned to Impa, heard Zeldas voice and so on...but I did not get that letter. What am I doing wrong?"
15377,Yes. There are 2 locations to obtain that set. One is in Gerudo town.
15647,"Use magnesis on a pillar near him and drive it to his position ðŸ˜‰

You'll find stronger weopons during your progress almost everywhere."
15898,"Go to Floria Lake Bridge, make a Fire and wait till morning. The Dragon comes instantly. He came every day in my game, 10 times in a row. It's a good spot, because he flies under the bridge you're standing ðŸ˜Ž"
16072,"Letter game from the scientist guy? I think I missed something. Tell me more, please. "
18002,"I'm sorry. I misunderstood something. Someone told me he received that letter after ""that photo mission"". I thought he mentioned the 13 photos, not the compendium ðŸ˜³"
19942,"I shot one accidently and it just died. It even did not disappear as other dead animals, it just lied there dead. I felt awful after that and reloaded my game. ðŸ˜©"
20349,"I think everyone hopes for a big screen OoT Remake, but at the moment, Nintendo did not announce that and it could take years until they do. Maybe they'll release it on Virtual Console for the Switch later, but that hasn't been announced also.

Get the 3DS Version. ðŸ˜‰"
20603,Just shoot an ice arrow on him and you can climb him...you need a couple of ice arrows. Or use an ice weapon. 
21029,"I got over it after the reload, seeing it alive and running ðŸ˜‰"
21990,"Without your HUD it's hard to find shrines. Best way still is to climb high and look around.

But it's almost unlikely you find hidden shrines without your HUD and the [Shiekah Sensor](/spoiler)."
66131,"No problem. For the Fire Dragon warp to Hebra Tower. Then go to Pondo's Lodge, a small house close to the Tower northwest. Go inside and rest at fire or in bed till morning. Then walk outside and head straight south until you reach the canyon. The Dragon comes now from northwest. Wait until he flies down in the canyon and then go and get what you need ðŸ˜Ž"
66395,"Just look at your map and zoom all the way in. If there's a seed icon, you already received a seed. ðŸ˜‰"
66588,"For the Ore it's better to hit it with a weapon or hammer, since bombing blows most of its content away."
66887,"I recommend you need to upgrade your Shiekah Sensor to Shiekah Sensor+ in Hateno Insitute. Then it will search for whatever you want, if you have recorded it with a picture in your compendium."
67170,I have 4 pages with armor sets in my inventory and also have all 4 Amiibo Sets and the Sheik Mask. Last entry is the Switch Shirt (bought DLC) and 4 slots are unused on the last page.
68596,"1) No, there is not. But if you wish you can look at this map, which tells their exact position. It also tells other important stuff, so there are Spoilers inside. Use at your own risk: http://www.zeldadungeon.net/breath-of-the-wild-interactive-map/

2) Fight them or ignore them. Do as you like ðŸ˜‰"
70441,"Yes, they respawn. You even do not have to warp away or rest at a fire. Just walk away for a short while from the puzzle area and the block is back at its start location."
81910,"I found a lot of them in Akkala, near the Spring of Power at the Mountains. The Sensor does help. It points the direction you have to climb. Also use stasis if you stand at some point, because that makes the plants better visible."
83321,Nope. You can explore as much you want until you decide to fight Ganon. 
83473,"There are bears in the dueling Peaks Area, and more aggressive bears are in snowy mountains in Gerudo and Hebra."
84196,"Yes. She mentions Eventide Island. The Island in the lower right corner on your map. She wants to get there and the only way is to fly, so she needs ""wings"".

This is actually a hint for you. You can fly, don't you? ðŸ˜‰ So go to a high spot and fly to the Island."
