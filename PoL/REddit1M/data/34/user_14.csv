8248,"There are 120 Sheikah Shrines and 900 hidden Koroks. Both are well-documented on the Zelda wiki. There are also bosses in the wild that you get a medal for defeating, I believe, and there might even be a bonus for discovering certain locations. I know I've noticed several locations that are not named on the map until I reach them.

I think that's about it for completionists. [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/614g3c/spoilers_everything_there_is_to_do_in_botw/) has a pretty comprehensive list, too."
