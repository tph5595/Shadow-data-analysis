1128,"&gt;Guardians are super scary :-( 

Seriously, learning how to parry the beams makes them a joke. Turn on Duruk's Protection, grab some fairies, and go practice on the ones in Hyrule Field. Hold up your shield and hit A just when their eye flashes white. Duruk's Protection will activate if you're off by a little, so you have some wiggle room to get it right. Your goal is to parry without DP activating. Once you have the timing down, the guardians become mere nuisances.

73905,"Climbing everywhere was so much fun for me, I just did stamina at first. You can make food that gives extra hearts if you need it. I think I had 6 or 7 hearts when I maxed stamina."
