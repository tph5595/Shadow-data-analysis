Always be on the lookout, and even if a shrine is really far away, you still have it on your map for later.

Every stable and town has a shrine nearby as well, keep that in mind as you discover new settlements. Shrines also serve as warp points, so every time you get go a new town/stable find the shrine.

There is another method for finding shrines you may find later. But tbh I don't use that way yet. I find I stumble onto plenty just exploring. "
