12661,"From what I can tell, you can't mount a Lynel after using Stasis on it. When the Stasis wears off, the Lynel will go into a ""recovery"" pose (even if you didn't hit it at all) but this is *not* the same kneeling pose that lets you mount it. "
13226,"For the memory, I think the one you're looking for is just west of Mt. Lanayru. There's a T-shaped body of water there named Lanayru Promenade, and the gate is on the road at the eastern tip of the T. 

More generally, you should talk to the painter Pikango in Kakariko, if you haven't done so yet. If you complete a side quest for him, he'll take a look at your memory photos and give you some info about where to find the location. The Lanayru Gate is the first one he gives you, and after that he'll start appearing at various stables around the map, and will tell you about the nearest memory location if there's one in the area."
14046,"&gt; For Raw prime meat there's an NPC (can't remember where) that buys it at 100 rupees each (not sure if you can get more out of it by cooking it with something else though)

I think the NPC you're thinking of is at Outskirt Stable, but he buys Raw Gourmet Meat at 100 rupees apiece, not Prime Meat. 

That said, he'll only buy three pieces per day, and you have to sell them one at a time, going through his conversation each time. So if you're trying to unload a stockpile of meat, it's going to take a long time.

It's far more efficient to just cook five Gourmet Meats together, which produces a dish that sells for 490 rupees at any store. Your profit is reduced by 2 rupees per piece of meat, but the time you save will more than make up for it. "
