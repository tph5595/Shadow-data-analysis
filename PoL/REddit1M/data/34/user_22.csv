11283,"I haven't yet reached anywhere near this point in the game yet, but I was watching some gameplay of someone doing the Yiga hideout which looks really difficult to me because I'm bad at those sorts of missions.  So after he fought the boss, he was able to climb the hill behind the boss and go back into the rest of the map (also during he fight he climbed the hill, went back down to find the fight restarted).  So I'm wondering if it's possible to just go after the Yiga boss from that direction.  To climb down that hill and skip the hideout.  Or will something block it so you have to do the stealth section or the cutscene won't play unless you do the puzzle in the hideout?  Because it would be cool to just get there from behind and skip the hideout if possible."
