You can also enter the basement below and the tower above without triggering a story cut scene.  But there will be a little cut scene as soon as you get over the moat. Even if you trigger the boss, i think you can still either warp out or just restart the app. "

And there is also no Tingle on Tingle island so don't get your hopes up there either."
