63548,Stasis+ **Does Not** let you mount them. Headshotting a Lynel and making it droop does allow you to mount them. *I don't believe you can mount a Lynel while locked on to them.*
63587,"Stasis+ does not put them in the proper crumple to mount them.

You also cannot mount a Lynel while locked on to them (the prompt won't show up)."
63682,Do the medals for defeating all the minibosses actually *do* anything?  I can't find anything online so I'm assuming they are just there to show that I have a penchant for violence.
64079,Royal Weapons are fairly common in Hyrule Castle. I can't say for certain but it feels like enemies in certain places scale up in difficulty as your completion goes up and I find that Hinoxes tend to have royal weapons on their necklaces. There is a skull looking lake in the top right zone. If you teleport to the shrine there you can paraglide on top of the Hinox and steal his stuff and just scamper away.
64134,I think Rain is very common in certain zones (specifically the tropic area in the south-east). As far as weather goes I rather like Rain so long as I wasn't trying to climb anywhere.
64238,Maybe I was just unlucky but I wouldn't recommend stasis+ because half the times I tried it they immediately noticed me as soon as it ended.
64403,Both of those runes are amazing during most fights! Stasis can be upgraded to work on enemies and smashing giant metal objects into enemies does pretty high damage without having to worry about your weapons.
64483,You can temporarily extinguish it with an ice arrow. Presumably icy chu jelly would work as well.
64742,"Ganon is at the very top of Hyrule Castle. It is marked on the map if you enter and I think you might even be able to tell looking at it from a distance. Either way as long as you don't enter that specific room you will not trigger him.
"
64780,If you zone out and back in it should probably respawn. I can't say 100% but I know explosive barrels and crates respawn if you enter and exit a shrine.
64837,The vast majority of armor is bought at shops. Check every town you visit! The few remaining sets are found in shrines or received from quests.
101329,"Yeah. You get medals for defeating every Hinox, every Moldoga, and every Talus. I just got one of them but I think they are just for show."
