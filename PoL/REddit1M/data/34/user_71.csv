33743,"People who have gotten all armor sets, are you left with 4 empty slots on your final page of armor? I'm wanting to make sure I retrieved every piece. I also used all the amiibo. After everything I have 4 empty slots which is great, no biggie, but I wanted to verify with other players who have obtained all gear that that's what their inventory looks like as well."
