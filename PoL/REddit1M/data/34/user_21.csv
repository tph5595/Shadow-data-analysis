11145,"Is there any list of what's the best you can get for each item?

Like:

For rubies, after you are done with Vah Rudania, there's a Gerudo female in Goron city that buys packs of 10 from you at a higher price than stores.

For Raw ~~prime~~ Gourment Meat there's an NPC on Outskirk stable that buys it at 100 rupees each

I compiled a list with all I'm gonna need for the remaining armor upgrades so I'd like to sell the rest and get the most out of it and hopefully spend it in some of the stuff I'm missing"
14937,"I wasn't sure of the location, couldn't check it and didn't want to mislead anyone.. but it turns out it is where I thought except it doesn't but what I thought xD thanks, will edit.

That's a better option then, thank you. I only have 10 pieces of that but I don't want to spend 4 days and 10 conversations to sell them :P This is why I want such a list :P "
15320,"I wasn't sure either, turns out it was at Outskirt stable"
43136,"Where can I get Swift Violet? I need 55 more than I have for pending armor upgrades but I haven't come by too many of them. edit: I found a 5 or 6 around the waterfall near twin peaks stable and I bought 4 in Zora's domain but.. how long do they take to respawn?

Also any other options for Hightail Lizard other than cutting grass or purchasing a few from Beedle from time to time?"
81065,"Yeah, that's what I did for other items such as hearty blueshell snail but unfortunately the swift violet grows in vertical surfaces and the sensor is not of much use."
