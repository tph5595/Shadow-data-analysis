12690,you can freeze horses to tame them though!
14361,"no, you cant climb on them while they are frozen but you can stand next to your new fancy ice sculpture and mash the ""A"" button until they unfreeze and get on them that way. it has worked for me every time. the only other mount i tried it on was the lord of the mountain and that did not work at all."
