116,"Should I do Hyrule Castle now? Is there anything there that will make post-game easier?

Here's my progress:

* 70 shrines

* 30 Korok seeds

* 2.4 Stamina wheels, One row of hearts plus 2 on the second row

* Level 3 Hylian armor, fully upgraded Ancient helm

* 4 Divine beasts complete

* All memories acquired (except for one in Hyrule castle)

Guardians are super scary :-("

Good tip!"
640,"So after getting the final memory, I have to complete the quest by speaking to Impa? It won't just complete on its own?"
4490,"Questions about Stasis+:

1. Can you stasis projectiles like arrows or stones?

2. I will try this later, but can you stasis wild horses?"
