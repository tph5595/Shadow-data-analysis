27265,"About the Blood Moon :

Sometimes I have blood Moon between 4 and 6 am. The animation is really fast and I don't have the creepy music. This time I was looking for an Dinraal. I go to the Tabatha Great Bridge and wait for it. It comes, I'm about to jump to shot its horn, 7 pm unexpected Blood Moon. At the end of the animation the Dinraal was gone. It really pissed me off and I don't know if it's a bug or it's just normal stuff like Yigas spawning randomly everywhere. I thought the blood Moon happens around 11 pm normally. So is it a bug of the game or normal stuff if you have completed the game once ? 

Edit : After that I went to sleep and I had the Blood Moon animation again. Fun fact, as I was pissed off I started to cut the air with my sword and realised you don't have to hold Y to do a circular attack, you can do a circle with your D-pad while pressing Y. 

Edit 2 : Guys I think I found a glitch, the same thing happened again. Go to Tabatha Great Bridge around 7 pm and tell me if the Blood Moon happens."
