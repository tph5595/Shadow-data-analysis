8613,Is that how that works?  I feel like such a dipshit.  Fighting Ganon I kept trying to time my Master Sword swings with the shots hoping to knock it back like in LttP.  
8818,"Finished the game and now just having a blast doing side quests and upgrading armor sets.  Regarding the dragon horns, do they normally move from one spawn location to another after I get some materials from them?  I got a scale and tooth off of Farosh and now he is no longer at Lake Hylia.  Did he move to his Faron Falls location now? I got him to spawn like a half dozen times at Lake Hylia and engaged him several times, but now he no longer spawns at Lake Hylia at midnight.  Can I expect this to be the case for other dragons, that once you farm them a couple of times, they change their spawn point to a different location?"
8862,"1. No.

2. Great question.  Let us know what you discover. "
18165,"Good information to know.  I have gotten what I need out of Farosh and Naydra.  It seems like I can farm them for two consecutive days and after getting one item each day, they seem to bounce to their secondary spawn point.  "
18232,Do I need the three piece flamebreaker set bonus in order to be able to climb the magma golem dude and defeat him?  
18669,"Really? Just to be clear, I am talking about the stone talus world boss that is covered in magma, not the divine beast that is shaped like a salamander.  "
