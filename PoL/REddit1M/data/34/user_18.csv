9793,"If you abandon your horse, will it find it's way back to the stable? I remember a week ago I was riding my horse and decided to get off to climb a mountain, after which I went to bed. I got another horse and left it in the woods somewhere after turning it off, but it was right where I left it when I came back. So do they find their way back?"
