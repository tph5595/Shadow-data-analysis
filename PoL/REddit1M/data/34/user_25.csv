12285,"I feel like *where* you use the Amiibo affects drop rates.  For example, for the past week I've been using the BotW Zelda, 8-bit Link, and OoT Link Amiibos to get extra loot and (hopefully) the unique tunics.

Usually I'd use these out in the field whenever I'd remember to.  Mostly it would spit out some piddly stuff like arrows and maybe a knight shield at best.

For kicks I decided to try out the Amiibo in Hyrule Castle just because that's where I was at the time.  On the first try I get the Tunic of the Hero and the Trousers of Time!  I had been using the Amiibo for days prior with the same crap, and now in Hyrule Castle I get the good stuff!!

Can anyone confirm or was this just random luck?"
