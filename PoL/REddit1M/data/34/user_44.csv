17296,"I got my Switch on Wednesday, and I've played BotW for about 5 hours. Once I got off the Plateau, I chose to turn off the HUD and I know I'll enjoy the game more this way. 

This means I'm super lost, which is awesome. But I haven't really been finding any shrines. I only have 4 hearts, and I can tell that I need more, preferably soon. What tips are there for finding shrines that aren't straight up spoilers?"
