3320,There's a stone tablet with three holes in the ground for the orbs pretty much in the middle of the 3 Hinoxes; the skeletons they are napping under are visible on the map so throw a waypoint vaguely in the middle and go for it. It's up a hill from where the Hinoxes are. You have to read the tablet before putting the orbs in or they won't count.
