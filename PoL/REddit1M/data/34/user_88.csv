62428,Why doesn't this korok give me a seed? Am I supposed to do something else? https://imgur.com/gallery/rU76P
64524,Hmm. Maybe I've already received the seed. I don't remember being here before though. 
64922,Do you focus on upgrade solely hearts/solely stamina or a combo of both early game? I've upgraded my heart one time and none on my stamina. Wondering if I should do another heart rn or balance it out and do stamina.
