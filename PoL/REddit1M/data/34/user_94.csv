83278,"So I found a Vai named **Flavi** just outside of Lurelin Village (Between Tuft Mountain and the Palmorae Ruins shrines in the South-East) that wishes to have wings. Every time I talk to her she just says ""If only I had wings"". Not sure what to do here and can't find anything else online about it.

Anyone know what to do here?"

83441,Unlucky. The quests to get them are a little annoying =)
83601,What minbosses do you mean? Things like Hinox etc?
83686,The restless crickets are from a side quest. You will only need 10 however.

Been there a few days ago by mistake not knowing what I was in for. Does she not reward you for something? I was hoping we could give or make wings for something else"
