They're both good in their own way, and I have my favourites in each."

So far I've chalked it up to me being wonky with it, rather than it being bad controls."

So when I'm talking Zelda, I tend to refer to the console games and the handheld games separately because a handheld game (for me) can't possibly provide the same experience as a console game."
