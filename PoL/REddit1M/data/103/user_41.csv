11762,"Twilight Princess. Although I don't remember much from the game, I remember it being one of my favorites. Probably the whole dark atmosphere the game had. That was sort of my teenage lifestyle at the time. 

Looking forward to playing it again in HD, but I'm just worried I may not like it as much as I used to. "
