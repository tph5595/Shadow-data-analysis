10796,"I'll preface by saying MM is my personal favorite, but I still think that OoT is the best built 3D Zelda.  
  
Wind Waker falls victim to the same problem every 3D Zelda after OoT had: it took many different risks that either paid off in full, crashed down in disaster, or is very split on whether people actually liked it or not. Pretty much, it did a lot of good (beautiful art style, music style, good progression of combat), and bad (sailing, number of dungeons). And some people will disagree saying they don't like the art style, or that they liked the way sailing was in the original.  
  
That's just the inherent effect of taking risks with Zelda games. For some people it pays off (like MM and SS did for me). While for others it doesn't quite just do it (TP was that, in my opinion).  
  
The only exception is OoT. Only recently have people started to complain about certain aspects of OoT, but even then the complaints have been a bit baseless. The way I see it, OoT is not the best at anything: doesn't have as good an atmosphere as MM, doesn't have as good an overworld as WW, doesn't have as good music (imo) as TP, doesn't have as good story and dungeons as SS, etc. But it is does all those things very well, which why I say it's the best Zelda, even though I personally prefer MM more."
