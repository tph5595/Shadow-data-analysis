44097,"I enjoyed windwaker, but Majoras Mask stays my favorite for three reasons. 
1. I like the darker tone

2. I like that it strayed from the typical Zelda formula

3. This may seem kind of weird, but I can relate to Skull kid. I know what it's like to not have friends, and that longing for a relationship.
