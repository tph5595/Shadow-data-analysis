54216,"I respectfully disagree. To me it's way too short, way too few dungeons and the ones that are in there are not super memorable. At all. They clearly cut out a dungeon around the Jabun section of the game, and then also cut down the Ice Isle and Fire Isle to be quick 10 min mini-dungeons. And then the triforce shards quest has to be one of the worst ending quests to a Zelda game ever. So tedious and obnoxious. I'll give it to you, great soundtrack and atmosphere but nowhere near the best. Maybe top 10."
