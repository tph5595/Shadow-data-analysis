6988,"I *love* me some Wind Waker, but this:

&gt;I think it truly captures the essence of Zelda a little better than MM, TP, and SS.

is very questionable. Twilight Princess to me was actually more true to old school Zelda than even Ocarina. Of the four you mentioned, I'd actually say Windwaker is the *least* true to form of an essential Zelda game.

Not that that's a bad thing. It got all sorts of crap when it was released for that, but it turned out to be an amazing game. And from a lore standpoint, it did feel like a Hyrule Waterworld to me, so mission accomplished."
