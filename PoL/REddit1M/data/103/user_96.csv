Not to mention the Credits theme, I could listen to that all day. I wish they featured the 3 Goddesses' themes more, I loved them all but we only get to hear them twice if you count Link playing them on his harp to open the Silent Realms."

39013,"Too easy, too short, too irreverential. It would have been a smash hit if it had been released as a handheld Zelda, but as a mainline home console Zelda it can't stand up to the likes of LttP, OoT, TP, and SS. I put 30hrs into WW compared to 60+ for the others. And it probably would have been closer to 20-25 without the tedious Triforce collection (fuck Tingle)."
40351,"Nayru's Pearl was clearly supposed to have it's own dungeon, not just talking to Jabun. Greatfish Isle likely would have been it's location.

Fire Mountain and Ice Ring Isle were probably supposed to have post-Master Sword dungeons like the Earth and Wind Temples, instead they got turned into minigame like timed obstacle courses.

As for the Triforce collection, I don't think they were ever supposed to be in dungeons, or even ever supposed to be in the game. Personally I think the devs just put it in since they didn't have enough time to finish actual dungeons and needed to pad the game more."
92267,"Hmm, maybe because all you had to do was Thrust once to make moblins (who make up like 50% of the enemy mobs in the game btw) drop their weapon, hop around grabbing their ass in pain, leaving themselves defenseless so you can use them as punching bags? Or should I mention the Darknuts that all follow the same easy Counter -&gt; Mash B to death strategy? When TP throws 2 Darknuts at you, you know you're in for some real shit. WW? Throw 4 or 5 Darknuts and it almost, ALMOST feels like a challenge. 

As for the artstyle. Go ask how seriously the gundam fanbase takes the SD spinoff line. Yeah."
95264,"Not even close. TP never handed you a main quest item just for talking to some NPCs, playing a rope swinging minigame, and then chucking some bombs. Or a main dungeon item just for showing up at the front door."
95957,"? You'll have to refresh my memory. Anyway it's not like WW had good bosses. Rehashed Bongo Bongo with none of the eerie atmosphere. Rehashed Barinade. I don't even know what that fat ghost thing is supposed to be, but it sure ain't intimidating. "

I didn't like Stallord, it felt very forced, like they shoehorned a way to use the Spinner in. Blizzeta I loved though. Fyrus too, I thought it was cool yanking his chain (punny!) while wearing the Iron boots to pull him down (similar to Argorok). Also mashing Armogohma with the giant statues and bomb-arrowing her once she splits up into tons of tiny spiders. Morpheel I honestly don't remember much, didn't leave an impression, so yeah probably was one of the easier ones. I haven't played TP in a while, waiting for HD's release."
98333,"&gt; Regarding the combat, it's some of the most responsive and fluidly animated action I've ever played in a video game. It's simple, but not shallow by any means. It's tons of fun. There are so many ways to attack the enemies, whether you want to use your sword, incapacitate them with your tools, or even use their own tools against them. Or you can make them attack each other if you jump out of the way in time.

None of which has to do with difficulty. In fact some of that (disarming them, making them hit each other) makes it even easier than it already is.

&gt;The most shallow combat in a 3D Zelda game is easily TP's wolf combat.

That we agree on. Though arbiters grounds did Wolf form right, just not enough of that and too much tear collecting."
