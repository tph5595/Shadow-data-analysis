48367,"I disagree. Just because you're looking for pieces of the triforce, doesn't mean the game is similar. In the original game on the NES, you were exploring dungeons and looking for hidden secrets for triforce pieces. In Wind Waker, you're mostly just saving up thousands of rupees to get your charts translated, then just sailing to wherever it tells you to. Not too similar"
