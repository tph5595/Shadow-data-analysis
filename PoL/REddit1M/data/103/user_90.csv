31351,"Zelda is probably the highest quality game series ever made with a decent volume of games (though Metal Gear comes very close) so there isn't a bad one out there. WW was good fun, but I never felt the ""hook"" so to speak. I think I was frustrated with the feeling of reward in the puzzles or dungeons; solve this puzzle? Here's some rupees. Discovered a secret island? Rupees. That treasures chest you can see but can't reach? Yeah it's filled with rupees.I get that's par for the course, but it just felt like that was the only thing hiding in those boxes and was kind of disillusioned after a while. Skyward is my favorite, so take my opinion for what it's worth"
