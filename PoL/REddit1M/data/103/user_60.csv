19998,"Personally Windwaker only usurped Majora's Mask in my books when I played the HD remaster where they tweaked the later part of the game and added in some stuff like the fast sail etc. That being said, I haven't played Majora's Mask 3D yet so it may well end up with the two of them as a tie. 

Personally, I think Skyward Sword had the potential to be the best of all the games but with Fi interupting you every 5 seconds telling you just picked up an item you already have 150 of in your bag it was just way too hand-holdy. I didn't mind the reusing of areas, I thought it was cool that the world changed throughout the game. I disliked the design of the octopus hair cyclops boss (he looked like a rejected Monsters Inc character) and the one boss you have to fight 3 different times, he looked dumb and was awkward to fight. 

But man, the story and characters in Skyward Sword blew me away. I was so happy Zelda was actually a real character in the game who had an impact on the story other than being kidnapped. It totally flipped the typical damsel in distress trope on its head. Here's hoping they've learned from those mistakes and they just blow us away later this year with Zelda U."
