A game should not be a chore. When I played through WWHD I dreaded going back cause of how tedious I found the triforce alongside several of the dungeons. I powered through it cause I wanted to finish it but oh boy did the game make it a difficult for me. 

I think the command melody was one of the most tedious gimmicks in any of the 3D Zeldas. It just took so much time playing the melody again and again in both dungeons. I didn't find the puzzles with the command melody complex or difficult, just tedious because of how many times you had to replay the song for a single puzzle. If they would have made it an item instead with immediate transitions it would have been okay. Towards the end of both dungeons I was so relieved that I didn't have to play the command melody anymore. The HD remaster made it less tedious but didn't fix it well enough.

Wind Waker is my least favorite Zelda 3D game."

The only dungeon I remember in any other 3D Zelda you had to repeat the same song over and over again was Stone Tower but with the Ocarina you could determine the pace yourself and if you got good at it you could get the song over with in no time. All these factors together these sections still took a fraction of the time compared to the time it took to play the command melody. You had to repeat the same song yes but it never got to Command Melody levels of tedium."
