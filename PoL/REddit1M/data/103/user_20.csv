6813,"I've played every Zelda game there has ever been.  Given my age I got to play them as they came out and when they were the most relevant to the gaming industry.  WW is my least favorite game.  It was the first Zelda game they gave us that reduce explorations to a handful of islands.  Like MM it also lacked enough dungeons to make the game a truly expansive game. I did not care for the cartoon-like graphics.  Several months before WW came out Nintendo had a tech demo that showcased a Link/Ganon battle with the most amazing Graphics I had ever seen.  After that day, months went by with little details about the then new Zelda title.  Then they released images of a cell shaded Zelda game.  It just felt like we were robbed of a great game.  WW is an okay game.  Again, I've played them all.  WW is no exception, I've played and collected every item to 100% completion several times.  From my view it's certainly not the best they have ever done.  I can only hope Zelda WII U will be a great Zelda experience.  "
