4630,"Wind Waker was my favorite since it came out, but Skyward Sword usurped it (not easily).  Wind Waker's exploration is fantastic, the world feels huge, the depth of sidequests is insane, and thematically, the game's story is stupendous.

The only thing I can complain about when it comes to Wind Waker is how trivial the combat is.  But the puzzles are still decently challenging, so that makes up for it.

I also vastly prefer the SD version for the original Triforce quest (and the fact that the Tingle statues are actually feasible to obtain without a guidebook).

The reason Skyward Sword defeated it is a combination of Skyward Sword providing my favorite aesthetics in the series, the best story in the series, many of my favorite dungeons in the series (those being the Sandship, Sky Keep, and Ancient Cistern, though a few others are ranked pretty high as well), and the fantastic swordplay."

101790,"I never flicked my wrist - I do full-arm, methodical movements.  I've had situations where I've accidentally swung too hard and done an unintentional spin-attack, but to be honest, it sounds like you were flailing a lot and making very wild, jerky movements.

Fun fact that might help you in the future: the Wii Remote reads ""stopping"" movement better than ""starting"" movement.  So, if you want to prepare a left-swing by moving to the right, your right-movement should be softer, and the left-swing harder."
