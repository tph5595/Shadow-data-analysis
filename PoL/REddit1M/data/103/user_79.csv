26152,"It definitely found its way near the top of my list... which was unexpected the first time I played it because I was put off by the cartoonish graphical style like so many others, but it really grew on me!  And the game was super fun to play... plus [I especially loved the take on an ancient Hyrule lost beneath the ocean!](/spoiler)"
26385,"Fuck yes! The music in WW is *superb!*  So much of what makes Zelda games incredible is their soundtrack. I'm happy the franchise hasn't lost that.  I think WW is for sure my favorite soundtrack in any Zelda game, with TP coming in second."
28174,"I remember that teaser as well and the disappointment that followed... but unlike you, I have not played every single game released (mostly lacking the mobile titles), and over time the Wind Waker's cell-shaded graphics really started to grow on me.  It may have less overall territory to explore... and no Zelda title is without its flaws, but regardless... through charm, story, and soundtrack it still managed to work its way up near the top of my list."
28253,"Hmm, so another in-betweener like TP huh?  We'll see how that works out for them!"
28325,I've yet to find the Zelda game (at least among the 3D titles) where rupees are hard to obtain... you just have to know where to look!
28672,"It is true, there wasn't really anything worthwhile to do in the sky except make a b-line straight to your next objective and then back to Skyloft... the ground was the far more interesting part of that game to be sure.  The only reason additional islands even *existed* in the sky was to make a place for those special boxes to appear once you unlocked them on the ground, otherwise there was no point in visiting any of them.  At least on the ocean there were little hidden spots to find on occasion with pirate platforms, submarines, and giant squid!"
29430,"Just for the record, the flying in Skyward Sword is not *at all* like the leaf gliding in Wind Waker... it is more akin to sailing in your boat or riding Epona.  Plus, Wind Waker was actually not the first (or only) game to introduce a gliding mechanic like that either! It appeared first in Majora's Mask when you hop out of a flower as Deku Scrub Link and float with your spinning flower petals.  Basically it was the exact same mechanic only it wasn't dependent on magic in MM like it was in WW, but rather based on specific locations where you could find a flower to burrow into (also similar to the flower buds Link hops into for a boost upward in WW).

I also have to agree that Wind Waker's soundtrack was among the best in any Zelda title I've played... it really made the game work for me!  The cartoonish graphics grew on me too eventually."

I can get behind everything you said except this... the sword combat in that game was so frustrating for me that I'll probably never 100% the game or re-play it again.  1:1 motion controls was such an exciting idea, but so poorly executed... :("
30344,"&gt; The game even gives the player years to adapt to them before testing them in boss fights.

That is assuming the player can adapt to them at all... this was not the case for me apparently.  I kept feeling like 1:1 sword control was encouraging me to swing my arm at enemies while standing in the middle of my living room, but alas, that only made me do dozens of accidental sword spins, draining my stamina to zero and making me vulnerable to every enemy attack throughout the entire game.  What, can I ask, is the point of 1:1 motion controls ***at all*** if you are expected to simply sit on your couch and carefully flick your wrist?  That's not sword combat!

I wanted to love SS *so much*... but the frustration I felt from being unable to adapt to the controls was the worst kind of frustration a video game can provide.  I am happy you found it to be a non-issue!  My younger brother is also in that camp... but for me and I assume many others, it was a poor choice that will likely prevent me from ever re-playing the game again."
101137,"Well, in short, 1:1 controls seemed to be encouraging me to behave like I was holding a sword and shield... right?  I mean correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't see *any* other reason to build the controls like that.

Well the only problem with that is that the wii motion+ was far too sensitive for swinging my whole arm.  Every time I tried to do one of those special directional attacks that basically *every* enemy required to be defeated, repositioning the wiimote so I could swing in the correct direction registered an extra swing just from getting it ready for the actual swing, which obviously the target then deflected and counterattacks.

Plus, if that isn't enough, half the time I tried to swing it would also activate a spin attack for some reason!  Even though I was not trying to move my shield hand at all... again I think it was too sensitive and the motion was just traveling across my body from my opposite arm moving.  So, in essence, half the time I was frantically trying to engage my enemies, I would immediately exhaust myself with spin attacks accidentally and then walk around for five seconds helpless and defenseless... *incredibly* frustrating.  This mechanic ended up making the boss battles (all of them) in SS the most difficult bosses I have faced in *any* Zelda game to date, with the Imprisoned being the absolute worst in terms of stress.  I *dreaded* that battle, and for good reason... the game makes you do it THREE times!!

So here's the thing about Skyward Sword... I don't doubt that with the correct strategy, it may be possible to get a handle on these motion controls, after all I saw my own brother do it.  Apparently he didn't have the same issues that I did either.  In the end, I think making a game that treats the wiimote as the handle of your sword as you move it around your body *totally* encouraged a type of gameplay that *did not work* for actually playing the game.  The way my brother described it to me, you have to make careful wrist flicks or some crap in order to use the controls effectively.  Let me ask this then:  *What is the point of making 1:1 sword control in the first place if all you are supposed to do is gently flick your wrist??*  It makes no sense to me, and that is NOT how you use a sword in real life.  If they can't get 1:1 controls to work the way they *feel* like they should work, then they should not have done it at all.  It was an experiment that, in my opinion, failed.  Maybe it would have helped if there was some kind of sensitivity adjustment on the motion controls, but alas there is not.

I still managed to get all the way through the game despite the added difficulty... but it was such a difficult and infuriating experience that I don't really care to repeat it anytime soon.  Plus there was no way I was ever going to be able to get the Hylian shield with how insanely hard the boss battles were for me, so I blew that side-quest off also, much to my own dismay, having completed every other Zelda title I've played to 100%.

Indeed this is something I realized fairly early on... but it is not at all easy to execute every time when the enemy only gives you a split second to react before changing direction.  Allowing my swing to slow down enough to not trigger before I wanted it to usually meant missing the window of opportunity, which probably led to my jerking it a little too fast 50% of the time in an effort to get my swing in before the enemy changed their block direction.

Perhaps wild jerky movements are all I am capable of?  Believe me, I had plenty of practice at it by the time I got to the final boss... but none of it seemed to help.  When buttons are involved, I can play just fine and even though I still make a few mistakes sometimes it seems to be a lot more forgiving in that sense, but for motion controls my ""jerkiness"" simply means I can't play effectively... which is sad and unfortunate.  I'd **love** to try and re-play skyward sword with buttons for everything *except* swinging the sword, and see if that helps at all... at least that would solve the stamina draining problem I kept having... but again, such things are sadly not possible.

This game had such a wonderful story and atmosphere (except for that *terrifying* silent zone) that I truly **would** want to give it another chance... but frustration of feeling like the game is actively working against you to make your job harder the whole time is one of the worst kind of frustrations to feel."
