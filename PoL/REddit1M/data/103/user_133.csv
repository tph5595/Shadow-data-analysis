74211,"I got into the Zelda business with the handheld titles, beginning with minish cap and then, when the ds came out, Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks. I loved both of these games very much. It was only later that I got a GameCube and twilight princess where I'm not even close to playing it through. I always wanted to try windwaker but never got the chance. But from what I've heard and seen it really is the best one. Gigantic world, a million things to discover and collect. Also the beautiful graphics. I really need to get that game soon"
