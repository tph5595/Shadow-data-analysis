&amp;nbsp;

-OOT: The very first videogame I played was OOT, so it's very special to me in many ways. I don't think I need to go into much detail of why OOT is an amazing classic, we all know why.

-Twilight Princes: The whole twilight / dark aspect didn't completely do it for me, but I still had a blast with the world and dungeons (favorite were arbiter's grounds and snowpeak ruins). Also, I had this for Wii, and I'm not that into gimmicky motion controls. Do I even need to mention collecting tears..? Otherwise, fantastic game.

-Skyward Sword: Again, not into gimmicky motion controls. I loved the more happy tone than twilight princess, but in the later parts it seemed to drag on a little. The timeshift mechanic was really cool imo.

-Majora's Mask: Only got around to playing this recently. Great game, but just seemed like a less enjoyable / polished OOT.

-Wind Waker: From the happy, cartoon theme, to the top tier sound track, this is my all time favorite Zelda. I think it truly captures the essence of Zelda a little better than MM, TP, and SS. My only issue with the game is that there weren't any vast lands or areas to explore like OOT and TP.

&amp;nbsp;

Anyways, who else has Wind Waker as their favorite? Or has another one of these games as their favorite and appeals to some of the things I didn't like as much? Have a great day /r/zelda! :)"
