77940,That's what killed MM for me.  I just never really felt like I was accomplishing anything.
78141,"I really do like Skyward Sword a lot - the highs are fantastic, but the lows are really frustrating.  By the end of it, the game had checked off nearly every lazy RPG trope out there.  Forced stealth, escort, powerless section, fighting the same boss multiple times, pointless fetch quests, etc.  There's a lot of padding near the end that just seems like an obstacle.  

It's good, but it was better for me the first time that I played it."

The second time I played it was on the Wii U with the Wii Motion+ built in, and I had significantly bigger problems.  I was missing strikes all the time and had serious troubles jabbing.  Maybe my skills devolved over four years, but it was more difficult for sure.  Same thing with the rickety coaster - finished it on my second attempt the first time I played it, but the second time I played it, it took me way longer."
78457,"I wasn't a fan of WW, but I do totally understand why people liked it.  It just didn't mesh well for me.  People say that the sailing was better once you got the Swift Sail, but even then, I didn't like the fact that I had to constantly go back to the auction to see if it was there.

I'm happy that it exists and I'm happy that people like it, but it just wasn't for me."
