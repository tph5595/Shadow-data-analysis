There are moments in WW when you have to fight against the wind and make it to nearby islands, and it kind of sucks, but that just makes it so much more enjoyable when you do start to find the few different ways to open up the world, suddenly it's pretty amazing, and so much exploring to do. The first time you set those sails into a full back wind and are headed full speed toward an island, you will forgive the game for all the trials and tribulations it put you through!

Also I want to say some of the logic and complications that arise out of the command melody, are the most challenging and complex puzzles in all of Zelda, in my opinion. The command melody was really cool."
19996,"When I first played WW directly after having finished OoT, the graphics were off-putting to me, and I hated the idea of being stuck on an island with this goofy family, cutting grass, it just seemed like a non-legit zelda title to me. I read some negative reviews online, and that was the nail in the coffin for a little while, I put the game off for a few months. When I did come back to it, and started to go further I was so glad I did, because it's so much more serious than I ever expected, and in the end it's a much different game than OoT, but in it's own way I like it just as much, and would give it a more or less perfect score.

Yes I realize a zelda purist would think the graphics and childlike themes are a little cheesy, and I agreed at first, but in reality it just makes it that much more creepy when you get deeper in the game and realize this shit is hardcore. It's like when the smiling clown turns out to be a serial killer and it's the scariest shit you've ever seen. Some of the more remote islands with the attack birds, are just so desolate and windswept, you just feel like you've been stranded on a shipwreck. It really puts you in the moment and can be a frightening experience, especially early on when you can't travel very far, that feeling of being stuck on an island is a powerful fear. You can tell the King of Red Lions has seen some shit too, he's a badass dude with a story to tell.

Some of the gameplay is really amazing too. When you really figure out the deku leaf, you suddenly can fly. When hating on WW, everybody focuses on the gameplay of sailing, (which I thought was pretty realistic and awesome but I can see people's complaints) but nobody mentions that WW is basically the only zelda where you can fly as a major portion in the game (I think? I've never played skyward sword and hear there is some sort of flying in that). The gameplay for WW is very diverse, and so much fun. The only thing the gameplay is missing is Epona, then it would have everything.

And the conduction of melodies is better with the baton, than with the ocarina, this is one place where it's pretty obvious the game designers improved on OoT. The baton does more complicated songs, it's controls are more complex yet never hard to use, and has some great melodies that at least rival the iconic melodies created with the ocarina. In that aspect I think the music in WW is spot-on, it's never going to be as memorable as OoT for music (partially because we all played that game first and have a soft spot in our hearts for it), but I don't think you can seriously say the music of WW was a let-down, it is one of the strongest aspects of the game, possibly minus some cheesy childhood songs early-on, which I think were done purposefully to create a mood of peacefulness and childhood bliss.

Also some of the commands just really added complexity and a uniqueness to this game that puts it in a category of its own for zelda titles. You can do so much with the wind and command melodies, it makes for some uniquely challenging puzzles, and lets you physically get to certain areas of islands, that seem completely impossible based on what we are used to in other zelda games. So much more player control and possibilities in WW.

You are going to be hard-pressed to find many people who put WW squarely ahead of OoT and a few other iconic zelda titles, but I personally think it is just as amazing, albeit a bit different theme, and yes that sailing can be hard work at times, but isn't every zelda game when you are just starting off? I can't count the number of times I've had to run all the way across hyrule in OoT to explore some shit back in the Kokiri Forest, or up in Goron City. Or being stuck, not realizing how to advance, this theme goes back all the way to the original NES version.

OoT perfect 10/10 - Zelda II AoL perfect 10/10 - Twilight Princess perfect 10/10 - I would put WW in same category 10/10. They all have flaws none of them are perfect, but they all captured our imagination in some kind of unique and profound way."
27732,"The triforce was a hassle, but I didn't have nearly as many problems as what some people are reporting. Not sure why it was such a big deal. Part of the game is that you have to do a lot of exploratory searching for sunken treasures, if you timed it all right, you could do that over time fairly easily when you were exploring islands, and wouldn't need to do it all at once.

As far as the command melody taking time, I don't get that argument. All of the melodies take time. It gets annoying to play the ocarina over and over again too. That's any game. We would all be subscribing to the Halo sub if we wanted straight-forward titles with simpler gameplay, that don't challenge us intellectually. Zelda titles can be hair-pullingly frustrating at times, but the payoff is normally amazing, and the gameplay is fun and unique, so that's what makes them great."
