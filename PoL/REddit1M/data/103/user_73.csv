23914,"Getting the Ballad of Gales* really opened up the game for me in my first play through. I forget exactly when I got it, but I remember being very linear in the game, and only focusing on tasks that were in my immediate vicinity because I really didn't want to make some of the longer sailing trips. Once I got the Ballad of Gales the sailing portion of the game was greatly reduced, and I felt free to explore all of the different islands and do some of the tasks that required me to travel across the world. I sort of liked the way it worked out in WW, solely because of how much it changed the game for me.

Edit, originally I had confused the Requiem of Wind with Ballad of Gales, so I changed the song."
