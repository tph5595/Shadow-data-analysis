12621,Agreed. WW has been my favorite since it came out on GC. I have part of the intro tattooed on my arm

Most of them look really cool, but I didn't want something that was too obvious (even though I did include the Triforce and the Pearls of the Goddesses). I picked the intro for WW because it's my favorite in the series, and the intro itself is what really pulled me into the lore of the world, when I was younger. That was the first LoZ game that I played through to the finish multiple times, and it made me go back and finish out all the other ones haha."
92956,Thank you!
92990,Thank you! Ya I brainstormed for a long time before deciding on what I liked
93007,That's awesome!
105818,"That depends, honestly. I love them all haha, but I'd say my top three are probably WW, Ocarina, and Twilight Princess. Runners up would be A Link to the Past and Skyward Sword"
106727,"I love it. The gameplay is unique and the story imo is fantastic. Dungeons are really well crafted and outside of a couple silly boss fights, the bosses were really well done and memorable. The sword fighting does get tiring though because it's with the Wii controller, but it's miles better than the Twilight Princess Wii port. "
