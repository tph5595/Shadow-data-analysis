42317,"It's my second favorite. I love sailing around, the locations, the music, the art design, almost everything about it. I'd say it would be my favorite if the dungeons in it were more interesting. I just find them... unmemorable, and dungeons are important to me for Zelda games.

So Twilight Princess wins it for me.

My personal ranking (for the 3D Zelda games)

1. Twilight Princess
2. Windwaker
3. Ocarina of Time
4. Skyward Sword (still playing this one)
5. Majora's Mask"
