451575,"Absolutely. Wind Waker was THE defining video game of my whole childhood. The graphics blew me away as a 9 year old kid back in 2003, and they still do today. Love absolutely everything about WW. 

1.WInd Waker
2. Twilight Princess
3.Skyward Sword (just got it for Christmas, need to play more to determine if its equal or better than TP, but its really good so far.)
4.Ocarina of Time 3D (Never owned an N64 as a kid, but superb game all around.
5. Four Swords Adventures. "
