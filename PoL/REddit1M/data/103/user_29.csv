9236,"To be fair, we're creeping up on 10 years of TP. I think a decade is long enough to justify nostalgia."
11014,"&gt;Anyone else who puts Wind Waker as their favorite main Zelda title?

It's definitely up there for me. It will always have a special place in my heart, since I played it through junior high when I had no friends and my parents got divorced. WW is a perfect escape â€“ almost an island getaway. If I was Huck Finn, WW was my Mississippi.

That being said, with the benefit of hindsight, WW has a lot of shortcomings. We're all familiar with the tedium of sailing, and the cramped feel of the islands, and the shallow combat, and the weak art style, and too few dungeons, and so on, and so on, so I won't get into them. I will say, however, that with the exception of the first couple islands, WW gives you more freedom to explore than most other Zeldas, which harkens back to the very first Zelda, or more recently, LBW.

On that note, I think we are experiencing a shift in Nintendo's vision for Zelda. Currently, LBW is my all-time favorite Zelda. It's a little on the easy side, but it's the best-designed game by far. Everything has purpose. Everything works. Nintendo doesn't waste any space in LBW and it shows. And the new wall-merge mechanic is pure genius. It feels as natural as jumping. Any game can teach you a mechanic, but very few can make it second-nature like LBW does. The game even reignites my sense of what's *possible* in video games. That's not something you feel very often; the last games to do that to me were Bethesda's RPGs or most things by Valve.

So it should come as no surprise that I'm probably unreasonably excited for Zelda U, since they're taking Zelda back to its roots in a big bad way. I'm hoping it does for LBW what OoT did for LttP.

Outside of LBW as a recent favorite, I'd probably have to give it to *Twilight Princess* on GameCube. It doesn't outright insult you and hold your hand like SS; it follows OoT's formula with more streamlining; it has a great cast of characters and an even better story; the controls/combat/puzzles are absolutely top notch (provided you aren't playing the Wii version and flailing a Wii remote like a dumbass); its difficulty is balanced just right (not retardedly easy like SS; not needlessly hard like MM); the world feels enormous and mysterious. In short, it's everything you can ask for in a Zelda.

&gt;-Majora's Mask: Only got around to playing this recently. Great game, but just seemed like a less enjoyable / polished OOT.

You take that back right now. OoT and MM are totally different. Built on the same engine, yes, and sharing characters and characteristics, sure, but MM is very much its own thing. Doesn't really feel like OoT to me at all.

From the very beginning, MM establishes a totally different tone and structure than OoT. No gradual forward progress like in OoT; in MM you have to practice and repeat until you get good at maximizing your efficiency within the 3-day cycle. It's a totally novel way to play a dungeon crawler. Add that on top of the bone-chilling atmosphere and you have one of the darkest and most challenging Zeldas to date. It has this dread, this exigence that just makes you want to keep playing it and push through.

Gives me goosebumps just thinking about it. This ain't some paint-by-numbers adventure like OoT where your goal is to get the things, beat the dude, and save the girl. In MM, you're trying to fight an evil god and prevent *the end of the fucking world!* And you're still just a child! MM makes you feel small and helpless again, which is what you should feel in a big, terrifying world like Termina.

And this is without even getting into all the awesome Masks and sidequesting that most strongly distinguish MM from OoT, and make MM one of Zelda's strongest character studies. Each sidequest presents a vignette or episode of some kind that lets you get a slice of life for the people of Termina and truly sympathize with their plight under the tyranny and meddling of Skullkid. Because of time travel, you're the consummate fly-on-the-wall spectator.

MM falls more into the Wind Waker / Spirit Tracks type of Zelda, emphasizing dungeon quality over quantity, and that's just fine by me. I can see why people don't get a taste for MM, but don't you tell me it's a ""less polished"" OoT. I think that's disingenuous, since MM is nothing like OoT. It isn't *trying* to be like OoT."
13156,"Yeah, not to mention they say it like there's such a thing as a ""bad"" Zelda game. The Zelda franchise has sold a combined total of something like 75M copies for a reason. I'd take even the weakest Zeldas over many of the biggest budget AAA titles today."
59704,"WW never moves beyond B to attack and A to counter. It's like Assassin's Creed or any other hack-and-slash at that point. It feels basic, almost unrefined. Combat in WW is... adequate. Nothing more. TPGCN had waaaaaay more moves and variety, without getting dumb and palsied thanks to motion controls of TPW or SS."
