21646,"I am playing though windwaker rn on the Wii u and I know I will get downvoted for saying this but imo it's the worst of the 3d zelda easily.  Sailing around the ocean in the game is really boring and to me just a waiting period. This could just be where I have been, but every island I have been to that isn't a main island has nothing on it of intrest. The temples to me are way too easy which to me bored me and overall the game is super tedious"
