69139,"I love wind waker. It's one of the only games (the others being final Fantasy xii and King's Quest VI) that ever had me pulling out a notebook to keep track of hints, quests, and strategies. 

That being said, Link to the Past not even being mentioned in your list most likely means you're too young to have played it, which is a travesty. Pick up an SNES (virtual or real) today and fix that, you won't regret it. "
