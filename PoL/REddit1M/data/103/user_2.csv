511,"It's my favorite as well: They really nailed every aspect of a Zelda game that makes them a really enjoyable experience for me. I loved the graphics and graphically speaking this game has aged the best of all them relatively speaking. I loved the huge over world that was presented to you from the start and while not everything was available to you from the start that just added to my curiosity later on in the game. I also loved all the areas in the game because of how organic they felt, from the bustling town of Windfall Island to the quiet and serene Outset Island all these places felt real given that it's a game. The dungeons were also very solid with the only weak one in my opinion being the Tower of the Gods, the rest of the dungeons have exceptional flow in that you don't just zip right through them but you don't stand around not knowing what to do (also the Gohma fight in Dragon Roost Cavern is awesome). The uses of the Command Melody in the latter two dungeons was really cool and the Earth Wind, especially the Wind, are two of my favorites in the Zelda franchise.

Gameplay aside I really liked some of the other aspects that they added in the game, like Link having a family that stays somewhat relevant throughout the game. This game provides us with the most humanizing manifestation of the Gerudo King Ganondorf and paint him as a cynical leader who is lusting for vengeance after his people suffered in the desert rather than the *this is the bad guy, go get him*. Daphnes is also my favorite sidekick because of how impactful just his character is to the storyline (which I'll get to in a moment). The last scene where he stands there while Hyrule is flooded for the last time and him and Link reach out to each other is one of the most memorable video game moments to me, on par with the first time I set foot on Tallon IV as Samus Aran. The story is excellent also, it provides you with an entirely new world but also really connects to the Hyrule of old and you even visit it and have the last encounter there too. The entire game you spend sailing around you always know that Hyrule is right below you. Lastly, the soundtrack in this game is marvelous and last semester for a music theory class we had to do weekly journals to analyze pieces given a certain criteria and I chose a lot of songs from this soundtrack because from a composition point of view a lot of them are really cool!

Needless to say Wind Waker is hands down my favorite Zelda game and one of my favorite games of all time along with Metroid Prime."
6923,"The dungeons in Skyward Sword are easily the best collection in any of the Zelda games, while I still find Wind Waker to be better in a lot of aspects than Skyward Sword, Skyward Sword has it beat in dungeons easily."
6956,Literally came here to literally say this.

8628,I'd say right now the biggest circlejerk is the *DAE Twilight Princess underrated*? Because it's just now slipping into that nostalgia period.
8855,"Provided you get the wallet upgrades early, which I did by *accident*, this game and Twilight Princess throw so many rupees at you that I feel you have to go out of your way to not have the required amount.

That being said I do see the validity of the complaint but it's not like rupees are hard to obtain by any means."
9334,The item itself is an abhorrence but one thing Skyward Sword did the best was keeping every item relevant throughout the whole game. Something that Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess are horribly guilty of not doing.
9394,"I agree it's just funny how almost everyone is now shifting towards *I know this unpopular but Twilight Princess is a really good game*, as if there was ever any doubt."
9755,"Well speaking pedantically it's a wind blower since it just blows wind out of an orifice, what you decide to blow is entirely up to you but in Skyward Sword the only things I remember blowing was a lot of sand and some patches of lava."
10840,"After seeing Daphnes' play in Hyrule Warriors, it is super disappointing that Daphnes doesn't turn into a boat and then proceed to fuck up Ganondorf in the HD remake. "
17540,"I enjoyed a handful of tracks like Skyloft, Lake Floria, Ballad of the Goddess and Faron Woods but I found it a bit underwhelming compared to previous OSTs."
17611,I was being sarcastic and just mocking the *DAE this*. I have no problem with sailing and using the Requiem of Wind.
17787,"To me I think that Twilight Princess had a lot of shortcomings, I think it had the best template for a Zelda game to succeed on but it fell short in a lot of areas. The biggest one for me was the Twilight Realms and the wolf form, I feel that they could have done so much more with them and instead we got boring combat and three zones that were reduced to collection quests that were extremely tedious.

I also don't think that the first half of the game is very exciting at all, that being said the second half (right after Lakebed Temple) is probably my favorite portion of a Zelda game but overall I think Wind Waker lived up to its potential template a lot better than Twilight Princess did. Both are excellent games though."
17847,"I actually never thought of that, that would've been really cool if they had added more to Hyrule and essentially had all the Triforce pieces hidden away in the flooded Hyrule."
19214,Haven't played it so I can't really comment on the music.
22789,"Yoshi's Island is my favorite 2D game by far, that game is amazing!"
25253,Are you really implying that Ocarina of Time or Twilight Princess had *satisfying exploration*? While Twilight Princess had more than Ocarina of Time's Hyrule Field both are still really barren and don't contain much. 
35197,The only reason I remember the Lumpy Pumpkin theme is because its in 9/16.
94872,But Twilight Princess is still an easier game than Wind Waker.
95639,Twilight Princess does have a boss that doesn't attack you though.
96070,"Morpheel: I'm still convinced it's impossible to take damage from him, also the Gohma fight in Wind Waker is awesome. Twilight Princess had the best boss aesthetics by far but when they're all so pitifully easy it makes a lot of them forgettable except for Stallord and Arogrok who are just fun to fight."
96846,"Fyrus was thematically cool but he was such a joke, I mean again I feel you have to go out of your way to take damage from some of these bosses.

Also on the note of the spinner, Twilight Princess easily had the best items conceptually but they were hardly ever used, I loved the room before the Big Key in Arbiter's Grounds where you had to ride around on all those structures, felt like something out of a Sonic game but it was never used like that again. I will give Twilight Princess the edge in dungeons though, second favorite collection behind Skyward Sword."
