33269,"My first Zelda game was the very first one, and it holds a special place in my heart as a result. That said, Wind Waker is definitely my favorite Zelda title overall, even though it's a super close race. 

Some people hate it because they think it's all sailing, but honestly, that's just not all there is to it. Graphically it was beautiful. I think the original STILL holds up today, even with the Wii U HD release. The music was awesome. 

But the story is what gets me. I think it's the first time where Ganon isn't necessarily evil, but more misunderstood and going about things the wrong way. He really just wants to go home and bring Hyrule back, something that many could benefit from, but you (as the player, of course) and the King are on a mission to stop it. I think it's the most interesting portrayal of the villain, and it's one that sticks with me the most. 

It's funny, WW is definitely my favorite Zelda title, but it isn't the one I've played the most. It's just easily the one that resonates with me the most, and one that I can't really put down when I start playing it. "
