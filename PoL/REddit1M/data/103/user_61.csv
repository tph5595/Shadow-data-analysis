20201,"A Link to the Past is my favorite LoZ.  I've been playing LoZ since the original, had an original on the NES.  Blah blah.

First time I played WW was WWHD.  Normally not a huge fan of the 3D LoZ games but WWHD was incredibly awesome.  I loved it!  It converted me from not liking the 3D entries to giving them all a second shot.

I love WW."
