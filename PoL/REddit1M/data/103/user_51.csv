17105,"I love windwaker i just got it in HD and iv been enjoying it like crazy. I was one of the 12 year olds used to the artwork and graphics in OOT and Majoras mask and was like WTF is this it looks terrible. I bought it and love it. The open world, the comedy in the game and the artwork. As i grew older i saw the uniqueness of this game. Between the fire, water when sailing and the bombs blowing up i am still over enamored of how cool and beutiful the artwork is in the game.  The story is great and has twists and turns and it still feels like a pre skyrim to me but has guided rails on places you can go and explor. I recently got it in HD and i love it the sounds and art is smooth and enjoyable. Best of all i love the remake because they didnt touch is as much as they did to majoras mask 3ds which made it feel alien to me. This game is how i remember it every time i play it and people should enjoy the artwork for its uniqueness."
