No, and no"

92189,"The differences in perspective are big enough to have a trickle-down effect where it tends to affect all the other aspects of the game.  Art style, types of puzzles and combat, geography of the overworld and dungeons, even the way the stories play out."
96814,"Regarding the combat, it's some of the most responsive and fluidly animated action I've ever played in a video game.  It's simple, but not shallow by any means.  It's tons of fun.  There are so many ways to attack the enemies, whether you want to use your sword, incapacitate them with your tools, or even use their own tools against them.  Or you can make them attack each other if you jump out of the way in time.

Not to mention all the little touches.  For example, the times you can snap the ropes to make bridges fall while enemies are still standing on them, or how you can knock the enemies off the towers into the ocean or send them falling when they're grabbing onto the ledges.  And you can try to get their items from them with the grappling hook before killing them.  The only change I'd make to TWW's combat would be adding a finishing blow, which is so much fun to pull off in TP and SS.  IMO, it's so much more fun to fight a Darknut in TWW than in TP.  TP Darknuts are harder than in TWW but they're also less dynamic.

The most shallow combat in a 3D Zelda game is easily TP's wolf combat."
101266,"I still enjoyed Wolf Link, I just think they could have made him more interesting.

Also, I'm not trying to prove that TWW is difficult.  IMO, TWW, TP, and SS are all easy games, but that doesn't really bother me, because they're still fun for me (though I do like the hero mode in SS and TWW HD; and I'm sure it'll return in TP HD).  I was responding to the claim that its combat is shallow."
101623,"Uh, I don't really feel like it.  I'm sure I've discussed WW's art style before, but I don't feel like talking about it again now, especially because I'm 99% sure I won't change your mind about the art style.  If you didn't like it when you experienced it, you probably won't be convinced with words.

But I did discuss the combat a bit [here if you're interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/420qoi/anyone_else_who_puts_wind_waker_as_their_favorite/cz83jte)"
