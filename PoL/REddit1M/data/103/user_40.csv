I LOVE wind waker. OOT gets first place for just being really classic and ALWAYS a joy to play through. 

I always say that WW is my second favorite and people SHIT all over me for it. Even my other hard core zelda fans tell me I'm ridiculous for enjoying WW. 

Why??? I get it's technically not the truest zelda game, but the storyline is superb (my favorite) the cast of characters is AMAZING and unique. The music is so lively and the graphics are really good!!

Conversely I seriously hated TP and never finished it. I know, I know. I feel like TP is Batman Returns of the gritty zelda game. Even OOT and MM being as dark as they are, they were compellingly dark. MM has an interesting creepiness to it that none of the other zeldas have captured imho. 

I WANT to like TP but I just don't. WW to me, always takes the cake. 

I'd say skyward sword is 3rd, but seeing as how I haven't played MM, I feel like that would be my real 3rd if I ever played more than just a few minutes. "
