windwaker is whimsical,cute,dark,beautifully designed , full of memorable characters, the combat feels great and the exploration is deeply satisfying. it also helps that one of my kids watched me play from start to finish, utterly enraptured by it , asking me never to play while she wasn't there, she spots all the races, references,symbols and recurring characters in other zelda games now and advises me how to solve puzzles,at 5 years old and never having played other video games at that point."

hope there is another version of it for you down the track, even if its using a more advanced motion controller on another nintendo console"
114325,"which version did you play through ? I owned the GC version and had to leave it behind when I moved across the globe , hadn't quite finished it,had found aspects of the sailing frustrating.

got the Wii U version, the menu being constantly available with the map changed everything I'd found frustrating. the sailing became one of my favourite parts,especially with the higher speed sail added in.
