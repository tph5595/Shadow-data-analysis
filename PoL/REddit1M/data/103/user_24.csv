7558,I actually love the sailing. One of the best parts of the game imo. There's so many things to find and do while you're on the open ocean. plus the music and skybox are both fantastic
7640,"but the original WW had those dungeons on the ocean that had the exact amount of rupees in them for the charts, iirc all within 1 block of the chart location itself?"
8257,is it bad that i sometimes play that when going on roadtrips?
