13622,"&gt;Skyward Sword: Again, not into gimmicky motion controls. I loved the more happy tone than twilight princess, but in the later parts it seemed to drag on a little. 

I must be the only one in existence that is okay with the motion controls. The game even gives the player years to adapt to them before testing them in boss fights.

Edit: In fact I think the motion controls are the only reason the combat is any good. There are so many creative enemies to fight in SS because of them. "

edit: that part creeps me out so much. I felt like for that short window I got a glimpse of the dark side of zelda. "
