28487,"I played Ocarina of Time for the first time at age 20, only three years ago. I put it down around the forest temple and didn't pick it back up for a few months. It just... Lacked something, I guess. The final boss fight with Ganon was tense and is probably my most memorable moment from the game, but I have little desire to go back and replay it.

Wind walker though? Only played that for the first time last year and it was amazing. So much fun. So vibrant and colorful and just really, really fun to play. And really, it portrays Ganondorf in a better way, I feel, than his introductory game did. 

Now, I haven't played many Zeldas. I finished and loved Link between Worlds, I've started and not finished Skyward Sword 4 times, and I've played a little of Majora and Twilight, but none of them really captured me like the Windwaker did. 

Oh, and Hyrule Warriors is awesome, but I doubt it counts. "
