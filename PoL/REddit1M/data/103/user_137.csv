84571,"MM is my favorite. And the old school Link to the Past and Links Awakening have a very special place in my heart.  

Also, I appreciate your honesty about MM.  I know that before they re released it only a few people talked about it as their fav.  I was definitely one of those people. I thought the premise was awesome.  But somehow its now a cult favorite, even though if memory serves me right it did terribly in terms of games sold when it came out. People say it was a legacy system and all this Bullshit, but Twilight sold just fine for GC. They hopped on a bandwagon hard, when 15 year old them played it for all of an hour before abandoning it. So for that I commend you.  But I thing Clock Town and Termina Field are two of the most action oriented and task oriented parts of the game.  It was the last 'hard zelda' before Google made it impossible to make puzzles take longer than 10 minutes to solve before little entitled brats ran to a computer and watched how to beat it on youtube 

As far as WW....The fact it was rushed an not completed really disappointed me. The tri force shards were annoying. At least finding buried treasure in Phantom Hourglass was optional. The open water world was an awesome premise, but as far as the end, I think that it could have been the best had they finished it.  And it made me upset that they didn't even finish it on the re release.  I really wish they had...
