38451,"In my opinion wind waker holds up better than any other Zelda game. However, OOT absolutely blew my mind when it was released. It's hard to go back now to the original but my memories are so fond of that game.  Wind waker is much easier to play and look at now but it didn't drop my jaw like OOT did when released. But even a a bad Zelda game is a great game. "
44868,It took a while to get into and definitely not my preferred way to play any game but there were some great things about skyward sword. The design of the dungeons and the challenge even before you enter a dungeon was awesome. They actually had a progression system which gave more meaning to rupees. When the controls worked it was extremely satisfying and part of what made that game good. When they did not work however it was a chore and frustrating. Controls aside though I found some very awesome things in skyward sword.
