33177,"I have to say, when Wind Waker first came out, I was really turned off by it. As a whole I enjoyed a lot of the game but the sailing was so slow; while I understand it felt grand and adventurous for some, for me it just annihilated the pacing by bringing gameplay to a several minute sudden stop every time I left an island. Frankly I got halfway through hunting for Triforce Pieces, and I was so sailing around and farming rupees and just going on an elaborately monotonous oceanic fetch quest.

I just recently got the HD Remake, and it's done a lot for me, I love the game now. But it isn't my favorite.

I love the game's entire design; simply put, the game is *gorgeous.* Even without an HD coat of paint, it aged beautifully, and most of the aesthetic decisions are wonderful. It's a fantastic soundtrack that you want to listen to everywhere you go, the game is beautiful, the cel shaded faces are extremely expressive, the dungeons are fun, and the game has a great cast. Some of these things I could talk at length on, the game is, as a whole, a success. And the introduction of the Swift Sail goes a *LONG* way to making the game less tedious.

But it still falls short. The Great Sea still feels empty at times; there's a lot on a lot of islands, but a good number of islands feel pointless, and even sailing around at max speed they're all still kind of far apart, especially since if you need to go anywhere important it's at least 3-5 squares on the map away. I'm up to the Wind Temple right now and while I did take the time to explore the sea more (My gamecube run was a bit more minimalist) and map it out, due to that I feel like I've spent more time sailing than I have in any other portion of the game. It's not enough to turn me off the game, overall the Swift Sail and reduced Triforce quest goes a *long* way towards improving the game for me, but I still find myself kind of turned off after I've been at sea for so long and the game is admittedly pretty short."
