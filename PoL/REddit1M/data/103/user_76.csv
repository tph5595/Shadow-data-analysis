I will say, though, that I found it funny when reviews for Skyward Sword came out and people didn't bitch about the Sky, since it was a vastly less interesting, less fun, and less developed version of the Sea. Granted you didn't have to spend nearly as much time there, but that didn't make it any less of a barren wasteland of dullness."
