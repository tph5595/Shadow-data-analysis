No. Skyward Sword was miserable. It had potential to be a good game, but was severely handicapped by an awful control style. I have tried to play that game so many times, but I can't get more than about 15 minutes in before I want to throw my controller at the wall. I wish that game would get remade, more than any other Zelda game, but only if they allow a standard controller. I'd love to play it without feeling like I was just suffering through it."
