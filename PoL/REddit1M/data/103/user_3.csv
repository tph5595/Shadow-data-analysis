575,"WW is also my favorite Zelda game. Even my favorite game of all time! It was my first Zelda game, that I played, i love the soundtrack and the story and i really like the cartoonish artstyle. Yeah the game was a little short with parts that tried to make it seem long (gathering the Triforce) and I would have loved 1 or 2 dungeons more, but all in all it was great!"
