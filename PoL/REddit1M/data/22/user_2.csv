5470,"As a comment on the Sages, I'd just like to point out that they could theoretically be named in ANY of the three splits.

- Obviously, they would be known in the Adult timeline, as they were awoken and helped Zelda to seal Ganon at the end of OoT.
- SOME knowledge of them exists during the Downfall timeline, since we see some of their names within Zelda II's towns.
- What people may not think of is whatever Link told Zelda at the ending of OoT/the beginning of the Child timeline. It's completely possible that Link recounted every part of his adventure to Zelda, in order to be as convincing as possible towards the King of Hyrule of that era. Zelda and Link could never have convinced the King of Ganondorfs' intentions when Link first entered the Castle as a child... but maybe he could have, using details that no child should know of any of the regions of Hyrule. Regardless of the status of the Sages in this timeline, whether they still exist as spirits somewhere across time and space, or were simply never awakened, Link could easily have told Zelda their names, making their impact on the Child timeline just as feasible as any other. This is, of course, speculation, but it makes a lot of sense, considering the King then, you know, had Ganondorf executed down-the-line, and would likely only make that kind of decision with some extremely convincing knowledge (and I think Ganondorf also attacked Hyrule Castle anyways at some point? That probably gave the King good reason as well. =P).

So... maybe this doesn't help come up with anything concrete for timeline placement, but it does at least add more fuel to the ""which one is it"" fire."

47269,"So, if Zelda knows, then portions of the Royal Family are likely to know. And if portions of the Family know, then over time, I find it likely that that information would spread or become legend in some capacity. That information isn't likely to simply vanish forever within the Castle. Maybe the legacy of that influence was still able to spread thanks to the information the King himself gained from Zelda and Link; over time, they could have named new regions or land masses within the kingdom to reflect the influences of their decisions of the past.

Obviously, there's no proof of this. It's all speculation on my part. But I feel like some of that information used to execute Ganondorf must have been documented within the Castle."
