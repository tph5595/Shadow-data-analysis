95558,"Are we ever explicitly told that the Rito evolved from the Zora outside of a singular Aonuma interview? It's never explicitly stated in game that they are blood descendants, simply that they carry the musical artifacts the old sages once did. Because of this I personally think the Adult Timeline is accurate. 

I know that a lot of folks count on this information but it isn't beyond reality for them to have retconned a single thing that Aonuma stated long ago.

I honestly think the game takes place in the adult Timeline... there are too many things dropped into this game correlating with Wind Waker to ignore. A reference Zelda states in a couple of lines about being steeped in twilight doesn't prove anything, that can easily be a reference, but Koroks actually existing as well as Rito can't be seen as a ""reference"" or ""easter egg""

The other thing I wanted to note is how shark like and predatory the Zora look... They look like River Zora crossed with Lake/Ocean Zora. Count that with the fact that they live up river... and I'd say these aren't the typical Zora... Lastly the fishmen had to have evolved into something at some point right? Who's to say an entirely NEW race of Zora that are very similar to the old race can't exist?

Also Ganondorf sitting at the bottom of the ocean with the Master Sword in his head is a lame duck...  This Ganon appears to be the pure malignant manifestation of Demises power and fury. It's not so much ""Ganon"" as the pure hatred, and destruction that Demise intended to bring upon Hyrule long ago in ancient times against Hylia. 

The current ""Malice"" that taints the world even greatly resembles Demise himself... Ganon has always been quite tenacious - to a point that he seems impossible to completely get rid of. The fact that he is a reincarnation and manifestation of Demises power isn't beyond reason. Consider the nature of Ganon in this game I'd say he's is essentially just a vengeful, spiteful spirit who is driven only by his hate for Hyrule, Zeldam the Tri-Force, and Link. 

I honestly think it is the Adult Timeline albeit it's very far into the future, so far in fact that it really doesn't matter - they treat Ganon, the Tri-Force (the name of which seems lost in time), the Hero etc. all of it is treated like legend, and myth rather than actual history.

Because of this Ganon has become more of a ""force"" the Tri-Force a mythical power, and the motifs of the game seem to be that of emotion. Zelda curses her fate, Link essentially dies for 100 years attempting to live up to his fate, Ganon a force of pure malice.

I love this Zelda, but yeah, it's drastically more ""symbolic"" than the others in the series, and no amount of completing your destiny saves the champions, or the people of Hyrule, or Zelda from Ganon. It's dark. The plan doesn't work, and Ganon kills everyone... leaving the world in a state of ruin."
125511,The Adult Timeline is the Wind Waker Timeline bruh...
