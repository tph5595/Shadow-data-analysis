5632002,"And I quote, from Serbaayuu32, on https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/64r3yz/full_translation_of_zeldas_speech_in_japanese/ 
""The two important lines:
Zelda, referring to Link: ""Even if you dance the skies, you travel through time or you are dyed in twilight...""
Zelda, referring to the Master Sword: ""You cross the seas when you seek the gold made by the gods...""
This second obscured line completely crushes any meaningful impact this ceremony has in support of the Child Branch. There was a Hero who crossed oceans seeking the Triforce in the Adult and Fallen Branches - Wind Waker and Adventure of Link. (Although the AoL Hero did not wield the Master Sword while doing it, and Zelda is actually talking to the Master Sword at that point.) There was not a Hero who did this (so far) in the Child Branch. There isn't even a known Hero who has sought the Triforce in that Branch.
Thus, if this ceremony is meant to be historically accurate, it must be referring to the Fallen Branch games - possibly with AoL's lore corrupted because people assume every Hero must have wielded the Master Sword. If it's not meant to be historically accurate, the only ""evidence"" for the Child Branch is dust.
My own opinion is that this ceremony is mostly poetry, loosely based in history, probably corrupted over thousands and thousands of years (before the ceremony itself was invented, even).
Oh yeah, we should include your comment, /u/XpRienzo, that the word used for ""twilight"" in this speech is the same one used to describe the twilight of the Sacred Realm in the ALttP manual.""

TL;DR, The original Japanese mentions aLttP, not Twilight Princess. BotW takes place in Downfall."

According to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/64r3yz/full_translation_of_zeldas_speech_in_japanese/), Zelda's original Japanese words in the speech refer not to Twilight, but the Dark World from aLttP. She also mentions ""crossing the seas while you seek the gold made by the gods"". That's Windwaker right there.  
So yeah, a major piece of evidence for the Child Timeline destroyed. (Or not, it's still your decision.)  
EDIT: [This post](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/64r3yz/full_translation_of_zeldas_speech_in_japanese/dg4e5o2/) explains why it's Dark World and not Twilight Realm."
