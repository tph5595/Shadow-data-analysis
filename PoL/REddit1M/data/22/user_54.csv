46181,"&gt; Any my main reason for placing it after that game is the Master Sword. It's still the Light Sword, which was first created in Twilight Princess, but is now weaker. The light fades with use, so it still has the power, but after all this time (undetermined amount) the Light needs to recharge after so much use.

Do we have any evidence for any of this?

Also, how do you explain the Zora monument mentioning that Ruto became a sage?"
133885,"In the Child timeline, the Adult portion of Ocarina of Time never happened. Ganondorf was imprisoned (as seen in the Ganondorf's Execution cutscene in Twilight Princess), and Ruto never awoken as a sage.


Unless you have concrete evidence and can explain this apparent inconsistency, I don't see how BotW can possibly take place after TP."
