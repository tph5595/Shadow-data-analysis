24449,"How much time has there been between other Zeldas? I would expect it taking quite some time for the Ruto to develop from Zoras, so there has been quite a long time between OoT and Wind Waker. The long time gaps between games is probably Nintendo's excuse for all the differences between games.

Obviously, if compared to our world and development, Hyrule has been intensively sitting on their hands to have such little technological development (the divine beasts are 10,000 years old etc). The time is oddly specific though, maybe they have some plans to show the 10,000 years ago as well."
