31066,"I think it's silly to try and place these games so rigidly together. Obviously some games are direct sequels and have references to the other games (Ocarina of Time --&gt; Wind Waker), but many of them clearly were made to not fit into canon (Four Swords Adventures). Nintendo just made a ""timeline"" because fans demanded it.

At this point, I just consider it a story that occurs after Ocarina of Time. We know for sure Ocarina of Time occurred. That's about it. I feel like Nintendo told the very first Zelda story with Skyward Sword, and Breath of the Wild is the very last Zelda story. "
