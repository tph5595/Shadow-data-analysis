0,"It's no secret that the fanbase is divided on where BotW sits in the timeline. So, let's look at the evidence. Even if we don't come to a consensus (and let's face it, we probably won't, we've all got our preferred canons), it can't hurt to have all the information in one place.

**What We Know**
BotW is post-Ocarina of Time. Ganon exists, and the Kingdom of Hyrule has existed for at least 10,000 years, if not longer. This means that:

* Skyward Sword happened.
* Minish Cap happened.
* Four Swords happened.
* Ocarina of Time happened, in some capacity.

So, let's sort out the rest.

**Adult Timeline**

This is the timeline where Link, Zelda and the Seven Sages defeated Ganon by imprisoning him in the Sacred Realm, and then Link went back in time to live out his childhood, creating the Child Timeline. Without a Hero to protect them in the Adult Timeline, Ganon escaped, killed the Sages that maintained the Master Sword's power, and Hyrule was flooded by the gods in a last-ditch effort to avert catastrophe. As far as we know, the Master Sword is currently lodged in Ganondorf's forehead, at the bottom of the Great Sea.
This timeline includes everything up to Ocarina of Time (including the Adult Link portion), Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks.

As of Spirit Tracks, Tetra, Link and the pirate crew had founded New Hyrule, on a large landmass far from the Great Sea.

**Evidence FOR the Adult Timeline**

* Koroks exist.
* Rito exist.
* The item description for Rock Salt mentions an ancient sea.
* The Divine Beasts Vah Nabooris and Vah Ruta were named after the Sages Nabooru and Ruto, respectively. It's conceivable that Vah Rudania was therefore named after Darunia. This would imply that Vah Medoh was named after Medli.
* It rains. All the time. It's possible Hyrule *is yet to be* flooded, but will be, because the Hero will not return (because he's getting sidetracked picking flowers and doing sidequests)
* j/k, it's probably just regular rain.

**Evidence AGAINST the Adult Timeline**

* BotW doesn't take place in New Hyrule. Many of the landmarks are exclusive to the original Hyrule, including Death Mountain, Kakariko Village and Zora's Domain, which according to Arts and Artifacts, should become Dragon Roost Island after the flood.
* The Rito of the Adult Timeline evolved from the Zora, and those Zora that did not remain in Zora's Domain (which became Dragon Roost Island) are *implied*, but not outright stated, to have become the Geozards, who bear a striking resemblance to the River Zora from the Downfall games. However, in BotW, Zora's Domain remains intact, and the Rito and Zora are two distinct races.
* Hyrule was covered in ocean in the distant past of Skyward Sword as well, so the Rock Salt does not necessarily mean the Great Sea, but it still *may*. There's reasons for and against supporting the Rock Salt argument. The Lanaryu Sand Sea was once ocean, and eventually became Lanaryu Province, which is land-locked in Twilight Princess (containing Hyrule Field, Castle Town and Lake Hylia). This area (which is more accurately Faron Province in BotW) is *mostly* land-locked as of BotW, although there is a coastline south of Lake Hylia. BotW's version of Lanaryu Province, however, is *completely* land-locked, with Akkala, Necluda and Faron instead being the coastal provinces.
* No Anouki, even in mountainous regions like Hebra. As of Spirit Tracks, they were a major race in (New) Hyrule, so where did they go?
* The Hylian crest is the OLD Hylian crest, containing the Triforce and the Crimson Loftwing, rather than New Hyrule's crossed cutlass pirate flag, the stylised lobster-and-triforce, or even the winged man from Wind Waker's Hylian Shield.


**Child Timeline**

Ah, *now* we're getting somewhere. This is the timeline where Link relived his childhood, saved Termina and the Skull Kid from Majora's Mask, became an accomplished swordsman, but was not remembered in Hyrule as the Hero of Time. He died with nobody remembering his heroism, and became the Hero's Shade, and the Skull Kid may or may not guard the Master Sword, in honour of his old friend. Gandondorf was executed by the *spirits* of the Seven Sages shortly after arriving in Hyrule and meeting the king, and then the events of Twilight Princess and Four Swords Adventures took place.

**Evidence FOR**

* Zelda alludes to the events of Twilight Princess in a speech anointing Link as a Champion.
* Ganon has been fought multiple times in this timeline (twice, that we know of), which is something that Aonuma said was a prerequisite for BotW's timeline placement.
* The stone carving from Twilight Princess HD features Rito, suggesting that Rito exist in this timeline after all. *(Thanks to Caviel for the catch!)*

**Evidence Against**

* The Sages, as of BotW, were awoken by Link, and assisted Link and Zelda in defeating Ganondorf. This can be seen by reading one of the stone carvings along Zora's River which explicitly names Ruto as a Sage and recounts the final battle with Ganondorf, which is not something that happened in the Child Timeline, as the Hero of Time didn't fight Ganondorf. He was stopped before claiming the Triforce.
* Likewise, Nabooru is outright named as a Sage.
* On the Amiibo, Wolf Link's description says it comes from another dimension. *(thanks to Lousy_Username for mentioning this!)*
* Alternate interpretation of the Twilight Princess HD Rito carving: the Hyrule of TPHD may be aware of the multiple timelines, to some capacity. This would explain why Zelda mentions Twilight, because other timelines are aware of each other. This is pure speculation, but does throw a spanner in the works.



**Downfall Timeline**

This is the timeline of the NES, SNES and Game Boy Zelda games, as well as A Link Between Worlds and Tri Force Heroes. It's the timeline during which the Adult Timeline occurred, up until the final battle with Ganondorf and/or Ganon, but the player got a Game Over and Link died. At this point, Zelda and the Seven Sages intervened, leading to the Imprisoning War from A Link to the Past's prologue.

**Evidence For**

* Maze Island and Rauru Town from Zelda II both exist, in roughly the same positions they had in that game.
* This is a timeline in which Ganon has been fought several times, and has been defeated time and time again. As of A Link Between Worlds, Ganon was slain in this timeline no less than *five* times.
* The general aesthetic of the game; a world reclaimed by nature and overrun with monsters, strongly corresponds to the original NES The Legend of Zelda game.
* The Sheikah are consistently a part of the story in the Downfall Timeline, as opposed to Child where Impaz is the only Sheikah left, and Adult, where the Sheikah aren't mentioned at all.The manual of Zelda II even references Impa coming from a lineage of lorekeepers who serve the Royal Family. *(thanks to EternalKoniko for reminding me!)*
* Lost Woods and Master Sword are in the north like in A Link to the Past. *(courtesy of EternalKoniko)*
* The Ruto monument near Zora's Domain suggests that the Divine Beasts were constructed after Ocarina of Time, and that Vah Ruta was named in honour of the Sage of Water, Ruto. This could only have happened in the Downfall and Adult Timelines, and as stated earlier, the evidence for the Adult Timeline isn't as strong as for the other timelines.

*(Edited for Clarity)*

**Evidence Against**

* Zora are friendly. More or less. At the very least, they're not *hostile*, which they generally are in Downfall games.
* The Hero fought and defeated Ganondorf in BotW's past. This didn't happen in the Downfall, since the Hero died in battle.

**Evidence Neither For Nor Against**

* We know that Calamity Ganon was defeated originally by the Hero, the Princess, AND an army of Guardians created by the Sheikah. That sure doesn't sound like any Ocarina of Time I know of!
* The technology of the Divine Beasts and Guardians matches the distant past of Skyward Sword. The Ancient Robots are one of the tribes that fought for Hylia against Demise, and much like the Guardians themselves, resemble Jomon-era pottery from ancient Japan. Aesthetically, Ancient Robots and Guardians may be synonymous with each other.
* Following this logic, the battle 10,000 years ago may refer to Skyward Sword's prologue, when the first Hero, Hylia and the tribes of ancient Hyrule (including a far more abundant race of Sheikah and their Ancient Robots) fought against, and sealed away Demise.
* This would make any mention of the battle 10,000 years ago irrelevant to the conversation.
* This is full of ""could haves"", which is why it is neither for nor against, but is mentioned for the sake of noteworthyness.

*(Edited for Clarity)*



**Unified Timeline**

This one is just for fun.

More of a thought experiment than an official timeline, but theoretically this would be a timeline created by the events of Hyrule Warriors. Cia and Lana merged several timelines in that game, although in the base game, only the Child Timeline was touched. Ruto and Darunia had no mention of being Sages, and were always referred to as a ""Goron Chieftain"" and ""Zora Princess"". Not Sages. Likewise, the events of Twilight Princess were referred to as if they were historical fact. In the DLC packs, as well as Legends, further timelines were introduced. The Adult Timeline was treated as ""another dimension"", which makes sense, considering it was a ""future that never was,"" from the perspective of the characters.

**Evidence For**

* Rito and Zora exist alongside one another. Everything we know about the Rito says they should not exist in a universe containing both Zora and Zora's Domain, and yet here we are.
* The Amiibo item descriptions treat every Hero's tunic and weapon as belonging to somebody that actually existed. The Great Sea is treated like a real place, and the Tunic of Twilight is treated as belonging to an actual Hero that existed.
* Aonuma treats Hyrule Warriors itself like ""another dimension."" And that's what split timelines *are*, by definition.
* Medli, Darunia, Ruto and Nabooru are all historical figures that existed in ""old"" Hyrule in this timeline. This reconciles Vah Medoh's namesake with a world in which Hyrule was apparently never flooded.

**Evidence Against**

* Hyrule Warriors is probably non-canon. Let's be realistic.
* Amiibo items are probably non-canon.



**The ""It's so far in the future that it literally doesn't matter"" Timeline**

Breath of the Wild is 10,000 years post-Ocarina (if not longer). Any number of events could have occurred in that time. Maybe Rito exist in other timelines. Maybe the Great Sea receded, and Hyrule proper was re-established. Places from the Downfall Timeline could've been built in the Child Timeline. Who knows? Maybe the events of the past have become *legend*, and none of it was really true. Maybe all of it was. Maybe it doesn't matter at all."

10980,"Honestly, I'd like to avoid ""could haves"", which is why I'm going with what we *absolutely* know to be evidence in favour of a particular timeline.

Saying ""the Sages could have awoken in Child"", or ""Link could have told Zelda about the Sages in Child"" isn't evidence.

So, since we *know* that the Child timeline splits off before the Sages are awoken, then the evidence suggests until proven otherwise that the Sages were not awoken."
11161,"This is a very good point. The stone slab about Ruto says it happened long before the Divine Beasts.

In that case, it could be:

* Spirit Tracks AD + 10,100
* Four Swords Adventures AD (since that occurs after TP) + 10,100

or

* Tri Force Heroes AD + 10,100

God, Hyrule is *old*.
10,000 years ago we were hunting *mammoths*."
11357,"It's also possible that he's just simply so *mindless* at this point.
Between Koume and Koutake's failed resurrection and Yuga body-snatching him, how much of Ganondorf the man would even be left?"
48448,"Really? I didn't know that about Wolf Link.
Adding to the OP!"
48760,"Notice how it's made of stone and isn't a mirror.
That ain't the Mirror of Twilight."
49109,"The Master Sword glows with the light to repel evil in many games, not just Twilight Princess when powered by the Sols.

For instance, Skyward Sword. It's not evidence in favour of Twilight Princess.

And Koroks are said to be invisible to most people. Perhaps you're right, and they simply hadn't evolved yet. Maybe they were all over Faron Woods and TP Link never saw them. Or maybe they were invisible.
Either way, it's too many ""maybes""."
49531,"Honestly, this is my preferred interpretation of the 10,000 years.

Like you said, the Ancient Robots were one of the tribes united by Hylia. And the Sheikah were more abundant then, too.

And SS does mention the original Hero (what with the sailcloth ceremony) so it's not like Himekawa just pulled the idea out of thin air when writing the manga."
50256,"It would be kind of hilarious if this was Nintendo's reasoning.

They're on the record as taking a lot of inspiration from Skyrim, so why not aspects of TES lore, as well?"
50619,"Yes, exactly.

Evidence against a timeline doesn't disprove it, it simply says that there's evidence against it.

There's evidence for and against *every* timeline.

And yes, if we delve into ""could haves"", then yes, the events of Twilight Princess *could* have happened in other timelines. It doesn't resolve anything (for OR against), and therefore isn't worth mentioning."
50768,"Yes, this is why I didn't mention it. I *almost* did, but as it was the place where the Sages executed Ganondorf, then clearly it existed in Ocarina of Time."
51222,"No, I agree with Ender_Skywalker.
The Arbiter's Grounds were where Ganondorf was executed by the spirits of the Ancient Sages after Young Link warned the Royal Family.

That means it existed in Ocarina of Time, we just didn't see it."
65941,"A Link Between Worlds uses the Master Sword, and is set after ALttP.

I like that bit about the Child Timeline having the Rito in that one carving, though. Forgot about that!"
66607,"It's definitely an afterthought, but to say it doesn't exist at all flies in the face of officially Nintendo-sanctioned products, like Hyrule Historia. Aonuma himself has even stated that it exists.

I will agree that it doesn't matter to Nintendo as much as it matters to fans, but it does exist."
84910,"A couple hours, on and off. Just kept my browser open and got back to it every now and then."
612797,"How about how it looks nothing like the Mirror of Twilight, and isn't even found in the Gerudo Desert?

If you want to prove that they are the same you have to provide better arguments than the ones you gave."
613955,"You mean ""isn't canon to the three current timelines"".

Aonuma says it ""exists in another dimension"", which is the same terminology used to differentiate between the various timelines.

Hyrule Warriors is the beginning of its own canon. I'll agree that BotW *probably* doesn't take place after HW (but it's fun to theorize as it does make a surprising amount of sense), and Nintendo will most likely never outright acknowledge the Koei Tecmo-developed games, but we'll probably see a Hyrule Warriors 2 at some point that continues in the ""Warriors"" timeline."
827031,"That's actually not a bad interpretation, I gotta say.

It ties up a lot of loose ends pretty neatly. Not sure if I necessarily agree with it 100%, but I like it."
5667875,"Ha, you're welcome. :)"
5668670,"Ooh, fantastic.

I'm adding this to the OP."
