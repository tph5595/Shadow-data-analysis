12216,"Aw /u/srstable  said, It isn't 10,000 years after Ocarina of time. It is however not 10,100 years after TP PH or Zelda 2 either. it's 10,000 years since CALAMITY Ganon last attacked, meaning there was another attack some point farther down whichever timeline it's set in. 

The problem with pinpointing the timeline placement based on locations is &gt;10,000 years is such a long time for the geography to be changing considering that Ocarina of time to TP  WW or ALTTP had such major geographical differences that 2/3 are unrecognizable, while the other has gaping holes in it now as well as an entire lake somehow jumping from the south-west of death mountain to the north-east of it, the point being that geography changes rapidly in this game. It is even possible, though unlikely that the oceans dried up and New hyrule began rediscovering Old hyrule going back to that culture while keeping their more advanced technology."
