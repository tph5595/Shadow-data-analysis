Agreed, even moreseo it makes no sense for them to establish New Hyrule, in ""distant lands"" then move back into old hyrule for no reason.

Also, ""ancient sea"" doesn't have to be THAT sea from wind waker. It could've been a much earlier ancient sea like we have in the real world with repeated moments where areas were partially or wholly covered by water(that we still have evidence of). I mean, Lanayru desert was formerly an ""ancient sea"" even by the time of skyward sword."
