39665,"I believe that WW takes place about 1,000 years after OoT.  
Not entirely sure where I heard that. It could have been Hyrule Historia, but I can't remember for sure. That's the time gap I've been using though.  
From a really quick google search, it seems that Aonuma just says ""hundreds of years"", so I guess 1,000 is just one estimate, or probably the maximum because after that they would say something like ""over a thousand""."
