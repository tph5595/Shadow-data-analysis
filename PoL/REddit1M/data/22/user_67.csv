55211,"One bit of kit that keeps being ignored, is actually from Twilight Princess: The City in the Sky. The city is ancient and is technology that doesn't seem to exist anywhere else in the world, and accessed via an ancient cannon.

This means a highly technological period existed prior to TP, but had since fallen behind. The timeframe of where TP falls into things may be in question.

Additionally, the constant reference to Ganon as *Calamity Ganon* suggests that he is an evolved form of Ganon, perhaps where he learned about and began to meld with Sheikah technology, which would predate the Skyward Sword era (given all the long-abandoned technology in it).

Within the game itself though, it's only said that Calamity Ganon was defeated 10,000 years ago by the machines, but that his return has very clear signs. It doesn't specifically say that the 10,000 years prior was the ONLY time he was resurrected - in fact, it's suggested he's returned a number of times since then, if the signs are made so clear. But this time, instead of it being a new way to defeat him, the machines were used -again-, so he was aware of them and already had a plan to defeat/control them like he did."
