27410,"If we talk about what could have happened, then interaction with the twilight realm could have happened in any other timeline too. Then what reason do we have for discussing the child timeline at all?

Each timeline has ways to rationalize the inconsistencies, but thats what they are: rationalizations. Talking about what could have happened doesn't really bring any clarity to the discussion."
29125,"""Evidence against"" doesn't mean ""it can't be in this timeline."""
30362,"If it's not evidence against, then the ""evidence for"" isn't for it either - see my previous reply.

If we're going to talk meaningfully about what timeline is supported, then stuff that is inconsistent with what we currently *know* about the timelines is important to discuss. No matter which timeline it ends up being in, such things will have to be reconciled, so making the point that it *can* be reconciled if we're creative enough is moot.  

Edit: You may want to go back and read the ""Evidence Against"" for the Child timeline again. It is not about Rito."

The group of Ancient Sages that you see in TP is a different group than the Seven Sages of OoT. I'm not sure if it's made clear if the latter are meant to replace the former, or to coexist for different purposes, but they are not the same."
61512,"That sounds right to me. Which is why we don't see the OoT sages in TP: they weren't part of the Execute Ganon plot.

It's also my understanding that Sages only awaken when needed. So Ruto and co. always had *potential* to be sages, but would only awaken in the moment they are needed. When someone with Sage potential dies, that potential moves on to someone else. So, while it's possible that the OoT sages were awakened in the Child Timeline, we don't know of any event that would have caused it."
