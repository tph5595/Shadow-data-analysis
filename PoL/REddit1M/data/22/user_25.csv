30336,"I think the game is heavily implying that there are times that Ganon has been fought that aren't yet games. The events of 10,100 years ago is not part of any game. That's the first time they fought Calamity Ganon. This is *after* Ocarina of Time, because Impa describes the events of OoT and mentions that they happened in ancient times, before even the events of the first Calamity Ganon. 

So I think it's reasonable to think that people may have gotten their stories mixed up. Maybe they didn't actually become sages. Maybe that is a mis-remembered legend. 

But I personally do think that the only timeline that doesn't make sense is the adult timeline. I can't believe that the oceans receded for no reason. The ocean is what was locking away old Hyrule and Ganon. And nobody has any memory of a time when the ocean covered the lands, which is certainly something that would have lasted through the collective memory if something like Ocarina of Time did. "
