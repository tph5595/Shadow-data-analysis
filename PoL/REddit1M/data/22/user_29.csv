31508,"For the landmark thing the ruined ranch is actually Lon Lon Ranch from OoT. There's two giant rocks that made up the old border of that place, there's two ruined housing structures, the stables and the actual house, there's the oval shaped horse track, and most importantly, there's the stone tower in the back where the heart piece was in OoT, a bit ruined.


As for where I think it's in the timeline, I still think it's the child timeline. Remember that the sages were the ones who executed Ganon in TP, and we only saw their spirits in that game in a flashback. Which means that sages were awoken anyway. Whose to say child Link didn't awaken everyone before heading off to Termina? 


There's signs of ancient technology in Twilight Princess as well. The Mask Midna wears has a guardian like vibe to it. The city in the sky looks a lot like the mechanical structures of the divine beasts. The Oocoo could have eventually evolved into Rito. More importantly, the mirror of Twilight is also in BotW as well. Koroks were said to have evolved from Kokiri, which is something that could have happened in the child timeline.


As for certain names like Medoh, could just be a coincidence. There's virtually zero evidence that the Rito are the same ones as the ones that lived on Dragon Roost. Makes that seem more coincidental to me. Probably just a nice throwback thrown in by Nintendo. 


The Lost Woods being up north is the only strange thing to me. Then again, the land area in TP was already warped enough as is with Zora's domain being directly up north of Hyrule Castle. Curiously the lost woods are on an island. I'm not sure what that means but it certainly doesn't match up with any game so far. 


Finally the temple of time is actually directly south of Hyrule Castle just like in TP. The old statues that guarded the entrance in TP reek of shiekah technology. The Lost Woods could have shifted north if the Deku tree sprout was planted up there. As a matter of fact, all the trees in the lost woods look like old Deku Trees anyway, hinting that the Deku tree is able to spread. 


EDIT: I haven't explored the castle town ruins yet but on first glance it shares the same layout as the on found in TP. I'll have to do some more digging around when I play the game again. If there's evidence of structures from TP it will be hard to argue against the child timeline. "
42475,"&gt;Those were the ancient sages from the Era of Chaos, not the Ocarina of Time sages.

Proof of this? From Zelda wiki the sages in TP were ""young tutors of Zelda."" The same Zelda from Twilight Princess. The era of chaos was shortly after the events of Skyward Sword. They can't be the same people. What's true is that the sages in TP originate after OoT. To further quote.

""It is possible that the sages seen in Twilight Princess, the ones mentioned by Princess Zelda in the same game, and Rauru, along with the other ancient sages he mentions in Ocarina of Time, are all the same group of Ancient Sages. All three groups are either referred to as ""ancient sages"" or as ""sages"" who have existed ""since ancient times"", though it is also possible each reference is to a separate group of sages, who are simply being described as existing since long ago.""


&gt; Great. But the Twili's technology is pre-OoT because it originated and was utilized during the Interloper War.

So what? Shiekah technology was also in Skyward Sword. This doesn't disprove anything.

&gt; No, it's not.

The mirror itself is not in BotW but a monument that looks like it is. Zelda specifically references the Hero of Twilight. Seeing how Hyrule Castle in TP was literally imprisoned in Twilight and was visible to people, it's not a stretch to say people are aware of the Twilight realm and built monuments to it. "
