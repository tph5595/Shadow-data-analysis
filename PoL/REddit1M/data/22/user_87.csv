95543,"I really believe that this game's timeline  is based on the Adult timeline where Link Didn't go back to the past thus the Hero of Time was there to defeat Ganon and prevented the Great flood
and considering that the mentioning about Princess Ruto the water sage sounds that they are victorious on this timeline 
&gt;History of the Zora, Part Five The Sage Princess Ruto As told by King Dorephan
Long, long ago... In a past more distant than even the Great Calamity or the creation of the Divine Beast Vah Ruta...
There was a Zora princess named Ruto.
We know that she was an attendant to the Zora patron deity and that she was a fair and lively girl, beloved to all.
Around the same time, an evil man with designs on ruling the world appeared, bringing disaster upon Zora's Domain.
It is said that Ruto then awoke as a sage, facing this foe alongside the princess of Hyrule and the hero of legend.
Her achievements are remembered not only by the Zora, they are also forever etched in the history of Hyrule.

so this only proves that ~~Maybe~~ this timeline is based on the Adult Timeline where They are victorious but the Hero of Time never came back to the past to recollect the lost times he had, and he was there to defeat Ganon and prevented the Great Flood.

Basically this is Adult Timeline where Link didn't go back to the past so he was there to defeat Ganon and prevented the great flood "
