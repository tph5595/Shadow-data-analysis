The original argument is 

Oot Link : hero of time :: ruto : water sage

Whether or not they are remembered/awakened as such, they still *are*. "

However, it still fits on a timeline in the same way you could work mass effect on the home alone timeline. Death of the author, or whatever. 

It's fun to examine lore - written, implied, and emerged. "

Judging by the huge advancement of gameplay, I'd say this is likely their attempt to put a cap on the previous entries and start anew, as it's hard to keep up with lore that was only made to explain why you're killing 8bit spongeblobs.

Im definitely pro-unified, and think they'll *maybe* throw in one more pre-botw game to tie the timelines with a climactic final entry, cleaning the loose ends oot made. 

Other than that, I'd guess that from now on they're likely done with pre-botw games and will likely just continue on with this new timeline they've created."
