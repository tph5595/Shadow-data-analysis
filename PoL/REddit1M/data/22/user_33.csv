I guess according to the letter of Demise's curse, the only thing that's immortal is his hatred.  Consciousness and personality, not as much.  They're just along with hatred for the ride, but have no guarantee."

Historians weren't entirely sold on the notion of there even being human civilization 10,000 years ago.  The best evidence we have is an ancient temple called [Gobekli Tepe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6bekli_Tepe).

And on the topic of Gobekli Tepe, there are numerous parallels between it and the Divine Beasts.  Enough where I have to wonder if they are inspired by it.  For example, the only reason we know about Gobekli Tepe is that for some reason, the people who built it decided to bury it.  Last I heard, nobody knows why.  If they didn't bury it to preserve it, it would have been utterly annihilated by the elements over 10,000 years.  Also, it may just be me, but it seems the art style of the exterior of the divine beasts is heavily inspired by what we see of Gobekli Tepe.

So, the thing about Gobekli Tepe, is that a lot of fringe historians use it as evidence for 10,000 year or older Atlantean style human civilizations that were wiped out by cataclysm.  These are the sorts of historians who think the Sphinx has water erosion, indicating it's much older than mainstream historians believe it to be.  I wish I knew the exact terms to google, but there is a fringe of historians (although I'm sure many historians would lump them in the same category as cryptozoologist) that believe this isn't the first time humans have climbed the civilizational ladder.

But, the point I'm trying to make, is that when you talk about 10,000 years ago, you may as well be referencing another universe.  There is precisely zero about Gobekli Tepe we can find in the world today.  Nothing about the civilization that built it, it's culture, it's people, it's works.  Scientists can only make educated guesses about what the environment was like back then, which is to say, as different as one can imagine from the way it is today.  They barely had the same animals back then!  Hell, they were only approximately the same people we are today back then.  You go back 10,000 to 20,000 years, and you're charting the last phases of [human evolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_human_evolution)."
