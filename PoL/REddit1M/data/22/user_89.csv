99549,"It's more than a 10,000 year gap, isn't it?

I may be mixed up but I thought it was 10,000 years ago that Ganon was defeated by the princess and the hero, and at that time an army of guardians were built to support the two.

This means, because the guardians are a new creature we haven't seen before, that the 10,000 year ago event is not one that is a game (yet)."
