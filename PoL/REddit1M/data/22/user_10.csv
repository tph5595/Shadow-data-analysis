21386,"* Impa's presence has no bearing on the state of the Sheikah Tribe. We see her in OoT and SS - no Sheikah. We see Impaz in TP - no Sheikah.

* True, but the massive 10,000 year gap between games may render this a moot point

* True, but the presence of the Deku Tree and Lost Woods in this area may suggest we have to just chalk this up to Hyrule's ever-changing geographical layout. But the Lost Woods are in the north in ALttP so this is probably your strongest point."
29285,"&gt; Except you're wrong?

Good one.

&gt; In SS, the Sheikah are simply unseen and Impa is the only Sheikah that is crucial to the story. The Surface is a vast and mysterious place. We know there are more than just Impa because the tribe eventually comes to serve the royal family and it is highly speculated that during the Era of Chaos, a faction of them became the Dark Interlopers from TP's backstory.

You're missing the point - the point that you initially made.

The Sheikah obviously exist throughout the history of Hyrule. The point that *you* brought up is that Impa's presence indicates that the Sheikah are ""thriving"" - not merely existing. 

In Skyward Sword, we see no signs of Sheikah influence outside of Impa. So I wouldn't say that the Sheikah tribe are currently playing a large role in the affairs of the realm. Or maybe they are - we can't say. The point is that Impa's presence alone does not tell us about the current state of the Sheikah.

&gt; In Ocarina of Time, we see Impa and she mentions she's among the last of her tribe.

Yup. Again, the Sheikah are not thriving.

&gt; In Twilight Princess, Impaz is the last Sheikah. Perhaps not racially as Fanadi seems to be of Sheikah-descent, but she's the last of the organized Sheikah society. Also at one point, Gor Coron says that the tribe that protected the Royal Family of Hyrule ""dwindled in the prolonged wars."" To me at least, this evidences that during the Hyrulean Civil War most Sheikah were killed defending Hyrule. This aligns with Impa being among the last of her people. Prolonged Wars, however, also may imply more wars. Perhaps including the Interloper War and the speculated Hylian-Gerudo War. So basically, we can deduce that in the CT the Sheikah are almost extinct.

No we cannot deduce that the Sheikah are almost extinct. OoT Impa stated that she was among the last of her kind, and yet we know that the Sheikah survived. We have the exact same situation here - Impaz is among the last of the Sheikah. They are not thriving, but it is certainly possible that they could come back. We have seen them do it before.

&gt; In the Adult Timeline, we see absolute no sign of the Sheikah outside their symbol and an artifact that may have been created by them. It seems, if the Sheikah are still around, Tetra and WW Link never met them and reincorporated them into New Hyrule.

Yup.

&gt; In the Downfall Timeline, we have the most depictions of the Sheikah and have consistently seen them serving the royal family and serving as lore keeper. In fact, the Sheikah (through Impa) appear in OoX, ALBW, LoZ, and AoL.

As I illustrated, the presence of Impa does not have any bearing on the state of the Sheikah tribe. We can presume that they are alive, but we cannot presume that they currently play an important role in the kingdom or are ""thriving"" - as you said. 

Therefore, Impa's presence in any game has no bearing on the role that the Sheikah are playing at that point in the timeline. Her presence only tells us that the Sheikah still exist - which is not useful information as they exist during most of the timeline. "
32058,"&gt;  In the DT, the sole Sheikah represented, Impa, is serving the Royal Family and mentions her tribe. 

This also applies to OoT - where we know that the Sheikah tribe do not play a role in the events of the kingdom.

And the Sheikah have never been mentioned in the Downfall Timeline. All we know is that Impa is around, and that she is a member of the Sheikah tribe. We know nothing about the state of the tribe in these games, or their role in the kingdom. As OoT illustrates, Impa's role with the Royal Family does not suggest that the Sheikah as a tribe play a prominent role in the kingdom.

&gt; in SS the Sheikah eye appears on Timeshift Stones in Lanayru, which is proof they are around.

The Sheikah eye appears in Wind Waker too - in the Forsaken Fortress. It also appears on the Howling Stones in Twilight Princess, where we know the Sheikah play no role in the events of the kingdom. The presence of Sheikah symbols doesn't mean much.

&gt; Regardless, we know the Sheikah are around because the event that is implied to almost wiped them out hasn't occurred yet.

I'm not arguing that the Sheikah are not around at any of these points. I am arguing that we don't see them playing an important role in the events of the realm during these eras.

Impa's presence in games has no bearing on the current state of the Sheikah tribe. It only tells us that they are still around in some capacity - which does not help us with timeline placement."
32947,"It implies that the Sheikah *were* serving the Royal Family. We know that this is not the case during OoT.

And you're right - context is important. Without context, it would be easy to arrive at the conclusion that Impa's presence in the Downfall Timeline suggests that the Sheikah are actively serving the Royal Family. By considering the context of other games throughout the timeline, however, we can see that Impa's presence - as a servant of the Royal Family or otherwise - has no bearing on the current role of the Sheikah tribe.

This is the context that we must consider when attempting to use Impa or the Sheikah to infer timeline placement."
51784,"&gt; Sheikah are unseen in every game except Impa. The Impaz was the last of her tribe in TP and are nonexistent in the rest of the child and adult timelines. Therefore it would make sense for Downfall timeline because Impa is in every downfall title, and the Sheikah are now out of hiding because of the guardians they made 10k years ago. You can't really argue for Sheikah in the other timelines, they're extinct and there is no Impa either.

What? The Sheikah are not out of hiding in BotW. We only have Impa, the monk that have been stuck in the Shrines for years, and the Yiga Clan. We don't know what happened to the rest of the Sheikah.

And there is no evidence that the Sheikah are extinct the the Child Timeline. Impaz says that she is one of the last Sheikah - just like Impa does in OoT. However we know that the Sheikah do not go extinct after OoT. Why would we assume that they do after TP?

We also see the fewest signs of Sheikah culture in the Downfall Timeline. Even the games that were created after the Sheikah were introduced in OoT possess relatively few references to the Sheikah. Even the incarnations of Impa in this timeline are never explicitly stated to be Sheikah.

&gt; It's not really a moot point. The triforce is out of hands in the adult timeline and especially the child timeline. The downfall timeline is where everyone and their grandmother has touched it

It is a moot point because BotW exists 10,000 years after any other Zelda title. This is enough time for just about anything to occur. There is no reason that the Triforce could not be accessible to Zelda after all of this time.

&gt; The last point is more dubious. The stronger argument is the great deku tree. There is no deku tree in the child timeline, and there is no deku tree in adult timeline's new hyrule.

What evidence is there that the Deku Tree does not exist in the Child Timeline? Or the Fallen Timeline? We can't assume that he does not exist just because we never see him.  "
55808,"Let me address each of your responses to things I got ""wrong"":

&gt; Literally the entire Kakariko village in BotW are Sheikah people. The Sheikah all have white hair and red eyes. How could you overlook this simple detail? lo

Because I was paying attention.

Here are two quotes from the Old Man about the Sheikah:

""Long ago, an advanced civilization known as the Sheikah inhabited these lands.""

""But their civilization disappeared long ago...or so it is said.""

This is the King of Hyrule speaking here. He obviously knows about the residents of Kakariko. And yet, he speaks of the Sheikah tribe as an element of the distant past. The residents of Kakariko may have Sheikah DNA, but they no longer seem to play a role in protecting the Royal Family. The closest thing we see to this is some Sheikah helping reactivate the guardians.

If you were around when the Hylian text on the tapestry depicting the original sealing of Calamity Ganon was translated, you will remember that this texts states that the Sheikah tribe were banished after the sealing. This is why the Yiga Clan defected - they sided with Ganon as a form of retaliation.

Here is the translation:

“Hylians pass stories of a destined time long past, where multiple races lived and worked together in harmony. The Sheikah Tribe’s blue aura breathed through the land, and this mutual prosperity continued, until a cataclysmic disaster struck. The hero and the princess attempted in vain to seal the terror, which became known as the Calamity Ganon. Divine Beasts awoke from four directions, and deployed a mechanical army which made the king and his people fearful. They fractured Ganon’s power and sealed him… But the Sheikah were banished from the land ever since.”

This implies that the Sheikah we see in Kakariko have assimilated into Hylian culture. The tribe as we know it no longer exists.

&gt; Impa never says that in OoT, that's a common misconception. You can look it up, there is no such quote.

Ah, I was wrong in assuming that this information came from Impa. However, the game still heavily implies that the Sheikah are almost gone.

Here is a quote from a Gossip Stone:

""They say that Princess Zelda's nanny is actually one of the Sheikah, who many thought had died out.""

And then, Sheik describes herself/himself this way:

""I am Sheik. Survivor of the Sheikahs...""

So yeah, the Sheikah tribe are not around during OoT. This doesn't mean that they don't exist. But it does mean that they were not playing a role in the affairs on the kingdom. Only Impa had a role with the Royal Family.

&gt; Because it literally says it there. The Sheikah dwindled after prolonged wars, and only 1 member of the tribe remains in the old kakariko village. They also never reappear again in the timeline.

If you missed the point that the Sheikah were almost extinct in OoT, I can see why you would draw this conclusion. But, as I pointed out, the Sheikah *are* almost extinct during OoT. Just like they are in TP. But since we know the Sheikah were able to come back after OoT, there is no reason to assume that they will not after TP.

And when you say they never reappear again in the timeline, what you really mean is that they don't appear in FSA. This means nothing. The Sheikah don't appear in TMC either, and yet we know they did not go extinct. It doesn't make sense to point to one game where they do not appear and claim that they have gone extinct.

&gt; If you argue that Impa is not a Sheikah, then you are literally just arguing the Sheikah are gone in all timelines, which is a self-defeating argument that goes nowhere. Impa is Zelda's baby sitter in nearly every game, she's the same character every time she appears. She has red eyes, a dead giveaway for a Sheikah.

You misunderstood my point. I was saying that Sheikah culture is not referenced in the Downfall Timeline - so much so that the one member of the tribe that we do see is not even explicitly identified as a Sheikah. This does not mean that I don't think Impa is Sheikah. I merely demonstrating how Sheikah culture is strangely absent from the Downfall Timeline, compared to the overt references we see to Sheikah culture in the other timelines.

&gt; If you argue that Impa is not a Sheikah, then you are literally just arguing the Sheikah are gone in all timelines, which is a self-defeating argument that goes nowhere. Impa is Zelda's baby sitter in nearly every game, she's the same character every time she appears. She has red eyes, a dead giveaway for a Sheikah.

Again, I am not saying that the Downfall incarnations of Impa are not Sheikah.

What I *am* saying is that Impa's presence only tells us that the Sheikah still exist. Which is not useful information, because the only era in which they don't exist is the era after the creation of the Great Sea.

&gt; You're presenting a self-defeating argument again. 

You keep using that term, but I'm not sure that you know what it means. My argument that the Triforce can be owned by Zelda in any timeline because so much time has passed is not ""self-defeating"". What you mean is that this statement cannot be proven right or wrong - which is not what a ""self-defeating argument"" is. And the inability to prove or disprove an argument does not reduce its validity.

&gt; So wait. Even though we see Impa repeatedly, that doesn't mean the Sheikah exist. But we never see the Deku Tree and you ask me why I doubt he exists? You're just cherry picking assumptions to confirm your beliefs, instead of using evidence of what is actually present.

I already said that I do not believe the Downfall Impa's are not Sheikah.

With regard to the Deku Tree, as I said, his absence in some games does not mean he does not exist. Look at the Gerudo. They are present in OoT, absent in TP, and then present again in FSA. They obviously didn't go extinct in TP, even though we did not see them.
 "
59372,"The Old Man tells us that the Sheikah Tribe were an ancient race, and implies that they no longer exist.

Further, Hylian text on the tapestry depicting the original sealing of Calamity Ganon states that the Sheikah were banished after Calamity Ganon was sealed.

The residents of Kakariko are most likely just the descendents of what used to be the Sheikah tribe. They may be Sheikah, but they no longer play the role of defending the Royal Family. That - or they are mixed race Hylian/Sheikahs. Its not really clear."
102685,"&gt; Can I say that I appreciate the fact that there's literally a comment section argument and neither side Has descended in to just Curseing repeatedly

Well, so much for what u/erer99 said earlier. You may not be cursing, but you're acting like a child. And you weren't even mature enough to say this in response to me. I guess I should have seen it when you attempted to open with ""bunch of wrong things here"".

102917,"No, you're right. The gap between games is most likely larger than 10,000 years. It's just easier to say ""10,000 years"" because it's such a large gap anyway."
121116,"Lol okay kid. If you consider citing in-game textual evidence as believing in nonsense, then sure - I believe in nonsense.

I can tell you're not the most skilled debater. You resorted to petty insults very fast, and misused basic logic terms like ""self-defeating argument"".

If you're not able to back up your beliefs, or just not that experienced with these types of exchanges, you really shouldn't handle yourself this way. It makes it difficult to take you seriously, and it's just childish. And you'll never learn how to make a compelling argument.

Just some advice for you. But what do I know, I'm just the guy who ""believes in nonsense""..."
