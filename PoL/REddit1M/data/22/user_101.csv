1962863,"If no one has laid this out yet, the story has to be adult timeline. There's a stone monument that's part of the Zora Stone Monuments mission that talks about the legend of Zora Princess Ruto who helped the princess of Hyrule and hero of legend defeat Ganon. This alone proves that it was the adult timeline.

First, in the case of the fallen hero, they do not defeat Ganon and Ruto never helps the hero of legend. Second, in the case of the child timeline, Link and Zelda prevent Ganondorf from pulling off his invasion, so there is no Ganon to stop, and therefore Ruto does not help them. This leaves the adult Link timeline where Ruto does in fact help defeat Ganon.

The only thing that could poke holes in this is if Ruto survived long enough after Link and Zelda stopped or were defeated by Ganondorf in the either of the other timelines to be able to help seal Ganon in the timeline later on. It doesn't seem to be plausible for her to have helped link during her lifetime in the fallen hero timeline, but she is a sage who may be immortal, which is the next set of evidence. Of course this all hinges on what a Zora's lifetime is, which would have to be very long in the case of is being either timeline (but maybe sages are immortal. I would think so).

Another point of evidence is that the same monument says that Ruto became a sage after an evil force started to wreak disaster on Zora's Domain and to help the princess of Hyrule and hero of legend defeat Ganon. The only two timelines to have Ruto become a sage are the fallen hero and adult link timeline. The child timeline progresses through Majora's Mask and directly into Twilight Princess. I don't think the events that make her a sage even happen so I don't think she does. If she does, it's probably the strongest evidence against this theory. Even then, the sages change and sages may not be immortal, which strengthens my point. There may be evidence to this because one of Ruto's descendants is a sage in the future of the fallen hero timeline. But the Zora stone monument speaks specifically of Ruto so she would have to have descendants named after her, which the one spoken of previously isn't (her name is Oren from ALBW).

So all in all, I think that BotW falls in the adult link timeline, very far in the future. If anyone has any thoughts lemme know. I know I can be wrong somewhere and I'm not an expert on Zelda lore, but there's a lot of evidence pointing towards BotW being adult timeline."
