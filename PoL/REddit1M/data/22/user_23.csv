29074,"The one thing that people aren't talking about though... Ganon assumes his true form and forgets reincarnation completely, essientially meaning that Ganon is gone forever in whatever timeline this takes place.

And that the 5 pillars surrounding Hyrule Castle were to contain some type of guardians, and what's weird is that there's 1 normal guardian atop each pillar.

**Back on topic:** if we're taking the names of the divine beasts into consideration, then shouldn't the names of locations on the map count? ""Lake Saria"" ""Mido Swamp"" ""Darunia Lake"" ""Mikau Lake"" ""Mekar Lake"" (where did that e come from) ""Ruto Lake"" etc. But Mikau is from MM and Makar is from WW. Sure, the name of a location could just be an insignificant little detail, but I think the last one may be right, the timeline doesn't really matter for Breath of the Wild. Though that totally goes against everything we've ever known. lol"
