42037,"&gt;BotW doesn't take place in New Hyrule. Many of the landmarks are exclusive to the original Hyrule, including Death Mountain, Kakariko Village and Zora's Domain, which according to Arts and Artifacts, should become Dragon Roost Island after the flood.

We have confirmation that there have been multiple Kakariko Villages and Zora's Domains. TP confirms that the Hidden Village was the original Kakariko, and TP's Kakariko Village is a brand new place that reuses the old name. BotW tells us that its Zora's Domain was created 10,000 years ago, right around the time of the Great Calamity, but BotW also tells us that Ruto was a sage before the Great Calamity. Therefore BotW's Zora's Domain has to be a different place than OoT's Zora's Domain.

So we definitely can't use either of those places as proof that BotW takes place in Old Hyrule. (I haven't been to Death Mountain yet in BotW, so I can't say whether there's a possibility it may be a different place than OoT's Death Mountain, but since Zora's Domain is a new place, it wouldn't surprise me.)

Furthermore, the fact that BotW's Zora's Domain is a new place, that must mean that the old Zora's Domain was deserted or destroyed at some point, which could easily be a point in favor of BotW taking place after the flood.

&gt;Zelda alludes to the events of Twilight Princess in a speech anointing Link as a Champion.

I haven't yet seen that scene, but apparently right after this the other Champions start talking while Zelda continues her speech, in which she mentions something about traveling over the seas, which is as close to being a TWW reference as her mention of twilight is a reference to TP. So if this is true and she references both TP and TWW, that must mean that either Nintendo is giving up on the idea of the split timeline and re-evaluating the story of OoT so that there isn't a split, or the references in her speech can't be taken as references to any specific games.

&gt;Ganon has been fought multiple times in this timeline (twice, that we know of), which is something that Aonuma said was a prerequisite for BotW's timeline placement.

Aonuma's quote was, ""As you probably saw in the trailer, the most recent trailer, there's a woman's voice, and she says: ""The history of the royal family of Hyrule is also the history of the Calamity Ganon."" And as you know, the Zelda series, up until now, is a history of repeated attacks by Ganon. So, there's food for thought there. I don't want to say anything more as I'd like players to work it out for themselves, to play the game and see what they think.""

So Aonuma is just referring to Impa's quote, not necessarily that Hyrule has been attacked by different Ganons multiple times or anything like that. In BotW we're told that Ganon attacked Hyrule 10,000 years ago, then 100 years ago, and is now attacking again in the present, so regardless of what timeline BotW belongs to, we see multiple Ganon attacks.

&gt;The Sheikah are thriving--which is oddly only depicted in the Downfall Timeline. Evidenced by the fact that in Downfall games Impa is consistently apart of the story.

The Sheikah aren't really depicted as thriving in any game in the series before BotW. LoZ Impa and Oracles Impa are not confirmed to be Sheikah (though Oracles Impa does feature the red eyes and white hair despite being young that most Sheikah have). And OoT tells us that it was believed that all of the Sheikah were wiped out during the fierce war that happened right before OoT. In TP we meet Impaz, who is a Sheikah descendant of Impa, but she mentions that most of her tribe was wiped out during the prolonged wars that occurred between OoT and TP. Before BotW, we had never seen more than one Sheikah present in a game, so it's hard to say they were actually thriving at any point post-OoT.

&gt;The whole Triforce being in the hands of the Royal Family and passed down to heirs is a predominantly Downfall Timeline trope.

If we're using evidence from Hyrule Historia, it says that the Royal Family has the whole Triforce in FSA, so even though the trope points toward Downfall, the Triforce being present could allow for it to occur in any of the timelines (though Adult would be the least likely since we don't know what happened to the Triforce after TWW; we just know it's possible the Royal Family could have come to repossess it at some point).

&gt;The Hero fought and defeated Ganondorf in BotW's past. This didn't happen in the Downfall, since the Hero died in battle.

This shouldn't be used as a piece of evidence against, because we know the Great Calamity happened many years after OoT. (The Zora slab that confirms Ruto was once a Zora sage who fought off Ganon says that this event happened in an age long before the Great Calamity or the creation of the Divine Beasts.) The hero from the Great Calamity has no known connection to OoT Link.

&gt;Everything we know about the Rito says they should not exist in a universe containing both Zora and Zora's Domain

I don't see any reason to assume this since we've seen two different lines of Zora existing at the same time in OoA, and now we've seen two different lines of Sheikah existing at the same time in BotW. It's possible that not all the Zora were transformed into Rito. It's also possible that Zora who weren't native to Hyrule eventually moved there and established the new Zora's Domain after the Zora who had been native to Hyrule transformed into Rito."
