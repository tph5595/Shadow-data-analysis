28329,"I like to think that it's the child timeline, but the stuff with Ruto and nabooru was just kind of an overlooked detail by the creators since they knew the game took place after OOT, but didn't consider that all of the events didn't take place.

Who knows though. How long does it usually take for them to place a new Zelda game on the timeline? "
35867,"That's what I mean kinda... They only really do it for the fans. Like sure, they made skyward sword with the timeline in mind, but they also made it take place so far back I'm the timeline that they had a lot of freedom with designing the game and story. 


Also, they didn't really have the timeline in mind for wind waker. They just had it reference OOT as a prequel. So did a few other games, and the whole timeline split was their cop-out in order to explain discrepancies. "
