49462,"1. Sheikah are unseen in every game except Impa. The Impaz was the last of her tribe in TP and are nonexistent in the rest of the child and adult timelines. Therefore it would make sense for Downfall timeline because Impa is in every downfall title, and the Sheikah are now out of hiding because of the guardians they made 10k years ago. You can't really argue for Sheikah in the other timelines, they're extinct and there is no Impa either.

2. It's not really a moot point. The triforce is out of hands in the adult timeline and especially the child timeline. The downfall timeline is where everyone and their grandmother has touched it.

3. The last point is more dubious. The stronger argument is the great deku tree. There is no deku tree in the child timeline, and there is no deku tree in adult timeline's new hyrule."

&gt; What? The Sheikah are not out of hiding in BotW. We only have Impa, the monk that have been stuck in the Shrines for years, and the Yiga Clan. We don't know what happened to the rest of the Sheikah.

Literally the entire Kakariko village in BotW are Sheikah people. The Sheikah all have white hair and red eyes. How could you overlook this simple detail? lol

&gt; And there is no evidence that the Sheikah are extinct the the Child Timeline. Impaz says that she is one of the last Sheikah - just like Impa does in OoT. However we know that the Sheikah do not go extinct after OoT. 

Impa never says that in OoT, that's a common misconception. You can look it up, there is no such quote.

&gt;Why would we assume that they do after TP?

Because it literally says it there. The Sheikah dwindled after prolonged wars, and only 1 member of the tribe remains in the old kakariko village. They also never reappear again in the timeline.

&gt; We also see the fewest signs of Sheikah culture in the Downfall Timeline. Even the games that were created after the Sheikah were introduced in OoT possess relatively few references to the Sheikah. Even the incarnations of Impa in this timeline are never explicitly stated to be Sheikah.

If you argue that Impa is not a Sheikah, then you are literally just arguing the Sheikah are gone in all timelines, which is a self-defeating argument that goes nowhere. Impa is Zelda's baby sitter in nearly every game, she's the same character every time she appears. She has red eyes, a dead giveaway for a Sheikah.

&gt;It is a moot point because BotW exists 10,000 years after any other Zelda title. This is enough time for just about anything to occur. There is no reason that the Triforce could not be accessible to Zelda after all of this time.

You're presenting a self-defeating argument again. You basically say it can be any timeline, which goes nowhere and makes you neither right or wrong.

&gt;What evidence is there that the Deku Tree does not exist in the Child Timeline? Or the Fallen Timeline? We can't assume that he does not exist just because we never see him.

So wait. Even though we see Impa repeatedly, that doesn't mean the Sheikah exist. But we never see the Deku Tree and you ask me why I doubt he exists? You're just cherry picking assumptions to confirm your beliefs, instead of using evidence of what is actually present."
