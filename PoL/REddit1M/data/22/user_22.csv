28872,"10,000 years might not be literal. In Japan using the number 10,000 to describe something is roughly the same thing as saying ""a really really long time"" kind of like how kids here might say ""a million"" or ""a bajillion"" or some variant when they just mean a really big number.

So it might not have been 10,000 years ago. Maybe it was only a couple thousand. Maybe it was 50,000. Whatever it is it's long enough for them to use their equivalent term of ""a really long time"" when they describe it."
29559,Names of landmarks shouldn't be used as evidence since they're most likely just easter eggs put in by Nintendo. We have to assume the landmarks aren't proof unless we get someone in game stating that Linebeck Island was named after an actual person named Linebeck.
29694,Have fun placing Twilight Princess or any of the downfall games in your singular timeline then. They can't take place before WW since it's very clearly stated that there was no hero during that time and they can't take place after WW since Hyrule was left flooded and everyone moved to a new continent.
29816,"And yet Rito and Koroks don't exist in the downfall timeline. Plus Zelda herself directly references Twilight Princess.

There's evidence for all 3. A convergence makes the most sense."
31924,Yup. Plus Linebeck didn't have his spelling changed at all which invalidates /u/woznito's spelling explanation.
32051,"I know, I'm just using them as an example to show that just because we've only seen Lynels in the downfall timeline doesn't mean they can't exist in other timelines."
36082,"Do the people of Hyrule have a legend about the real life person Satoru Iwata for which they named Satori Mountain after? Landmark names are mostly easter eggs. Not all of them are, like anything named after Din, Nayru, Farore, and Hylia. But I'm not going to say that Linebeck Island is definitive proof that Linebeck existed in BOTW's past. It just means Nintendo referenced him.

The only way to reconcile all the landmark names is for this to take place in a converged timeline of all three timelines. I actually like that idea quite a bit and it's the one I support the most. But if it's not a converged timeline then my money is on it being the child timeline in which Linebeck never existed. "
40963,"Yes, but that doesn't mean it's not still a reference to Mr. Iwata. 

If my last name was something like Harmon and then I died and the game company I was the president of added a ""Harmony Mountain"" into the next game they released with a spiritual guardian named ""Harmony"" that is said to be the reincarnation of someone that died then I would consider that to be a direct reference to me. Just because harmony is a real word doesn't invalidate that."
