17995,"I can't help but wonder why everyone assumes it impossible that the Sages in Twilight Princess (though veiled) could not possibly be Nabooru &amp; Ruto. They were obviously both predestined to become Sages plus we already know the Zora have long lifespans -- who's to say Nabooru wouldn't have lived long enough to also become a Sage as well, considering we don't even have an estimate on the Gerudo life-expectancy.

A result of them being those Sages would clearly place their paths in helping Link and Zelda defeat Ganon in the Child Timeline.

Ruto, being Sage of Water, would have perished attempting to seal Ganon, however, that doesn't take away the fact that she'd assisted in defeating Ganon.

I just cannot see any possibility that BoTW takes place in the Adult Timeline... and Downfall, while it could be there, has a lot of inconsistencies -- a lot more than the few from the Child Timeline, which can pretty easily be explained from the 10,000 year gap."
