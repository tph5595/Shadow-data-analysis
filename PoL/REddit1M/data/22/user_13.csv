22990,"I feel its set WAY MORE than 10,000 years after OoT.

When you read the Zora Monument mentioning the Divine Beasts being named after the sage Ruto, it specifically says ""ages after"" in reference to when it was built in comparison to Ruto helping to seal away Ganon.

This was written by a Zora as well who have much longer lifespans than Hylians (who appear to have similar lifespans to humans), so the term ""ages"" might mean a lot longer time than it does for us.

As for the Zora thing in Downfall Timeline, there are friendly Zora in the Oracle games and Link saves the Zora Queen in A Link Between Worlds. The monuments in BotW also make mention of an alliance between the Zora and Hylians once the Hylians helped them with their ""superior technology"" to build the resevoir. This alludes that they did not have the same relationship they had in OoT times... Perhaps even hostile?

It could perhaps be related to the event that is mentioned in the Sage Princess Ruto monument, where an ""evil man with designs to rule the world"" (it seems they don't know this was Ganon) laid a curse on Zora's Domain. This could refer to one of two things, Jabu-Jabu's curse or Zora's Domain freezing over. Either way, the Zora could blame the Hylian Royal Family for not stopping the evil man. Of course that is just an assumption.

Last tidbit, as for map comparisons, BotW is most like aLttP/aLBW maps. Just about every major thing lines up (Death Mountain, Lake Hylia, Zora's Domain, and Lost Woods) and of wanted to assume a few things Ludfo's Bog lines up with the Swamp, Lanaryu Prominade Lines up with the Eastern Palace and the Desert of Mystery lines up with the Rito Village. The last one is a longshot connection, but both are in completely walled off. Areas and 10,000 years is definitely long enough for it to fill up with water."
