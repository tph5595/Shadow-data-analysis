34953,"&gt;The Hero fought and defeated Ganondorf in BotW's past. This didn't happen in the Downfall, since the Hero died in battle.

Ok, this is going to be a little bit of a stretch, but hear me out. If we assume for a second that Ganondorf and Ganon aren't classed as the same, then it's completely plausable to say the hero defeated **Ganondorf**. If in the downfall timeline, if the hero of time managed to defeat Ganondorf, but then was defeated by **Ganon**, you could still argue that the hero defeated **Ganondorf** but not **Ganon**.

Alternatively the hero defeated timeline could have been caused by the events which followed the slaying of Ganon, where Ganon used the last of his power to attempt to destroy the castle with Link and Zelda in it. Link could have simply been crushed by the castle, then Ganon was able to survive by using the power of the triforce of courage which rested within Link."
