24639,"There is an assumption running around and I don't know why. This assumption being that things happening in the adult time line couldn't happen in the child time line. Mostly, why can't Rito exist in the child time line? Why can't sages be awaken in the child time line? The reasons those things happened in the adult time line don't negate other plausible causes in other circumsantes for the same consequences."
24982,"But the evidence don't suggest a concrete non-awakeing, meaning that mentions of the sages can't disprove the child time line. They just can't fuel that time line until proven otherwise, which is different."
28145,"My point was not to bring attention to ""ifs"" and such. Sorry for not being clear enough. What I meant to point at is when an evidence doesn't support a theory, it doesn't mean that it goes against it. Therefore one can't say that for example BotW doesn't take place in the child time line because Rito exist. Rito existing do support the adult time line, but they don't unprove the child time line."
29790,"True, but it's not even evidence against, because it doesn't go against."
32447,"Rito were just an example I saw brought up a lot. We can't reach an answer if we use wrong facts. If we assume some evidences are inconsistent, then we miss pieces to solve the puzzle. In this case yes, some evidence for should also be discussed. We should be sure to have the right pieces first, by disscussing each evidence one by one."
46305,"Well in that case, if their are sages from the ""same generation"" as Rauru, mentions of the sages we know doact as evidence against the child time line."
