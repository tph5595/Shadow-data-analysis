65485,"More evidence against downfall: At the end of LttP, the Master Sword is said to go to sleep forever.  Unless this is somehow retconed out, no future Zelda games shown in the Hyrule Hystoria contain the Master Sword.  That means BotW would need to be before LttP, and there are no massive towers, shrines, or other high tech remnants of BotW to be seen in any fallen timeline entries.

Evidence for the Child timeline: Outside of the game, so to speak, graphics were updated in TP HD that better reflect BotW's races.

More Child timeline: Link is right handed which only happened in SS, and in the Child timeline, even FS:HA.  There is some art for Zelda I that shows Link holding a sword in his right hand, but most show left.  He is left handed for all Adult timeline games that I have seen, and 90% of the artwork in the fallen timeline.

66748,"Good point, for some reason I remembered LBW being before LttP, so that part is out via retcon.  

Link being right handed is a big Child Timeline indicator though.  I think the carving update in TP HD shows Nintendo's ""intent"" for BotW placement.  Otherwise, why bother?"
