8168,"If I had to choose one of the timelines it would be this one. There's a line in BotW about Calamity Ganon that said it is the manifestation of a great power that gave up reincarnation to assume it's current form (can't remember the exact quote).

I think Ganon (or rather Demise's spirit I guess) got so fed up with the constant reincarnations and deaths/revivals of the downfall timeline that he said fuck this and went all-in for one last attempt to take over."
