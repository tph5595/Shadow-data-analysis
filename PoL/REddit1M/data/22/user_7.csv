I kinda found it a poetic thought considering how much BotW took the best of all those games and packed it into a new adventure."

I know this gets into the territory of ""could have happened,"" but I always wondered if, for example, Ruto; Nobooru, and the others awoke as sages later in life in the child timeline. It's implied OoT Link went on to become a gifted soldier in his own right, which always spoke to me that there were still external threats in the world he lived in."
