54898,"I dont think it's fair to say that not taking place in New Hyrule is evidence against the Adult Timeline.

It's been 10,000 years (more, likely) since a Ganon attack. Which itself could have been many many years after the last one that there was actually a game about (Wind Waker). It could be 20,000 years since then, and that's a long time in any context, let alone that of a fantasy land. The sea could have subsided for any number of reasons. Maybe the sword was removed from Ganondorf's head in the events of some other fantasy epic that we just don't know about because it hasn't been chronicled by a game (yet). Link himself (a past one) may have had to retrieve it from the bottom of the ocean.

I'm not saying it is necessarily the most plausible solution but I think it's silly to discount the adult timeline for these reasons."
