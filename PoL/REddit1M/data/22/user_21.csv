28372,"Adult-timeliner here to say that I believe this is the Child timeline. 

1. Of course, Zelda specifically mentions the Hero of the Sky, Time, and Twilight. It would be boring if this was my only evidence.

2. Something no one has mentioned is the location names. You will notice locations with the names of prominent characters from OoT (Mt. Rauru, Darunia Lake, Saria, Mido, etc.) as well as Twilight Princess (Rutella Lake and Ralis Lake). 

3. These names are the exact same as the mentioned individual.

4. ""But woznito, what about Mekar Lake, Mt. Daphnes, and Vah Medoh?""

5. This game certainly references characters from the Adult timeline, but it purposely changes their names so it is not the same. (i.e. Makar to Mekar, Medly to Medoh, Tingle (and his brothers) to Tingel, etc.) 

6. As for Daphnes, it is very safe to assume that considering Hyrule is a Royal Family, he would have taken over at one point and is thus present in all three timelines. The changing of the names for Adult characters, but not for Child, means something for sure.
