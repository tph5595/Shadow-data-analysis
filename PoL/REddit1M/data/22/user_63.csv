53775,"According to the backstory of TP and the Child timeline in general, Ganondorf was due to be executed by the spirits of the past sages after the events of OoT, but was saved at the last minute by the Triforce of Power. Realising they wouldn't be able to kill him, the sages used the Mirror of Twilight to banish him. This means that the Mirror of Twilight, and the Twilight Realm itself, originated long before Ocarina of Time, and so exists in all timelines. "

Zelda's speech mentions the master sword ""steeped in the glowing embers of twilight""; no mention of fighting mutated Twili, Ganondorf's corruption, or anything other than some vague interaction with the Twilight Realm.
