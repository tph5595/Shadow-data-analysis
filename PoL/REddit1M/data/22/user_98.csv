It could possibly be a type of glowing stone and we've seen in Botw that  this kind of rock exists with the luminous stones that we can find basically everywhere.
I'm not saying both are the same but both glow, both are circular (and really look like each other http://zelda.gamepedia.com/Mirror_of_Twilight), both were shattered into shards.
If you want to prove those aren't the same you have to provide better arguments than the ones you gave."
