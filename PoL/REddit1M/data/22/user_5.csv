10384,"I dont remember Nabooru being named as a ""sage"" exactly. Princess Ruto was though in the zora tablets, more importantly the tablet states she was a sage long before the events of 10,000 years ago. That puts this game's back story far after ocarina, meaning the Divine beasts were not piloted by their namesakes. BotW is almost certainly not Adult timeline. I would say Downfall, but Zelda's speech specifically mentions Twilight. That conflicts with Ruto being a sage though. Unless you think about how the sage that Ganondoff killed in TP was the Sage of Water... I don't know. There is too much of a mixture of Downfall/ Child timeline lore in the game."
