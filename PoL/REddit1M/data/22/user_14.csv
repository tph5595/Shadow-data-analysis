23438,"Remember when Wind Waker came out, and we didn't have all of these contradictory and complicated ""Official"" timelines, and it was just assumed that after OoT, Link went off in search of Navi, entered Termina, and never came back, leading to an unopposed Ganon, leading to the flooding of Hyrule?

I still refuse to accept an ""official"" timeline where this doesn't happen."
