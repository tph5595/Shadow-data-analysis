59774,"Not to mention Ganon's final, and truest, form at the end has the tagline ""Hatred and Malice Incarnate."" Plus he looks much more ethereal than past ""Ganon"" (read: large pig) forms. The more I think of it, the less I see any Ganon in this Ganon. I think after millennia of reincarnation people forgot about Demise and the name Ganon just stuck."
