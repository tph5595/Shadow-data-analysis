5472,"&gt; Breath of the Wild is 10,000 years post-Ocarina. Any number of events could have occurred in that time.

I feel like I should bring this up as I've seen this repeated. So far as we know, this is 10,000 years post-last-time-they-saw-*Calamity-Ganon*, not even Ganondorf. The mention of Guardians, Divine Beasts, Champions, etc, that all happened 10,000 years ago, but it *didn't* happen in Ocarina of Time (quite obviously, as you mentioned).

Considering Ganon is referred to in that legend as Calamity Ganon rather than Ganon, Ganondorf, the King of Evil, or his other titles, I think the first event that happened 10,000 years ago happened sometime *after* all of the games we've played thus far. So, Twilight Princess A.D. + 10,100 years."
33676,"&gt; BOTW itself outright says ""Ruto was a sage"", which outright says ""This isn't child timeline"", and all the other examples in the OP.

Honestly, I expect even in the Child Timeline which includes Twilight Princess that the Sages still awoke as Sages, just as Link was still the Hero of Time even if they were able to prevent the events of Ocarina of Time. They just wouldn't have been awakened in that manner."
33950,"This is something that really intrigues me. I'm reading up on Dragon Breaks now, and some key points here:

&gt; At the end of a Dragon Break, the timeline reconnects making all possibilities and outcomes truth, though contradictory to each other.

Yes, hello ""Hyrule was once under a Great Sea and now it's not""...

&gt; After being affected by a break, most people are prone to forget the event ever even occurred, dismissing it off as nonsensical, despite intense feelings of spiritual anguish they can not account for.

I honestly feel like the Merged Timeline theory is my favorite. That all roads point to Breath of the Wild where events from all three have come together with some having happened and others have not or contradicting one another, and it all happened *so long ago* that no one remembers any of those contradictory facts."
34492,"&gt; essientially meaning that Ganon is gone forever in whatever timeline this takes place.

This is what I had thought as well until someone pointed out to me that Zelda described her power as a ""Sealing Power"". Despite the big flashy lights, I fully expect Ganon was merely sealed again (the end of the animation kind of makes it look like the light consumed/enveloped Calamity Ganon and then vanished like a closing door/portal to another realm)."
34548,"&gt; We know for sure Ocarina of Time occurred. That's about it. 

It could be reasonably argued that Twilight Princess also happened, per Zelda's prayer in the first memory."
34787,"According to two separate wikis that mention it being clarified in the Hyrule Historia:

&gt; Once a famed swordsman of Hyrule, he is, according to the Hyrule Historia, the Hero of Time from Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask that died lamenting that he was never remembered as a hero, as well as not passing down his skills to the next generation.

Regardless of whether the events of the Adult Timeline took place, that link is still considered the ""Hero of Time"" because the events *did* happen for that Link. He did go forward in time and awoke the sages and sealed Ganondorf, and then returned to the past."
