41544,"Breath of the Wild takes place after Twilight Princess. I understand the ""But 'dem Koroks!"" argument, but the Koroks (in this time line apparently) took longer to evolve and so didn't exist until after Twilight Princess.

Any my main reason for placing it after that game is the Master Sword. It's still the Light Sword, which was first created in Twilight Princess, but is now weaker. The light fades with use, so it still has the power, but after all this time (undetermined amount) the Light needs to recharge after so much use.

I have tried to place it before or after Four Swords Adventures, but since nothing from that game is ever mentioned I can only assume out takes place before.

So now we wait for Nintendo to prove me right. :)"
111026,"The Master Sword glowing with light isn't the Light Sword. During the events of Twilight Princess the Master Sword was upgraded by liberating two Sols within the Palace of Twilight. Apparently this upgrade still exists in Breath of Wild, but needs to recharge. The evidence for this is from the words used by the Great Deku Tree and the fact that the light needs to recharge.

Anyway, I'm pretty sure this'll be confirmed in the future. I just don't know when. Whenever Nintendo decides to finally talk about it..."
116215,I am still gathering evidence. And Ruto being a Sage is perfectly acceptable in the Twilight Princess Timeline. It takes place after Ocarina of Time... so... no conflict.
