33733,"As mentioned in OPs post, Zelda references Twilight Princess, a story which does not happen in any other timeline outside of the Child Timeline. "
34523,"After she *directly says* The Master Sword has seen Skyward battles and been through time? It seems like **way** too big of a flag to just ignore because of some salt collectibles or town names. 

The fact of the matter is that the game could more than likely slide into any timeline's future, but the Child timeline seems most plausible because of the game's story directly referencing past ventures."
34901,"Daria, Darunia, Ruto, Impa and Nabooru were always destined to become Sages. Where was it said they wouldn't be? Link only had to awaken them because they were trapped by Ganon's power."
35561,"&gt;will call those **DESTINED** to be Sages.

Meaning it's their purpose to seal Ganon from the moment they're conceived in the exact same way Link and Zelda are destined to inherit the Triforce of Courage and Wisdom, respectively. "

Regardless of the outcome if they sealed Ganon and he world flooded, or executed him or sealed him at full power; those 6 were the only Sages of that era. Why we don't see their forms in TP, I don't know, stylistic choice I guess, but Rauru, Saria, Darunia, Ruto, Impa and Nabooru were the only Sages at that time, so their role needed to be fulfilled regardless of the outcome; sealing or execution."
41736,"No, it seemed to pre-date TP and was present during the era of the Hero of Time, so it's safe to assume that the Arbiter's Grounds were around even before OoT. "
60670,"As I understand it, the Ancient Sages guard the Arbiter's Grounds and The Mirror of Twilight while the Seven Sages guard the Sacred Realm. "
