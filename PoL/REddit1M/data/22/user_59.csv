49314,"With how often names are reused in Hyrule, I'd say taking a name and nothing more as evidence of anything is a questionable move.  Shiekahs certainly love reusing the name Impah or Impa or Impaz. We flat out know that the Royal Family almost always names their daughters Zelda regardless of how much spiritual power they have.  Maybe Darunia is a name that just ends up being used by a lot of Goron Chieftains? So you end up with a situation kind of like royalty where you have Darunia First of his Name, Darunia II, Darunia XIV etc. Except they drop the numerals because they're Gorons and they don't give a shit for all that formal crap.

Frankly, I'd say the team didn't give much thought for timeline continuity when they were building this game. Doing things like making a ""Linebeck island"" and adding in a carbon copy of the OoT LonLon Ranch certainly suggests to me that trying to care about a cohesive timeline in this series is a waste of everyone's time, because the dev team certainly didn't care.

Hell the timeline is now so broken that we're having to bring up Dragon Breaks from the elder scrolls. I mean, I do LOVE that idea, but its just evidence to me that Nintendo treats the timeline as literally an afterthought. And I don't mean afterthought as in ""lets think about this in the last month before release"". I mean afterthought as in ""we released a month ago....oh right there's supposed to be a timeline""."

And to sell what was essentially an artbook."

I believe we're at that moment now."
