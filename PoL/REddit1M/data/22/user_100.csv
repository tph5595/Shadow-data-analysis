1201359,The Child/Adult split has been real since the Wind Waker intro fired up and was generally accepted as canon. It was trying to make everything else fit that made things more convoluted.  
1201943,"I had had this same thought when reading the main topic, but I talked myself out of it mainly because in the successful ending to OoT, Ganon and Ganondorf get sealed together as a packaged deal and Ganondorf reemerges in Wind Waker. It would make some sort of sense if the essence of Ganon ditched its host (assuming there was a Yuga-Ganon type relationship) and somehow attacked Link, I suppose. But then why would Ganon need to utilize Ganondorf's body to assume physical form?"
