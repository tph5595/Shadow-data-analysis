40133,"I don't know if this is in the English version but in the German version Zelda not only mentioned the Hero of Time but also the Hero who travelled the sea in the ceremony. However New Hyrule is completely different from the original Hyrule so there seems to be another timeline split after Wind Waker where the Link from WW founded New Hyrule while the sea of WW disappeared. 
I for one believe that BotW is happening more than 100,000 years in the future where things from one timeline also happened in another timeline. Calamity Ganon is not Ganon anymore but more like the accumulation of evil and hatred without any mind or soul."
