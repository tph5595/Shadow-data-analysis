57870,"The time between the last Zelda game and the first Calamity makes the most sense in Downfall and Child timeline, as Ganon was sealed away at the latest installment in those two.



Ganon/Ganondorf must have broken free of wherever he was vanished in order to cause a first Calamity. The game seems to be pretty vague when it comes to details to the first Calamity and most of the knowledge seems to be passed down as folklore. 


If the Calamity happened during a time when Hyrule was enjoying a technological golden age and Ganons threat was still something fresh in the memory of people it can't have happened more than a few hundred years after Twilight Princess. Then looking at the 10,000 year span they mention, all kinds of things could have happened in Hyrule ecologically to cause a reference to a great Sea and once buried artifacts now being uncovered. They could have just experienced a warming of their world and thus lowlands would have been flooded, once their world started cooling the receding waters would probably have uncovered the remains of ages past and would also explain why there are Leviathan bones scattered in the northern and western part of the map.

What bothers me though is how he came back, as if they were expecting him to come back once the machines were uncovered. It could mean it was known to the king 100 years prior that a faction was working to bring back Ganon or he knew how and where Ganon was sealed and that it was weakening it's grip on him as time passed. Weirder still is the fact that Ganon seems to have arisen straight from Hyrule Castle itself in the flashback, why would Ganon himself come back at Hyrule Castle and not at the location where he was last sealed (i.e Mirrors of Twilight)?"
