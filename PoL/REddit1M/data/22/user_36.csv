33996,"It may be irrelevent. But the manga of skyward sword in hyrule hystoria makes mention of the original Link. (one that came before Skyward Sword's incarnation)

The opening of Skyward sword shows that the little robot tribe assisted Hylia in sealing demise. Which means they fought alongside this original Link. The sentry guardians kind of look like these little robots.


*note the little robot tribe is also powered by blue energy.

Perhaps the legend referered to in BOTW is simply that of the original Link. We know he had the Master Sword (Hyrule Hystoria). There was the Princess (Hylia). And who is to say that the guardians we know of now were simply not seen in SS.
Afterall the king did say they were buried underground. And in Skyward sword we saw alot of deactivated robots in the Mines.

Maybe the original Calamity Ganon is Demise himself. And later after ten thousand years passed, after the events of the CT or DFT. Calamity Ganon rose once more as Demise's Hatred."
