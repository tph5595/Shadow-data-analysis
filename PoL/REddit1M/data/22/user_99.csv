799377,"I'm fairly certain BotW exists in the Child Timeline, but it runs parallel with events that occur in the Downfall Timeline, hence why there are similarities with Downfall Timeline aesthetics/locations.  

My theory is that BotW occurs in the same time period as the original Legend of Zelda and Link's Adventure in the Downfall Timeline; however, BotW occurs in the *Child* Timeline.  This is why a lot of the aesthetics feel the same in BotW as they do from both original NES games, but why so many of the peoples and races and locations exist from Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess.  BotW mentions events that occurred 10,000 years in the past where a hero, princess, and a bunch of guardians helped to stop Ganon.  This would correlate in the same time as it would in the Downfall Timeline with Link to the Past, since we know LttP occurs before the NES Zelda games in the Downfall Timeline.  

Child Timeline:
--- BotW 10,000 years past events --- BotW itself
--- Link to the Past --- Legend of Zelda / Link's Adventure"
