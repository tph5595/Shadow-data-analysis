31779,"&gt; that no matter the timeline, they all resulted in the same outcome that Ganon finally let go of his attempts at resurrection and instead went on to become the calamitous manifestation 

Fair enough, but to believe that this is ""the latest in each timeline"" you have to completely ignore the fact that things from the other two timelines also objectively happened in this one. 

The idea that all 3 games could end up with BOTW happening is a neat one for sure, but BOTW itself outright says ""Ruto was a sage"", which outright says ""This isn't child timeline"", and all the other examples in the OP. It's can't possibly be an ending thread to all 3, because it outright states events from the other two happened."
31924,"&gt; What people may not think of is whatever Link told Zelda at the ending of OoT/the beginning of the Child timeline. It's completely possible that Link recounted every part of his adventure to Zelda

No, it's not. This is the basis for the Hero's Shade. No one in Hyrule in the child timeline knew what happened in the adult timeline, which lead to Link not being recognized as a hero, which lead to him going sort of nuts. If Link had told Zelda ll this, and Zelda had recorded it in Hyrule's history, the Hero's Shade situation would not have happened. Ergo, we know that Link's story of ""here's what happened"" was **not** publicized."
33972,"Link *wasn't* the hero of time in the child timeline. Link's actions as an adult were not acknowledged in the child timeline. That's the entire basis for the Hero's Shade.

The thing with ruto also says she helped defeat ganon. Which could not happen in the child timeline, as Ganondorf was executed."
35630,"okay, and that's completely irrelevant to the conversation, which is about how other people in the child timeline *did not know that*"
43569,He obviously told Zelda. It is canon that he told zelda. This is how Zelda knows to stop ganondorf and convinces her father to execute him. But they didn't tell *anyone else.*
