70360,"This makes me think that the ""10,000 years ago"" that they mention in the game is the very first battle with Demise, pre-Skyward Sword.  The Sheikah may have been the ones who created the ancient robots and, with the same technology, the Guardians.  Like the Gobekli Tribe, maybe they buried the shrines and Guardians to preserve them.
The time gap also explains the name 'Calamity Ganon,' something we've never heard before.  Over those 10K years, the word Demise might've been translated to the word Calamity, as language would certainly have changed in that time.
That makes things a lot easier for placement in the timeline.  We can think of BotW as 100+ years after other games instead of a mind boggling 10,100+ years after."
70709,I believe the Sheikah have red eyes as well.  Have to do an eye exam in Kakariko next time I play...
71407,"Food for thought: what if Kakariko Village is considered its own autonomous nation?  ""But the Sheikah were banished from the land ever since"" could mean that they were banished from all territory under control of Hyrule; perhaps Kakariko is where they were banished to.
It would make sense, since Kakariko is kind of tucked away in the mountains, under the protection of the great fairy, and seems to be self-sufficient.  Of course, after Hyrule fell, no one was there to enforce the banishment (although there is still a stigma: the kids in Hateno are spying on the laboratory because they saw a Sheikah girl there).
The King also says ""But their civilization disappeared long ago...or so it is said."" Kinda like a *hint hint* because he knows very well that they're still around, but it's not common knowledge (the Sheikah are a sneaky people)

71806,The Zora change a lot.  From the seahorse thingy's in SS to Zora to Rito.  I think that change could have come about in a number of different ways.
77207,"Hmm, I see. Do you know where I can find the text of the monuments? I tried Google, but just found walkthroughs"
