1119,"For Downfall, don't forget

* The Sheikah are thriving--which is oddly only depicted in the Downfall Timeline. Evidenced by the fact that in Downfall games Impa is consistently apart of the story. And the manual of Zelda II even references Impa coming from a lineage of lorekeepers who serve the Royal Family.

* The whole Triforce being in the hands of the Royal Family and passed down to heirs is a predominantly Downfall Timeline trope.

* Lost Woods and Master Sword are in the north like in A Link to the Past"

In SS, the Sheikah are simply unseen and Impa is the only Sheikah that is crucial to the story. The Surface is a vast and mysterious place. We know there are more than just Impa because the tribe eventually comes to serve the royal family and it is highly speculated that during the Era of Chaos, a faction of them became the Dark Interlopers from TP's backstory. 

In Ocarina of Time, we see Impa and she mentions she's among the last of her tribe.

In Twilight Princess, Impaz is the last Sheikah. Perhaps not racially as Fanadi seems to be of Sheikah-descent, but she's the last of the organized Sheikah society. Also at one point,  Gor Coron says that the tribe that protected the Royal Family of Hyrule ""dwindled in the prolonged wars."" To me at least, this evidences that during the Hyrulean Civil War most Sheikah were killed defending Hyrule. This aligns with Impa being among the last of her people. Prolonged Wars, however, also may imply more wars. Perhaps including the Interloper War and the speculated Hylian-Gerudo War. So basically, we can deduce that in the CT the Sheikah are almost extinct.

In the Adult Timeline, we see absolute no sign of the Sheikah outside their symbol and an artifact that may have been created by them. It seems, if the Sheikah are still around, Tetra and WW Link never met them and reincorporated them into New Hyrule.

In the Downfall Timeline, we have the most depictions of the Sheikah and have consistently seen them serving the royal family and serving as lore keeper. In fact, the Sheikah (through Impa) appear in OoX, ALBW, LoZ, and AoL. 


...Also if 10,000 year gap can account for the Triforce being used in a way specific to the Downfall Timeline then the 10,000 year gap can also account for the ""in the embers of Twilight"" quote. Who's not to say a DT Twilight event happened in those 10,000 years."
29066,"The Gorons exist in Labrynna and Holodrum. They could have immigrated back like the friendly Zora. To me, it's implied that after the Imprisoning War there was an exodus of non-human species from Hyrule."
29603,What inconsistencies are there with a Downfall placement?
29772,Nabooru was referred to as a sage in the Japanese version.
29932,Inconsequential references. There are references to things from every timeline. 
30181,Rutela from the Child Timeline's name is changed tho. All the places named after Rutela in BotW use the name Rut**a**la
30869,"Context of appearance matters. In the DT, the sole Sheikah represented, Impa, is serving the Royal Family and mentions her tribe. In the CT, Impaz is estranged from the Royal Family, living in the middle of nowhere, and mentions she's the last of her kind.

Also, in SS the Sheikah eye appears on Timeshift Stones in Lanayru, which is proof they are around. Regardless, we know the Sheikah are around because the event that is implied to almost wiped them out hasn't occurred yet."
32502,"Prior to Ocarina of Time, Sharp and Flat (Sheikah residents from Kakariko) composed the Sun Song for the Royal Family. That implies that the Sheikah are serving the Royal Family. But w/e. I'm done arguing with you. Like I said, context is important."
33948,Sooooo place it on Child Timeline because of one line (that could just be a meta reference) and disregard every other piece of lore in the game----Gotcha.
34288,The Divine Beasts were made after Ocarina of Time. Vah Ruta is explicitly said to get its name from the Sage Ruto.
34593,"&gt;As for where I think it's in the timeline, I still think it's the child timeline. Remember that the sages were the ones who executed Ganon in TP, and we only saw their spirits in that game in a flashback.

Those were the ancient sages from the Era of Chaos, not the Ocarina of Time sages.

&gt;There's signs of ancient technology in Twilight Princess as well. The Mask Midna wears has a guardian like vibe to it. 

Great. But the Twili's technology is pre-OoT because it originated and was utilized during the Interloper War.

&gt;More importantly, the mirror of Twilight is also in BotW as well

No, it's not."
34741,The Divine Beasts are explicitly stated to be named after the Ocarina of Time sages tho.
34842,"And the game directly says Ruto became a sage, something that doesn't happen in the Child Timeline."
35332,"From Ocarina of Time

&gt;""When evil rules all, an awakening
voice from the Sacred Realm will
call those destined to be Sages""


Ganondorf never rose to power in the Child Timeline. Therefore Ruto was never awakened as a sage.

"
35697,"Or it means that if these circumstances arise, these people were pre-destined to fulfill these roles."
36149,Who says their role has to be fulfilled even if it's not required in that era? It's way more likely that the Sages in TP are the Ancient Sages rather than the OoT sages. Ganondorf never broke into the Sacred Realm therefore he never had the chance to slay the old sages.
