21468,"&gt; - Arrows should be craftable (make rocks destructible for arrowheads, wood for the shafts, have birds drop feathers).

With the relatively unused flint, wood, and small birds (does anybody use those nuts, really?), I suspect they intended to make arrows craftable but didn't implement a crafting system outside of vendors before the game had to be finished. And once you're going to an arrow vendor anyways, why not just make you buy them with rupees?  "
