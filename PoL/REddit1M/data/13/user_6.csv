19667,"I have to watch it again but to me it makes sense. She thinks that there's a high chance that she will never see Link again, either he won't wake up or she won't last. As the Deku tree is watching over the biggest and most important item, one that directly ties to Link, it would make sense to leave him her (not so) biggest secret with the tree as well. He is mostly likely to live the longest of all the characters from 100 years ago. There's no other character really that I can see Zelda telling this to. 

I also need to watch that scene again since i'm at work and my memory sucks"
