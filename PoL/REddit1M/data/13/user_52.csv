41703,"I had a blast with this game! The experience overall was nothing short of fantastic and refreshing, but I did have some major problems with it. While the divine beasts were a very nice concept, I would have much more preferred proper dungeons. As much as I loved the whole world, I felt like it would have been much better to have it be smaller than it really is, as that way nintendo could have surely done the world design way better if it was more focused. The whole opening with the great plateau was fantastic, with the awakening, meeting the old man, the rising of the towers, the general introduction of the mechanics, and the ruined temple of time, the game surely raised my expectations. Unfortunately, while still fantastic overall, nowhere in the game have I gotten more enjoyment than the great plateau. While the whole survival aspect of the game (Weapon durability, cooking, no world drops of things like hearts) was incredibly interesting at first, I feel that a Zelda game is much better with  hearts, rupees, etc being world drops. I think this because that way, the designers have agency over the difficulty by choosing where the items go. After about the first ten hours or so of the game, I almost never ran out of food, and I barely ever died in this game. It may seem like I have a negative opinion on this game from these points, but it's actually far from it. While I feel the world could have been smaller, most of it still had a lot of time and effort put in that absolutely showed. The divine beasts, while disappointing, were still very intriguing, and the backstory and characters that went along with them were also interesting. Overall, I really enjoyed this game, and while it certainly falters in some areas for me, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts in this case, and I give it a solid 9/10.

TL;DR: While there were certainly a couple of problems, mainly the lack of a more gripping story akin to the opening of the game, uncovering its secrets and exploring the world certainly pays off. 9/10."
