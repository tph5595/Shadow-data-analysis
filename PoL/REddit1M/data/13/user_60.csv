52713,"Just beat the main quest. 

Really underwhelmed, Ganon was super easy if you have all 4 of the powers the campion gave you. And his second form wasn't even a threat, after that, Zelda just comes up and calls you a hero. The end. The credits don't even tell you thank you for playing. 

I still have a lot more content to do (find 3 more memories, more shrines, etc.) and maybe I'll face him again with the Champion's powers disabled, but that ending... literally made me sad because it left a lot to be desired. 

I really hope we get a MM like sequel, with different ambitions. It's clear that the fun in BoTW comes from playing it and not actually beating it, but games with good, satisfying endings are what gives you the biggest impact. "
