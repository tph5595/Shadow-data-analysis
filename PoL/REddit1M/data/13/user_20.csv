8648,"Can someone explain to me the significance of the ""silent princess"" please? On the box art there was one growing from/right by the master sword and Zelda mentioned they were growing again. I just thought they were gonna have a greater significance. 

Also- Link was in hibernation mode for 100 years, so I  understand why he's the same age, but why is Zelda the same age? She's just been locked up in Hyrule castle. "
