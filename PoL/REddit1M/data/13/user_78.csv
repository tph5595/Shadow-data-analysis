79121,Yeah everyone's complaining about how easy this game is but its the first Zelda I've ever died in. Ever. And I've died a *lot*.

They all have a crystal looking rock on their back that is vulnerable to bombs, bomb arrows, and two handed weapons. The Talus themselves are also climbable. Just shoot the crystal, the. get on top of them once he's down and charge attack once or twice and they're gone. The elemental ones are the hardest but even then it's mostly cuz the crystal thing is in a less convenient spot."
