Cute ending nonetheless. Happy about this game, if light on the plot. Not sure if I wanna continue on this save by getting all the shrines and stuff or if I wanna start over and play the thing again now though!"
6146,"I did get them all! I really loved every second of it, I just expected more emotions I think? Like Midnas reveal at the end of TP, or the King's wish at the end of Wind Waker. Or maybe I just didn't experience it in the same way :P "

And that's the thing, right, he doesn't remember his vigorous training and his struggles, so he's not this blank, emotionless person anymore. So, uh, why not smile at Zelda after getting her back after that fight? Give her a hug, bro. 

The story was very mature, just a bit lacking in respects. I adored the premise of a struggling Zelda and a struggling Link, I just wish there was more. More of the Champions and their relatives. Link's father was mentioned, and I would have loved to see them interact. Showing more of the characters after the ending would be nice too. Just screencaps during the credits, like, Zelda seeing Impa again and stuff like that. That would be great, aiding the characters and their development. During Twilight Princess you get to see all the characters and their happiness and god I would have loved that out of BotW too. The true ending was pretty fuckin cute no lie, just... Quiet. It fell flat.

It's hard to not be well prepared for Ganon. You can step off the plateau, sneak through the castle, pick up all the items and then charge for the Calamity and you'll be fine. Ganon's boss fight, if you don't do the Devine Beast quests, is lengthy, but not hard.

The second phase is so cool though. The music was incredible, the use of the incredible horse AI made me so happy. But it wasn't of any danger. I didn't get hit once. Increase the difficulty and the threat and that would have been the most epic final boss of the entire series. Yet, for me, it has to take a back seat, considerably behind my number 1, Twilight Princess.

I'd like to think they're still finding their footing with this new format yet they hit it so well. I restarted on a different account, and I'm going to take my time and use the Pro UI this time. Plot was good, just a bit empty, gameplay was amazing and the boss could be a bit harder. "
