61673,"Any explanation for why Zelda isn't over 100 years old? Link staying the same age I can buy. I did read the diary in the Hateno Tech Lab about the anti aging thing so maybe that had something to do with it? Or am I missing something really obvious? I honestly was bracing myself for the moment Link meets 100 year old Zelda, which would have been extremely interesting and emotional, since at no point do you see Zelda in the game outside of flashbacks."
