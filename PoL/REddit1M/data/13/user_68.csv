Exploring the castle looking for loot and a way up, finding bits of lore like the King's journal and Zelda's journals, all while sneaking past guardians and taking out the smaller but still tough enemies was the pinnacle of the game. It really felt like everything you've done to that point was just to get ready for that dungeon. The openness of the Castle and the atmosphere really made it a great experience, it made me wish we had similar dungeons for each of the for Divine Beasts and maybe even for the three Springs."

I think having weapon smiths, or even just one, would have been good. You could even make it into another collectible type deal where if you bring a weapon to the smith, it would be added to the list of weapons they can make for you."
