59417,"BOTW is so unlike past Zelda games - for one, the story was sacrificed completely in order to craft an expansive game world that was truly ""open"". I can see why you'd be disappointed if you felt they prioritized the wrong things.

Personally, I'm starting to think open world games and truly good stories are mutually exclusive...

It might not be what you wanted, but I feel like giving credit where credit's due - the open world implementation is a triumph:

- The sense of freedom is unprecedented

- They've absolutely packed it with points of interest (so the 'empty' comment seems a little ridiculous, at least compared to other open world games, past Zeldas, and even games like Banjo Kazooie)

- I actually don't think I've seen a more stylistically beautiful game (photorealism is overrated, while we're on the topic of video game trends).

So while Nintendo is guilty of following a trend, at least they absolutely nailed it."
