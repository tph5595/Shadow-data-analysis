5503,"Yep. The bosses were pitifully easy, and not at all memorable. The 2nd part is what really gets me, tbh. Most of the time I knew I would be overpowered, being a completionist. The mechanics being boring and simple were what really soured the bosses for me. I felt more accomplished killing Lynels than I ever did beating a boss. 

Edit: I think this game also suffers a bit from the utter freedom you have. Being able to go anywhere and do anything at any time and in any order and the game being balanced as such really makes it easy to become stronger than the content. It's the same in any open world game."
7215,Same. I'll have to stick to challenge runs and learning the speedrun for now to get my difficulty jollies for this game. Nothing wrong with that either!
9735,"Haha for sure! Definitely seems like fun! I'm planning to look into the All Dungeons category, but any% is definitely on my radar. I also pity the runners going for 100%. ZFG has said that they already agreed Koroks will for sure be part of that category. May Hylia have mercy on those runners."
