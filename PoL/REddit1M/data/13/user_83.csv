87653,"This game is a masterpiece. My only issues were some of the plot things and bosses. The bosses were incredibly easy (except Thunderblight Ganon) and I think there were too many ways to defeat them which made them easy. I get that it's kind of the spirit of the game, but I would have liked for there to be a bit more difficulty. I felt like a lot of things were unresolved in the plot  and a lot of characters feel like they weren't as fleshed out as they could be. Granted, I haven't gotten all the memories yet and there's still a story DLC coming later and both of those things. Also, I fell the decision to have some voice acting but to still keep Link a silent protagonist was pointless and led to some scenes feeling weird. Another thing I didn't get was how Zelda was clearly going to ask the Great Deku Tree to tell Link that she loves him but then didn't end up actually telling him herself. Still, this game is easily already in my top 10 games of all time and I hope BotW 2 can fix these issues and top BotW."
