8053,"Yeah, I'm surprised I managed to beat him.  But I kind of cheesed it by using Urbosa's Fury for the majority of the damage.  I also had to fight what I assumed was the boss of the guardian for death mountain prior to Ganon.  

His second form was really easy and didn't really require anything special other than being familiar with using a bow and riding a horse.  

I didn't think I could beat him. Deciding to check out the castle finally turned into trying to climb to the top, which turned into checking out what was at the bottom of the hole in the floor of the steeple.  Which turned into checking out what the roots connected to downstairs.  Which turned into trying to poke the ball.  

""No way I can beat him but I'll see how far I'll get before deciding to check out Death Mountain."""
8475,"I just beat it a few hours ago.  It started by just wanting to check out the castle for the first time.  I wanted to avoid it since the game made it seem like instant death.  I bypassed pretty much everything by climbing and using Revali's Gale.  I think I ripped myself off so I'll probably just load a pre-castle exploration save and try checking out Death Mountain and doing side quests.  

Judging by the stuff I passed, I guess it was just a route up with enemies?  

I didn't even think I could reach Ganon without going through some mega-dungeon.  "
