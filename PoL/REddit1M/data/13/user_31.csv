16430,If you can handle a guardian or two you are ready. I beat Ganon without much of a fuss. Healing maybe 2 or 3 times and it was really bad damage on my part. If you're up to the challenge the game provides. Granted I beat the game with about 100 shrines and fully upgraded ancient armor with a ton of Guardian weapons. Needless to say it was laughably easy.
16628,If you're talking mechanically it's used to upgrade a certain piece of gear.
16870,How do you check? I couldn't figure it out. Also is there a place to check my playtime?
17067,Yup do your last dungeon and fight Ganon. No need to get any stronger if you don't want to. Seriously Ganon is a cake walk. I thought of Gwyn from dark souls while I was fighting him. If you can parry his laser beams he's a joke of a boss. 
18287,Well I have it on Wii u so I'll check that out later. I'm still curious though how are people checking their completion percentage or are they just making it up?
