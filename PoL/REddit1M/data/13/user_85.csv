95268,"&gt;The 4 beast dungeons were really fast, I beat 2 of them in under a half hour. 

Lol. It took me nearly a full hour just to work out how to make progress in my first sacred beast. It was Naboris and I just could work out how to do anything. I kept checking the map wondering what I could possibly be missing. The game did make a point of telling me to get it. Eventually I tried to rotate parts of it, but I was looking away from them when they were spinning. It made me feel like such an idiot once I actually did see the parts moving. 


After that the others were a breeze. "
