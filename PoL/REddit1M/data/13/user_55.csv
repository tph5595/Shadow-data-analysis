46530,I'm dicking around on the Great Plateu on a new save heading for the Cryosis shrine when a camp of Bokoblins spotted me. I tossed a bomb at them to clear them quickly. As I dodged a barrel one tossed at me I noticed another had picked up my bomb and was about to throw it back at me before I detonated it. This game is still throwing surprises (and bombs) at me!
