I must have glossed over that. Also why do I hear about that a minute after typing [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/5z5k9p/botw_something_about_link_and_zoras/devrin5/?utm_content=permalink&amp;utm_medium=user&amp;utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_name=frontpage) ?"
19260,Honestly this scene have bugged me a bit. I mean I think it's a bit strange in-universe to charge the Deku Tree of all people to deliver such a message in such circumstances right ? But on the other end it's what makes most sense even if it does not make 100% sense.

I acknowledge that it was only easy for me because I was really well prepared ^^^also ^^^I'm ^^^a ^^^good ^^^player ^^^^^right ^^^^^guys ^^^^^?

Phase 2 was lame but was so quick that you didn't have time to realize it was lame so it works I guess. I was kinda bummed about no one on one sword duel tho :("

Also as to why Zelda didn't age, the same point was actually [brought up yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/5yssk8/daily_all_spoilers_megathread_discuss_the_entire/det3mhk/). But the TL;DR is that the game doesn't explain it so you got two explanationâ€‹s : In-universe : Magic ! Out-universe : probably a conscious choice by the designers."

20283,You bet I wanna know now :D
20339,I guess when you put it that way it makes sense. I was thinking she would have said it to Impa but I didn't consider the possibility she could die of old age.

Thank you ! And yeah I've seen the journal already but thanks for the tip."
