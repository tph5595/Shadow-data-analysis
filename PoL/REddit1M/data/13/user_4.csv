2043,You need about 5 of the sapphire/ruby/topaz for either an upgrade or building a piece of gear but you don't need to do that either. The biggest money making stones in my experience are the luminous stones. 70 per is really good.
2370,"Just finished the game last night. I really liked the design of the last boss but I came in a bit too prepared. I had level 3 Hylian armor, 15 guardian arrows, 84 shrines, and a smattering of good weapons, including the master sword. Wish he had been a bit harder in phase 1 and phase 2 feels like it doesn't work. The only damage I took was from getting stepped on once. He didn't really do anything in phase 2. Really bummed there wasn't a human form fight.

Overall a really solid game deserving of much of it's praise and a lot of the criticisms I've seen going around the sub. I'm interested in what hard mode will offer (will it be a Master Quest or just Hero mode?) and the story DLC later in the year. For now I'm gonna take a short break from the game. 50 hours in a little over a week is a lot of time. The game hooked me from start to finish but I have responsibilities to catch up on now!"
