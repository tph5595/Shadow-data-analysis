Myself, I thought the final boss was lackluster. If you are well-prepared for Ganon, you could easily defeat both his phases in less than 8 minutes. I would honestly say that BotW's final boss is the weakest of any of the 3D Zelda titles.

I thought the overall story of the game was OK. Nothing amazing, but it wasn't particularly bad. The lack of a sidekick (Midna, Fi, Navi, etc.) and the lack of an arch enemy with a personality (Ganondorf, Zant, Girahim, Skull Kid, and Majora) gave me ZERO emotional investment in Link's adventure.

Link has no character development whatsoever. Every cutscene, and every character interaction, he is a blank slate that offers no input to any situation. (I'm aware that Zelda's diary dives into Link's silence and the meaning behind it, but tbh that is not satisfying) 

The most enjoyable parts of the story, for me, was searching for Link's memories. However, once collected, there is no true reward. You now just have the knowledge that Zelda was a science-geek that had doubts about her destiny, leading to her failure in saving Hyrule. There is no payoff in these character archs. We don't see Zelda deal with the trauma of losing everyone she knows and cares about. We never see the ""new"" gaurdians (Like the Zora Prince) provide any support outside their respected areas in the game.

I have so many quarrels with the story but at its core, Breath of the Wild is probably one of the best video games I've ever played. Hours upon hours of enjoyment and wonderment. A sloppily put together boss fight and ending can be overlooked, as my overall expierence with the game cannot be altered.

I would rate the game a solid 9/10.

I just wish there was ""more"". More divine beasts, with more bosses. More Ganon phases. I mean Twilight Princess had 4, that each evolve in terms of gameplay.

""Lackluster"" is how i felt. Lacking were temples and boss fights, lacking was difficulty during the 3rd act of the game.
