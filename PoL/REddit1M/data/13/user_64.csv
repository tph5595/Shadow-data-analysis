55960,I'm curious to see how others found their way through the lost woods? I personally got to the part with the torch and instead of using the torch at all I just went left from the torches til I saw trees with open mouths and followed them they brought me straight to the korok forest. It was only after I found my way through that I thought to follol the embers lol
