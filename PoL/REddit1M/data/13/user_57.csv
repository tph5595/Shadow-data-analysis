I had all my guardian abilities charged and ready and it made the final fight easy. I thought they'd challenge me more... Other than that, loved 200% everything else about the game. Just sad I beat the main story so quickly. Lol. Probably put 40ish hours into the game."
47274,This is the one thing that makes me most sad about the game. There is soooooo much to do and discover in this giant ass world. But how much of it is actually surrounded by Zelda and the core team of characters in this story? Very little. I loved the side quests and all the shrine challenges but after hearing how big this game was I was hoping it would have more story. It was very basic in the story department too. Though well told!
