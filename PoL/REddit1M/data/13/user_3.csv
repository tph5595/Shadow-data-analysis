1619,Once you have a lot of warp points gems are particularly easy to farm. I made my rupees by selling gems. Late game it won't matter too much but I hated the feeling of being broke early game.

11029,"Disagreed - Hold all monster parts until you get the dark link outfit. Trust me, you want the dark link outfit. "
12496,"There are none, you are correct. "
13603,There's actually I think like 5 or 6 or so.

Sorry about shit quality I just took and uploaded that with my phone from the book. "
17083,"I'm fairly positive there is no way to check playtime on the switch, only the wii u. "
18829,"There is scheduled DLC. I understand what you're saying but I have to disagree on the length. Maybe it's because I've played ocarina nearly annually for 10 or so years but the game is short if you want to play it to the point and the bosses are easy. The dungeons are lengthier and some of them (looking at you water temple) are more difficult. That being said a lot of those puzzles that extended the length of ocarina dungeons were placed into shrines in this game. My first play through of every Zelda game is the same - play it however I feel like it. Then on subsequent play throughs I'll go for 100 percent or 3 heart mode or what have you. I can say firmly that my first playthrough of this Zelda was by far the lengthiest of any other first play of any other Zelda. But this game gives you the canvas, you choose what to paint. If you want to paint a mostly straight line to the boss then the canvas will reflect that. "
21380,Kilton. He's a vendor you meet from a side quest and then after that he will show up outside of cities at night time. Once you beat the 4 divine beats he will have the dark link outfit in stock. He also has a few other doodads and gallywhoos as well. 
24667,I agree with most of this. But.... I got all armor sets to level 2 thinking the set bonus was the peak of the bonus they give..... You telling me level 4 climbing lets me climb even better? 
28183,"Isn't it more or less standard for Zelda games to have a more challenging second boss than end boss? Specifically looking at Ocarina - Ganon could be killed with your hammer so easily it was laughable. Ganondorf actually took some degree of timing, positioning, etc. Ganon was just epic. That's how I felt about this one. 

Although yes, personally, I would have loved more difficulty for all of the bosses particularly the last one. "
36105,"Trust me, I'd love some meteors and a more challenge main attack mechanic. I guess I'm just saying I'm not surprised. 

Interested to see what hard mode brings. Also I'm wondering how this game will look in hindsight post DLC. "
44457,I mean yeah... You're asking the subjective question of what you'd rather do - get the dark link outfit or not... I really wanted it so i got it. And yeah you can say whatever about getting level 4 gear but you don't need level 4 gear anyways. I beat the game in level 1 and beat the silver lynel in level 2... So... Level 4 gear is arguably just as 'useless' depending who you're talking to.
