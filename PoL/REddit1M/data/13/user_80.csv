81502,"I finished the game in 54 hours. 45 shrines, ~100 korogus, all memories and the Master Sword and the 4 dungeons done. 

Even if the designs of Ganon (Calamity and Beast) was great, I am a little disappointed, it was too easy and too short. For the beast phase, why Ganon stay still in the middle of the plain? :("

But still, the beast fight was too simple, why he doesn't move? :( 

Apart from that it was a fun battle"
