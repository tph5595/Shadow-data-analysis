3822,Yeah I'm interested in the hard mode too. I hope for paid DLC it does more than just make enemies deal more damage.

It was a smart way to really make every part of the game have something interesting."
4294,Did you get all the memories? I really liked the ending hearing the original Zelda title screen music done with an orchestra gave me chills. I just wish we really knew what Zelda wanted to tell Link when she spoke to the Deku tree.
4656,"Beat the game yesterday. I hadn't actually been into Hyrule castle until that point. It was an interesting idea of exploring all of the castle. However I think the game needed an actual dungeon once you got to the sanctum. I liked the final boss but he wasn't hard with the level 4 champion tunic hylian shield and master sword. I really liked the ending. It was cool hearing that original Zelda title screen music again, that music really typifies these games in a lot of ways. I liked the story a lot, you did feel bad for Zelda. 

I'm going through now to complete all the shrines I've done 80 so far. I love all the little challenges to unlock the shrines. Yesterday I was stalking a deer just so I could ride it to a pedestal to unlock a shrine. Tons of fun."
7755,Yeah the early game is hard enough as is the only place I'd want that would be towards the end game.
43947,"Okay lets look at it this way would you rather grind to get 10,000 rupees or sell off a bunch of your monster parts and minerals to get an easy 10,000 rupees or have a purely aesthetic but useless costume. I mean seriously all you really need is to get that ancient armor up to level 4. Switch out to other armors when you need to really climb or swim, but that's it. I know I *never* did any grinding at that point where I reached the 4th fairy fountain I had enough loot to just sell and made 10,000 easily with plenty left over. "
44122,"&gt; I didn't even think I could reach Ganon without going through some mega-dungeon.

I thought the same thing. I hope the DLC actually adds some full on dugeon type scenarios. Hell I'll say this I *really* want a Majoras Mask type sequel just using the same graphics and engine, but make it have dungeons like the old game but being able to climb all over the place. "
