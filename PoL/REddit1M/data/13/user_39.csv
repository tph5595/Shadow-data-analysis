Is not even that hard to make the fight more difficult. Just make so meteors constantly fall of the sky (Just like with Fire Wizzrobes) so that you have to watch out where you go during the shooting.

That would be enough to make me satisfied, but it would be even better if all weather conditions were active at the same time. Meteors, Ice AND Thunder, it would be perfectly fitting for someone that represents calamity."
