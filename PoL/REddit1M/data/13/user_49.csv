32851,"Yep. I was hoping the bosses (both for the Divine beasts and Ganon) would be very difficult considering there are only 4 dungeons in the game. They all had the same attack patterns, basically. I was hoping they'd look and act more like their respective divine beasts they took over, too, instead of these mindless entities. "
32929,"Yeah, I was going to 100% this game, but when I learned there were 900 Korok seeds...I just said fuck it. That's just artificial difficulty and busy work, IMO. "
33101,"At the same time, I feel like they should have scaled the bosses in difficulty as you got stronger. Like how they scaled overworld enemies, except for every Divine Beast you killed...the next ones would get stronger.

(If they DID do that, then clearly it wasn't enough to have any real impact)"
33454,"I found the final battle with Ganon &amp; the ending cutscenes to be underwhelming too.

Personally, I'm not going to bother with getting the rest of the shrines &amp; Korok seeds as there's no point. I'm going to give the game a break (a couple of months, maybe), then come back to it with a new challenge: No fast travelling &amp; only use one horse for the entire game (if original horse dies, I can get another one, but I can't kill it through friendly fire). 
That should be fun. I suspect I killed a bit of the immersion by fast travelling everywhere, and could be why I beat the game in under 30 hours despite exploring everywhere. "

34182,"My personal theory is that, at some point, all the timelines converged into one again and we are on a new timeline with combined elements from the other timelines (like the Koroks, Rito, mention of the Hero of Twilight, etc)"
34264,"That would have been an easy way to increase the difficulty level (and having different elemental meteors would have been perfect - harder to cheese the last fight with the different specialized armors to prevent burns, freezes, and shocking)"
34515,"Not sure why you were downvoted. You have a LOT of valid points that I agree with. BotW is a good game, but definitely isn't my favourite Zelda by a long shot, and they kind of dropped the ball on the story (seriously, they made a futuristic Zelda plot boring!), the difficulty (game was too easy overall), and the lack of enemy variety (leading to an overworld feeling very empty)"
92594,"What I say 'Too easy', I meant the bosses are too easy. The puzzles and divine beasts are too easy and/or too short. 

Of course, the overworld is difficult. I've died a lot in the overworld, mostly on lynels, but I've never died during any of the boss battles (including Ganon). They should have scaled the bosses as you got stronger. "
