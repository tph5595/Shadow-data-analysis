36712,"Pretty much all your story questions were answered in-game by Impa, her sister, the King, or through flashbacks.

&gt; How did Link first get the Master Sword?

He was chosen from Zelda's knights, because Calamity Ganon's first defeat 10,000 years earlier required it and they were basically trying to just recreate his first defeat piece-for-piece.

&gt; What exactly did Ganon do to hijack the guardians?

He used magic. He had fought them 10,000 years earlier, so he knew what was coming and was prepared.

&gt; How were the Champions chosen?

Not sure if this one was actually answered in-game, but I assume they were just the best people for the job. Revali sure as heck made a big deal about his qualifications.

&gt; What exactly prompted the search for lost technology?

A prophecy said that Hyrule would need the wisdom of their ancestors buried in the ground, so they started digging and happened to find the tech.

&gt; How did it become lost in the first place?

That tends to happen with 10,000 year old technology until you dig it up.

&gt; Where did it come from?

Where did the tech with Sheikah markings all over it come from? The tech that modern Sheikah learned how to operate and reverse engineer? I assume ancient Sheikah."

Well in a series that heavily involves *wizards*, that can happen. Sorry Peter Jackson didn't show in deep scientific detail how Gandalf's want can generate light without fire or electricity. If you're upset about Sheikah tech now, were you also flustered about how their OoT tech allowed bouncy rocks to spread gossip or magnifying lenses to see invisible objects? And speaking of magic, prophecies are taken a lot more seriously in a world where they are actually real, and the Royal Family of Hyrule specifically has always had deep ties to magic and prophecy.

I get that you want to know more lore, and I agree because lore is awesome, but that has nothing to do with storytelling because that's not what this story's about. Star Wars doesn't need to show us how hyperdrives were invented or how they work, we just need to know Han uses them to travel between systems (not that I'm saying BotW's story was amazing)."
