16827,"I was kind of disappointed with the dungeons/bosses overall. I found myself comparing this to OoT. The 4 beast dungeons were really fast, I beat 2 of them in under a half hour. And all of the bosses were pretty  similar. I was hoping there would be a whole 2nd half of the game after I fought Ganon, similar to what happens after you get the 3 spiritual stones. But nope, game over. Yeah there's an awesome world to explore, and plenty of side quests, but c'mon. I beat the game in a week of playing casually which is the fastest of any Zelda game I've played. I'm wondering if they left room for DLC?"
