NINTENDO PLEASE I WILL PAY GOOD MONEY FOR THE DOG PETTING DLC"

I think all dungeons will be the sweet spot, WR is already sub three hours. I watched it this morning, and even though three hours is amazing, he made some pretty big mistakes. I could see it getting down to 2:30 in no time at all. Mind, I'm merely a watcher of speedruns, not a runner."
