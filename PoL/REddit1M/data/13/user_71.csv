63737,"My take on it is that when she unlocked her powers (or at least from the moment she decided to fully use them to face Ganon) she temporarily ascended into some kind of immortal spirit form, or incarnation of Hylia. Notice how she can hear Fi talking (Fi being a creation of Hylia herself) after unlocking her power in the final memory.

I also noticed how she doesn't actually seem to have a physical body in the present until after she comes out once you've defeated dark beast Ganon.

Also, in the true ending, she talks about how she can no longer hear the voice in the sword. Presumably, having served her purpose, she's lost her goddess-like power and will continue aging normally from now on."
64120,"Yeah I thought you had to follow a path of trees with wicked looking grins to make it through, that's how I did it first time... although watching my brother do it later, I also noticed this didn't seem to be 100% reliable."
64744,"There's more ending after the credits roll, also there's an additional extra bit of ending if you unlock all the memories before beating Ganon.

Whether or not you'll think it's satisfying enough even with the additional ending remains to be seen, but I do think it helps. If the game literally ended with what happened before the credits, that would've been a bit weird."
65478,"&gt;the difficulty (game was too easy overall)

I can understand some of the other criticisms, but did I... did I just read that? I mean, we're talking about a series that has had several iterations now where huge seemingly deadly boss enemies hit you for as low as 1/4 of a heart in damage and never really posed any threat to begin with. This game is such a brutal and drastic departure from that, I think this has to be the first time I've heard anyone say that about it."
67120,"I have to say I feel similarly. It's easy to say ""the game only has 4 main dungeons"" it that doesn't sound like a whole lot, but when I sit back and look at it objectively, I can't exactly call the game short - I mean I'm pretty sure by the time I reached the final boss I'd put 75+ hours into the game (which surprised me actually, I didn't think it would be that much til my playtime came through yesterday). I don't think it's taken me more than ~35 hours of playtime to reach the end of the story of any other Zelda game before, even when I felt like I spent considerable time just messing around. And yep Ocarina is a super short game unless you get stuck not knowing what to do for hours at a time, multiple times.

I have to admit there's a part of me that hoped as I was approaching the final boss that Nintendo was about to send me the dark world or some other crazy twist like that. But I suppose if they did, there'd be people complaining that the game is too long. It's hard to find a balance in situations like this :\"

My take on this is that when she unlocked her powers (or at least from the moment she decided to fully use them to face Ganon) she temporarily ascended into some kind of immortal spirit form, or incarnation of Hylia. Notice how she can hear Fi talking (Fi being a creation of Hylia herself) after unlocking her power in the final memory.

I also noticed that she doesn't actually seem to have a physical body in the present until after she comes out once you've defeated dark beast Ganon, and even then she looks otherworldy as she seals him away.

Also, in the true ending, she talks about how she can no longer hear the voice in the sword. Presumably, having served her purpose, she's lost her goddess-like power and will continue aging normally from now on."
118594,"I guess I can sort of agree with that, but it really depends what we're comparing it to. If we're comparing it to other games in the series, the bosses in this game are far deadlier than anything in Twilight Princess, for example. A lot of past games had bosses that were aesthetically interesting and looked cool to fight but boiled down to a very basic strategy and never really posed much of a threat, especially if you brought a fairy or two.

I thought the way the divine beasts worked was pretty interesting, but any puzzle gameplay that I was missing in there is more than made up for in shrines - some of the puzzles I've seen in shrines are so far above and beyond just about *anything* I've seen in a past Zelda dungeon that I can't bring myself to be unsatisfied with less puzzles in the dungeons."
