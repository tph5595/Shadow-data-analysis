43726,"I finished my [review](https://gaminghonour.com/2017/03/13/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/) of the game earlier. It's honestly an amazing experience and the sense of adventure is something I've never really experienced before. I do agree with some of the complaints in this thread when it comes to dungeon bosses and Ganon. I can't decide if they're just too easy or if I came overly prepared (maybe a combination of the two?) but aside from that, it was one of the best games I've ever played."
