6056,"Almost certainly, especially since you can get pretty blatant confirmation that that's a true statement from an NPC after meeting a few requirements. I wish they didn't reveal that she wanted to say something only to not confirm whatever it was though, seemed a bit pointless.

19413,"You probably didn't, there are a few requirements to fulfill before getting this conversation. Though once you do get that conversation going they are extremely (and to a surprising degree imo) blatant about it. Up until that you could easily make a case for intentional ambiguity. If you want me to tell you how to get the conversation and which NPC it is and so forth I can tell you!"

It's Kass. If you complete all of the Shrine Quests he gives and the one regular Side Quest that involve his songs and talk to him at Rito Stable, then at Rito Village (also might need to complete the Warbler's Nest Shrine Quest) he will talk about his teacher and that he was a Shiekah who fell in love with Zelda but ""she only had eyes for her appointed knight"", and that her love for her knight is what awakened her powers and what convinced the guy to seek out the songs Kass gives you. He then gives one final song about you which you can ask him to replay any night at Rito Village. The song mentions her loving Link in the lyrics as well. It was weird how in your face he was about it compared to the rest of the game.

Finally, he also reveals he's well aware that you are the hero he keeps talking about.

P.S.: if you're not sure where to find Kass, at one of the locations he is in (south of Satori Mountain iirc) there's a journal where he documents all the places he wants to visit. "

No problem! "
