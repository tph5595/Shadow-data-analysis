1524,"What are the best things to sell to build up a reasonable bank of rupees? I sold the tattered shirt/pants because I figured I wouldn't need those again. Are there uses for amber or opals that I should hang on to those, or are those ok to profit off of?

1767,Same. I hate being broke even though I'm not far enough into the game to know whether I really need rupees or not. The only rupees I've spent so far was 20 to register my awesome blue horse. I started to sell a gem and then I was like wait maybe I need these for something important.
