&amp;nbsp;  
- One of the best games I've ever played. I love how I load up the game with an idea of what I'm going to do and not 2 minutes later the game is pulling my attention in a dozen directions. Masterclass in open-world design.  
&amp;nbsp;  
- Arrows should be craftable (make rocks destructible for arrowheads, wood for the shafts, have birds drop feathers).  
&amp;nbsp;  
- The master sword should constantly restore its power when not in use, not only after its been completely depleted (hitting it on rocks to fully deplete it feels kind of silly)  
&amp;nbsp;  
- I wish upgrading armor visually changed how the set looks (like the Witcher sets from TW3). Finding/upgrading armor was the most fun I had though. I love how the game necessitated using the right armor in the right situation.  
&amp;nbsp;  
- The fully upgraded climbing set completely changes the game IMO. I wish I had made it a priority earlier. Anyone looking to get all the shrines should get it ASAP.   
&amp;nbsp;  
- Voice acting was kind of meh, but all the champions were awesome from a personality standpoint. I loved finding the memories too. Especially the memory involving the Silent Princess flower.  
&amp;nbsp;  
- Longform dungeons would have been cool, but if I'm being honest 120 shrines was more than enough to satisfy my dungeon needs. If you treat the chests as mandatory they'll keep you busy plenty long. The game does so many other things well.   
&amp;nbsp;  
- The rubber helm &gt;  
&amp;nbsp;  
- Lack of overworld music sucks, but the music that's in the game is awesome.  
&amp;nbsp;  
- I actually love the cooking mechanic. I guess a cookbook would be nice, but I love how the system encourages you to experiment. I haven't looked up any recipes because I love finding new ones. I've spent hours cooking food I have no need for.  
&amp;nbsp;  
- As an obsessive completionist, I'd rather not of known there are 900 Koroks. I still want that 100%, but god damn.  
&amp;nbsp;  
- The lack of dog petting is concerning.

Each piece has the inherent speed boost aside from the set bonus, but I don't think it's affected by the upgrades. I mostly think it's worth it because it gets the armor rating to a respectable level that you can essentially wear it all the time unless it's cold/hot/lynel. Maybe it was hyperbole, but the set makes exploring way more enjoyable."
