28684,"I'm just gonna come right out and say it: BotW is one of my least favorite Zeldas. I think it's a passably okay game that wouldn't have done nearly as well as it did if it weren't propped up by the Zelda name stamped on the cover. It fails to deliver the classic Zelda experience, and also fails to stand out in an industry already chock-full of open-world games.

**Combat**: I enjoyed how challenging it was in the early game, as well as the weapon variety and how fast-paced it is. However, it just kind of tapers off after you start getting knight weapons and can tank more than two hits. The majority of the enemies you fight are lizalfos, bokoblins, and moblins, so once you have their attack patterns down, the hardest part is making sure you have enough weapons to whittle away the HP of their reskinned variants.

**Music**: It was implemented well, such as how it would pick up while riding a horse, but I found the soundtrack mostly forgettable. The only bits that stood out to me were the main theme, and the ones that remixed classic themes. Even then, I was only reminded of how much better Koji Kondo's work was.

**Story**: You have an enormous world with half a dozen different races, real and tangible magic, a lost civilization with advanced technology, an eldritch abomination trying to destroy the world, and giant animal robots. This setting is a gold mine of potential, but it's all wasted. The trailers tell you 80% of what happens, you find out another 10% at the end of the prologue, and the rest comes out as you find lost memories, but there are so many unanswered questions. How did Link first get the Master Sword? What exactly did Ganon do to hijack the guardians? How were the Champions chosen? What exactly prompted the search for lost technology? How did it become lost in the first place? Where did it come from?

Think about that. *They failed to find the interesting story in a post-apocalyptic setting with lost technology, a variety of factions, and a pending war.* The last time someone made an open world game in a setting like that, we got Fallout: New Vegas.

**Items**: The problem with handing you a full loadout at the beginning of the game is that there's no sense of progression. I feel small and vulnerable at the beginning of other Zelda games, and powerful at the endgame once I've amassed a small armory of equipment. Here, the Sheikah Slate is about as good as it gets as soon as you end the prologue. Yes, the weapons you use get better over time, but the transition from rusty to royal is ruined by the fact that everything is disposable, to the point where almost nothing will last you through an extended skirmish. This is just my two cents, but I think a better idea would have been to remove durability limits and impose much smaller carrying capacity. Like at the start you can only bring two ""slots"" of equipment- do you go with sword and shield so you can attack and defend, sword and bow to attack at any range while sacrificing shield defense, or a single greatsword to REALLY ruin your enemies' day? You gradually unlock more slots over the course of the story, until eventually you can carry everything and it feels like an actual accomplishment.

**Characters**: What happened to this series? We used to have gems like Sheik, Midna, Groose, and Tingle; now we get generic big friendly guy, generic arrogant guy, generic shy healer girl, and generic proud woman. Despite their importance, I wouldn't even remember their names if they weren't shouted at me every fifteen minutes. To be fair though, I did feel that spark of imagination from Kass the traveling bard.

**Open World**: In his review of [Banjo-Kazooie](https://youtu.be/-_ZZAX_zt7Y?t=1m30s), dunkey notes that the current trend in gaming is to make the maps huge and nice to look at, but ultimately empty in a way that hampers the flow of the game. BotW tripped into this pitfall HARD. The huge, gorgeous overworld was touted as one of the main features of the game, but looking at glorified background scenery makes for a boring game. Especially when other games have even nicer background scenery, plus all the other things that make games actually fun to play.

We've been told that this is the kind of game that Zelda 1 wanted to be thirty years ago. The problem here is that other developers started making games like that ten years ago, the bar has risen significantly since then, and BotW gutted everything that makes Zelda a unique series. If I had to summarize this game in one sentence, it would be *""Haven't I played this already?""*"
39970,"Those aren't answers, those are half-assed [hand waves](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/HandWave) and prime examples of ""telling, not showing."" In order:

Yes, we know Link is the best knight, but that explains absolutely nothing about the Master Sword. Was it still in the forest? Did the royal family have it? Did it accept him simply because of how he was their strongest fighter, or was there some sort of quest or trial involved? Why weren't we shown what has always been one of the defining moments of any Zelda game?

A wizard did it. That is literally the laziest excuse that exists for bad writing.

The game does specify that the selected Champions showed the most aptitude for piloting, but never once actually gives any specifics. As far as I can tell, the only thing that qualified them is being able to stand on top of the robots and belt out a generic one-liner.

There has to be some specific, tangible catalyst for such an enormous undertaking. A vague prophecy sure as hell wouldn't convince any rational, responsible leader to expend significant amounts of resources on what could very well be a wild goose chase.

That doesn't answer my question. This is powerful, advanced technology unlike anything that can be reproduced with modern tools. Things like that don't just fall between the couch cushions. What kind of society-shattering event would cause our modern world to lose something like the internet, relegate it to legend, and make most historians to forget it existed?

Okay, so ancient technowizards did it. More bad, uninspired writing."
40909,"I know exactly why I'm being downvoted- because I'm not kowtowing to Nintendo's latest ""groundbreaking innovation"" like a good little fanboy should. It appalls me to see all the praise being heaped onto this game, because it's exactly what happened to series like Assassin's Creed, Call of Duty, and Halo: they made a number of good, successful games, then they got lazy and eventually started releasing subpar ones that mostly relied on name recognition in order to make obscene amounts of money.

I don't want that to happen to Zelda. It's my favorite series ever. OoT was the game that got me into gaming. I fell in love with the variety of items, memorable music, dungeon crawling, extensive lore, boss fights, and standout characters. To see all those wonderful things scooped out of the franchise and replaced with generic open-world elements... it kills me a little inside."
42341,"I think you're missing my point, ""[a wizard did it](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AWizardDidIt)"" doesn't refer to actual wizards, it refers to lazy writing being used to cover gaping plot holes.

&gt;Can be used to Hand Wave away minor nitpicks and Contrived Coincidences that should really be covered by Willing Suspension of Disbelief; however, using it to excuse major Plot Holes that the creators really should've caught beforehand will make people rightly angry. "
48223,"I agree with this comparison. Big, open, and fun, but not what we're really looking for when we turn to that series."
62196,"I disagree.

Just Cause 2 &amp; 3 also give you a glider, huge map, stunning visuals, and no pesky story to bog down your exploration. Plus, you get a grappling hook and rocket launcher.

Every Elder Scrolls and Fallout game made in the last fifteen years stuffs every corner of the map with unique items, locales, and quests. BotW's cut-and-paste korok challenges and monster camps are a poor excuse for filler content. The shrines are okay, but they alone aren't compelling enough for me to visit every nook and cranny in search of them.

BotW does indeed look good. It looks very good. But it borrowed so much from Wind Waker and Miyazaki's movies that I feel like it's more of a mashup of their styles than anything original. Again, not bad, but I can't really commend them for capitalizing on something that's already been done. Skyward Sword's ""watercolor painting"" style was much more creative, imho."
