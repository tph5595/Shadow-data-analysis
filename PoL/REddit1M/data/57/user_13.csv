I'd like it if they disabled all non-story dialogue, other than initial explanations of how to use dungeon items."

Inside Samus's visor there's a small light that goes from green-&gt;yellow-&gt;red depending on the charge of your wiimote battery. It never interrupts gameplay, but it keeps you constantly appraised of the battery life.

Accomplishes the same thing as Fi's interruptions without breaking gameplay. It would've been pretty cool if the Master Sword had a jewel that did something similar in Skyward Sword."
