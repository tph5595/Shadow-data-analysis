Every single franchise in Nintendo's library has gotten more and more explain-y over the years with no signs of going back.

You'll recall that even OoT did this to a point: If it was the first time you saw an item, you had to scroll through text, and after that you were fine. Then TP took it a step further: It was the same as OoT, but it ""erased"" any memory of picking up an item every time you turned off the game, so there's was always at least one ""first"" with every play though unless you were marathoning it. As I understand it, SS ignores whether or not it's your first time and just dumps the text on you regardless.

Pokemon has gotten pretty bad with this too. I can bet anyone reading this, even if they have never played a Pokemon game, knows how they might go about catching a Pokemon. Doesn't matter! The game will explain to you how to do it with unskippable cut scenes (despite the first games never feeling the need to do that unless you happened to accidentally talk to the right NPC). Know what a Pokemon Center is? Doesn't matter, same deal there.

People have been wanting a ""I know what all this shit is, please don't go through explaining it"" option for at least a decade now, if not more. The *only* knock against OoT in otherwise praising reviews back in the day was that the cut scenes were unskippable a second time through-- that's 15 years Nintendo's had to implement ""faster"" gameplay beyond faster text scrolling, and they don't seem interested.

Not to be a downer, but I simply do not see Nintendo listening to these requests any time soon."

Only in FireRed and LeafGreen. In the actual Gen I games, he only gives you a tutorial if you talk to him. If you don't talk to him, you can just walk past."
