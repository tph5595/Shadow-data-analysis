I would say the ONLY puzzles that impressed me were the time shift stones. All the other puzzles were bland and were done better in previous incarnations of the series, and didn't have a robot explaining how to solve them."
67496,"The sword play wasn't accurate enough to make this feasible. There were often times when the enemy sword would just automatically switch to the way I was swinging, or the wiimote just plain wouldn't swing in the right direction. This wasn't a huge problem until the moblins with the electric swords where I was penalised for the WiiMote not registering my swing properly.
People are saying that a mechanic like this is fine if it's perfect and doesn't hinder the game experience, challenge shouldn't come from wrestling with the controls.
Imagine if you were a game programmer making a game like Zelda, but using buttons instead, and someone told you that the attack button works 95% of the time.
That would be completely unacceptable, but now it's okay because it's motion controlled?
Nintendo recognised that the wiimote swordplay wasn't perfect, which is why we get 6 hearts at the start of Skyward Sword instead of 3, it's to cover up the hits the player gets from the wii not recognising the players actions and getting a game over before they enter the first dungeon.

I think it's interesting that Nintendo championed the analog stick with the Nintendo 64 and now they seem to absolutely hate it, making EVERYTHING motion controlled, eg the loftwing, when using the analog stick would have been infinitely more satisfying and less frustrating.


Oh and Fi was bullshit. In the dungeons, whenever you get an item, Link would hold the item up to the sky and the text box would appear telling you how to use an item.
In any other Zelda game, you are then placed in a room and the only way out is a simple puzzle that teaches you how to use the item, which serves as the item tutorial and you can move on.
In SS, you get the item, the text box appears telling you how to use the item, and then fucking Fi pops out and explains how to use the item again. It's just pointlessly frustrating, because the rooms where you key items is something that the Zelda series has gotten universally right."
