16327,"I couldn't finish Skyward Sword due to the amount of hand-holding it had. I got pretty excited about it and picked it up for my WiiU but the game was just too damn annoying to enjoy for me. The dowsing, OP's text-box popping up every time you pickup a new item since booting up the game, Phi constantly interrupting stating that there's a 87% chance that the objective is this way. Just stop it, stop pulling me out of the experience with this hand-holding. People are upset at Phil Fish, but he was right that certain Japanese games treat you like an idiot, and Skyward Sword was not the exception for me. "
