23054,"Hmm; I'm the opposite - I thought Skyward Sword's controls felt really clunky in comparison to Twilight Princess.  I had to reorient the gyroscope every couple of minutes, pointing with it (rather than the higher-fidelity, readily available infrared LEDs), and constantly found myself having to be particularly careful about doing the motion perfectly in order to slash in the correct direction.

Twilight princess, on the other had, felt buttery-smooth.  No, you didn't get the same ""choose the direction of the slash"", but it meant that I never got frustrated because it wouldn't do the right motion due to the gyroscope being out-of-alignment."

The stylus added the ability to make many things much easier - object manipulation, targeting, selection... While the DS Zeldas only did an okay job using them (I still enjoyed Phantom Hourglass, though!), MP: Hunters was phenomenal.  The controls were intuitive and had a quick-and-shallow learning-curve."

This is exactly why I thought the experience felt unpolished.  I should never have to recalibrate a sensor so often.  Having to do this was up there (""down there""?) with Fi's hand-holding and the explanation of a rupee/relic/etc every time you picked one up on my list of ""biggest irritations"" with SS."
