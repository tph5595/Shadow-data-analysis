Not to say that I didn't enjoy it - spastically flailing my arms around while mowing down fools in TP was way more fun than the bullshit you had to do in SS (especially with how squirrelly the MotionPlus controls still were), but I do appreciate the thought put into the SS enemy design with regards to sword motions."

However, when it takes a something like minute to kill a single bokoblin (don't even get me started on technoblins) due to a slice going in a direction different from the one you made, it gets pretty frustrating."
