20261,"Really. Way less water level changing, the master quest version is much more of a room-by-room dungeon ""solve this puzzle, go to the next room and solve that puzzle, etc"", rather than the original which was more about figuring out where you had to go rather than what you had to do there.


The really hard temple on master quest is actually the fire temple."
