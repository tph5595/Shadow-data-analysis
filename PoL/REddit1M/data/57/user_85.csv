33254,"I definitely agree with this. It breaks the immersion and pacing of certain sequences in the game. I think they should explain what each item does only once. If you happen to forget what a particular item does, you can open your menu and read its description.


Also, to those of you hating on the motion controls, I can understand how you can get frustrated but once you take the time to learn how to make your strikes fluid then you'll quickly find that your movements are read very well. Often I would find my friends dismissing the game due to the controls but I would see that they would swing the Wiimote in the same way without changing their approaches very much. What I found to work best is to get more of your arm involved rather than flicking your wrist. Finding the right speed to swing is also pretty crucial but it's no problem with a little practice. Once I mastered these steps, I found myself quickly mowing through baddies.


The thing that I absolutely love about these controls is that it makes every enemy almost like a puzzle. Once you figure out each's pattern, the game becomes especially fun. The combat is a lot more dynamic because dodging and shield parrying are more important than any previous game. Once you utilize the shield bash, enemies become a cinch because they get stunned. I find this style of fighting way more fun than mashing a single button to combo my enemies to death, but that's just my opinion.


Also, I don't know if everyone knows this, but you can also jump attack by dashing and swinging you sword. This instantly knocks down an enemy which allows you to perform a finishing blow right away. Alternatively, when you stun an enemy with a shield parry, you can spin attack to knock them down to also perform a finishing blow.


One thing that I hope that they add to the next game is sheathing your sword with a cool spinny animation like they did in TP, which was done by pressing A right after killing an enemy/ group of enemies. I always thought that was a nice little touch.


Anyway, I hope one day everyone will give SS another shot as it truly was a really fun and satisfying game."
