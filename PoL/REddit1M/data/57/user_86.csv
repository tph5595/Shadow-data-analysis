33446,"If you want the new game to play like Skyward Sword's motion control do, it couldn't be optional.  They'd have to design the game around the motion controls, because that's what made Skyward Sword's use of them so good.

If it were an option, you wouldn't be able to design any fight strategy/puzzles/anything for it, and it'd just feel tacked on.

Nintendo has already said that they'll be using the Wii U gamepad, so if they do have an option for Wiimotes down the line, it'd have to control somewhat like Twilight Princess did on Wii."
121103,I think you missed the point.
121164,I'd much rather put Fi in a cage and have to be bothered by Gaebora a few times.. as opposed to constantly throughout the game.
121669,"I feel like you should probably give FF another chance, because generally, Zelda fans are also Final Fantasy fans.

FF7 (and many others) also have a wide open world to explore, which is much bigger than any ever seen in Zelda, by a long shot."
122058,It actually took closer to 10-15.. but yeah.
