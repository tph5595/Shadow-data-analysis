33209,Wallet limit has always been in the games. They actually made it easier on you with Link putting the rupees back into the chest (assuming you want to take the time to go back and get it).
33245,Skyward Sword was one of the easiest Zelda titles I've ever played.
33557,"What are you talking about? If they *didn't* put this in, it would *save* them time. It's 2 seconds every time you open a chest. I never read it, I just tap A until it lets me play the game again.

Why waste time to add something that only serves to annoy your players?"
33776,"Me neither. It was just too babying. None of the bosses had interesting designs or felt challenging (Koloktos was the only boss I enjoyed). After the second time fighting Ghirahim, I lost interest."
37971,"A feeling of progression. If you have bigger wallet sizes in the game, you can also make them available as quest rewards, which adds more content to the game."
41976,"All of them except for Adventure of Link, Hourglass, and Spirit Tracks. You barely have to figure out anything for yourself in SS. About half the damage I took was because the Wiimote controls weren't responding correctly. Not to mention that they recycle two bosses three times, and you don't really have to learn much to beat them again.

Not many Zelda games are difficult anyway, but SS definitely falls on the lower spectrum, for me."
49205,"Sure, the enemies took alternating attacks to kill, but it didn't really make it more difficult. The puzzles were okay when Fi didn't explain them to you after you entered the room."
64155,"Probably. I mean, rupees are pretty worthless most of the time. Limiting your wallet size doesn't usually do much. If you could have 99999 rupees from the get-go, I probably wouldn't care, but I also don't mind if they keep wallet upgrades in the game."
