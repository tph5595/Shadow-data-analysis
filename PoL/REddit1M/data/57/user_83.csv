32554,This is why I never finished Skyward Sword. 
32608,I don't understand how that passed QA. 
41236,Not really. Every time I turn it on the game just drags on because every item I pick up feels the need to declare it's existence. It's annoying and tedious. For me it ruins the whole experience. 
41459,"Other zelda games do not re-tell you every item description on pick up every time you turn the game on. 

I can go play my old Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, or Twilight Princess and pick it up and just pick up items. The game doesn't tell me what a rupee is, it won't tell me how to use a bomb or an arrow. It did that once, once was enough. "
42229,"It's not a small thing though, and it's not limited to that. 

It's poor design if the game's entire flow is disrupted in the name of constantly-re calibrating the motion controller. That's what the game ends up being: slow and clunky because of this. Even then, the calibration makes zero sense because it only does this ONCE per game load. If the pop-ups for items were needed to calibrate the wii-mote the it would happen constantly. You calibrate it initially when you turn the game on. 

You can't skip through the descriptions, you can't even speed up the text. You have to sit and wait. This happens even with the NPC interactions too. 

When I *did* play it, it was fun. It's a bad experience though to be shoved descriptions every time you load the game again. "
42571,I do not recall that happening in twilight princess at all. 
43016,"Oh get away with that apologist attitude. 

It's not isolated to the story elements. It's every interaction with any NPC at any point that stays on screen for far too long. It's absolutely ridiculous that I'm being told that I *should* be reading at a slower pace. 

If the game had voice acting (which I'm not arguing it should or shouldn't), then I'd give it some slack because the voice acting can dictate the flow. 

So yes. I should be able to skip dialog because I may have seen it before, I may be reading quickly, I may have accidentally spoken to the NPC, or I already know how many rupies the blue one gives because **it's been the same every game**."
49933,Not sure if you read that one properly.
