7453,I'm really hoping for options and difficulty settings for the next one. the are adding a higher difficulty for WWHD so.....fingers crossed.
8412,I've played through hero mode and it wasn't THAT much harder. I would like a difficulty setting from the start. I've been playing Zelda for years and since the WW I am able to breeze through these games. Playing through MM right now and it's been a while since a Zelda game has made me want to pull my hair out.
8449,"Yup.
