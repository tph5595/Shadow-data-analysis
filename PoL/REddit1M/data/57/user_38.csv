15808,"For the next Zelda Game:

- Make all cut scenes/dialog skippable if wanted (just like TP)
- Don't tell us about the same item 100 times (like the blue rupee)
- NO AWFUL MOTION CONTROLS (i know some people disagree but seriously, fuck motion controls)
- No stupid padding the game with ""you need to now run around and 
collect this thingy before you can move on!"" (Ex: Triforce Shards, TP Tears)
- Finally, STOP WITH THE HAND HOLDING"
23685,"i would agree that the game was more challenging, and thats because the motion controls SUCKED.  :D"
