7576,"Skyward Sword also had a hard mode after you beat the game, so it seems likely they'd do it again."
8772,I thought Skyward Sword was at least more difficult than Wind Waker and Twilight Princess.
38966,How many Zelda games have you played?...
44081,"Hardly. Perhaps you're forgetting how easily enemies were defeated in Twilight Princess or how many items you were given in Wind Waker. Skyward Sword actually took altering actions to defeat enemies, swinging from different directions and knowing when to shield, not just button mashing. And aside from that, I thought the puzzles in the game were done very well, particularly those involving the time shift stones. But in terms of where to go next after completing a task, Skyward Sword never left you on your own for that (or should I say, Fi). Either way, I thought it was more difficult than Wind Waker and Twilight Princess by a lot, and the the motion controls worked fine for me."
60123,"It wasn't just swinging in different directions, it was enemies signaling you to swing in a different direction or to shield, and timing it before they struck you. Very similar to the game Punch-Out. It actually made combat a game instead of simple button mashing. Most of the puzzles as well didn't involve Fi, Fi mostly stuck her nose in during non-dungeon segments, which I agree, was too hand-holdy. But the puzzles within the dungeons were well made, and tricky."
89978,I honestly did not share any of those those problems with the motion controls. It worked every time for me.
