41104,That's a stupid reason
41343,Has it stopped you from playing any other zelda game?
41797,"Every time you pick up a rupee over 5, it will tell you. It made sense with the motion detection to keep the instructions up because it gave the game a chance to calibrate with the wiimote. This one, very small thing should not have any impact on whether or not you finish an otherwise stellar game. "

Miyamoto has a story he's telling and damnit you're going to listen to it. Yes, it's a little annoying that you can't skip them after having already experienced them, but in the (my) overall checklist of good gaming (story/gameplay/fun/graphics) it doesn't really factor in. The story is  good. The gameplay is very fun (aside from the messages you seem to hate so much). The graphic style was cool. And it was, I repeat, FUN. It's not a game that is meant to be rushed through. Wanting to race through the game, skip dialogue, and not be hindered by explanations puts you in a minority of zelda players"
49326,Exactly. It's been the same every game. Why are you bitching about this one?
