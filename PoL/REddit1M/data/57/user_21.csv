I really hate how I find a treasure chest with 200 rupees in it and depending on the game either rupees go to waste or Link just puts it back in the treasure where I'll never remember to come back to it. Even when I go crazy buying stuff in shops I still somehow manage to quickly reach the wallet limit!"

21489,"I can't remember if it was TP or SS but in one of them if you find a rupee that doesn't fit in your wallet Link puts it back in the chest and in the other one, he just picks it up anyway, meaning that if you were one rupee below your wallet limit and picked up a 200 Rupee, you would just have thrown away 199 Rupees."
35190,"Yep, I know it's been in all the games and I see how they tried to make a solution out of the problem by putting rupees back in the chest. But wouldn't it be easier just to scrap the wallet limit altogether? What benefit is there to having it at all anyway? The shops that sell the better, more expensive items are either in inaccessible locations at the start of the game or they don't even stock the better items until later in the game anyway."
62412,I see and that can appreciate it but it just seems just purely superficial and aesthetic rather than a practical gameplay mechanic.
62817,"I reiterate, even if someone had the time and motivation to grind up to one million rupees at the start of the game, there would no point since the shops that sell the better and more expensive items are in inaccessible areas at that point of the game or the shops won't even stock them until later in the game. It would offer the player no advantage whatsoever and would be a complete waste of their time to grind that many rupees. "
