61052,"Personally, I think the best thing to do is to just not mention battery life at all. If the battery dies out, let the player be alerted by the message that says ""There is no Wii Controller connected"". Super Mario Galaxy 2 CONSTANTLY alerts you when have 1 bar left on your batteries, but in reality, 1 bar = additional 2 hours. At minimum. And sometimes the batteries ""die"" and I just pop them out and switch them and I get another fine 30 minutes without problem."
