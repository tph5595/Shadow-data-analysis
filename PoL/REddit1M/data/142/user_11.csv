43993,"Just to say, since I've seen a fair number of people have trouble at first recognizing this: There is a difference between heat and flammability. They're two different conditions and require different solutions, the same way that you might put on a tank top if you're hanging out at the beach but would wear a proper firefighting suit if you were going into a burning building.

Prices are really not that high (I think the helmet is the most expensive of the three, so you can buy the lesser expensive parts of the armor first). Selling Amber and Opals, because they're easy to replace, can get you some good money, as will the more common monster parts like Bokoblin/Moblin/Lizalfos Horns and Fangs. "

Sometimes, for some reason, a glitch I guess, he'll spawn before midnight, and sometimes he won't spawn at all (necessitating I warp back to the tower and glide back down to enter the region again and reset the game's calc's). But generally speaking, he loves a midnight stroll around the lake."
44908,There's also another bridge in the southern jungle of Hyrule that he likes flying around; I wonder if you'd have a better spawning result there if you continue having trouble at Lake Hylia.

The other two dragons can sometimes feel like they spawn in multiple locations, but it's that they have a specific path they travel and depending on where you are at the time they spawn, they'll spawn at a different point along that path."
