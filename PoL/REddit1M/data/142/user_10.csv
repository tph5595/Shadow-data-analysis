One feature I really liked is the hero's path mode, very useful for exploring and finding secrets. Places you've missed become easy to find on the map like this.  
Exploration is the best part of the game, so getting your path right from the start is nice.

Overall the dlc is a bit overpriced, but I would still recommend it."
