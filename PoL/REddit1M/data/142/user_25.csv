116582,Just got it for Christmas and I'm at Zoros Domain. My Weapons are amazing but my armour only allows me to take two hits. I got the Zoros chest piece and the champions shirt but they are not better then my current armour that I upgraded at the fairy pond. Is this normal or do I need to find new armour?
147850,Ok so now in going into Gerudo city with six hearts and Two new stamina bars. I still have the Zoro Armour + Leggings. I'm wondering if I should go to that Robbie guy to see if I can get better stuff? Thanks for the help. I'm trying to not watch videos because of spoilers just looking for some advice and maybe some tips
148350,Ya I'm basically just going form tower to tower right now and completing every shrine in between. Still just can't find new armour.
