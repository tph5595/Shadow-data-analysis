197873,"Is there anything more to do in the Great Plateau after you get the paraglider?  I went straight to all 4 temples and only found the warm doublet AFTER I finished the mountain stuff.  Felt like there should have been some path to follow to pull that off easier.  Just want to know if I should go back to this area at all.  I've been in Kakariko and Hetero Villages and some stables so not far at all yet.  Done 4 more shrines, and need to find more asap!"
