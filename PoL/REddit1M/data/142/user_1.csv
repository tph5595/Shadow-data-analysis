2464,I just want to say that I haven’t had as much fun exploring since I played Skyrim. I spent probably 30 minutes rounding up chickens the other day. Glad I bought this. 
45204,Yes. I did that one and I lit the torches. Cool little village
183954,Am I wasting my time lighting lanterns with the blue flame or does something happen if I light them all?
184494,Thanks. It’s like the lanterns in cap world all over again
235208,"Most enemies I’m coming up against take forever for me to kill, I’m constantly breaking my handheld weapons and I’m running out of arrows. Is this normal or am I traveling places I shouldn’t really be yet? "
269019,Thanks. I think I’m going to hang around the plateau for a while and try to gather some of those ancient materials and find some easier shrines. I went into a shrine yesterday and broke every melee weapon I had and the boss had 90% health left.
