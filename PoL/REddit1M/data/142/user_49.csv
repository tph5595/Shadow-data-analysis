306501,"I just got a switch and zelda for Christmas... I’m currently at my first divine beast which is Ruta &amp; I haven’t entered the dungeon yet out of fear I am too weak to beat the boss (I already did the shock arrow thing in the beginning.) How many hearts and what power lvl of weps/armor should I have before I start it? I currently have 5 hearts and like +3 stamina boosts so I completed around 21 shrines so far. help?? update: i completed the dungeon and did all the terminals now I just gotta do the boss fight, wish me luck. ik im gonna die like twice before I figure it out :(  YALL I actually killed him on the first try with tons of bomb and ice arrows and meleed him at the end!!
