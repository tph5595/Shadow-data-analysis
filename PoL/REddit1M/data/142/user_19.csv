59551,"I need a hint. I have 119 shrines currently, and I know my last one is in the Central Hyrule region. I don't want to straight up look up where it is, but I think I can justify in my mind getting a vague pointer towards where it is.

The seven I have so far are:

Noya Neha, near Castle Town Prison

Katah Chuki, near the Quarry Ruins

Kaam Ya'tak, near Mount Daphnes

Rotah Ooh, by the Outskirt Stable

Dah Kaso, near the Gerudo Canyon Pass

Wahgo Katta, by the Riverside Stable

And Namika Ozz, on Crenel Hills.

I swear I've roamed every square inch of this region, and I'm pretty sure I don't have any shrine quests left, so I'm  baffled here. Please *do not* tell me the exact location, but a hint or something would really be appreciated."
