361244,"I’m at the end of the game and I’m trying to find all the remaining shrines. I have two left. One is from the blood moon shrine quest. The other I have no idea.  I’ve used a map and determined that I have all 119 shrines on the map exception being the blood moon.  So that means I found a shrine but did not complete it. Any way knowing how on a map? 

Edit:  on my loading screen it says 118 shrines.  Does that mean I’m missing one or could I not have completed one?

Edit:  I found it. The shrine icon was yellow instead of blue on my map.  Lol"
