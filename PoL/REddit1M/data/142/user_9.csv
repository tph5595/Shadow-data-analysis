22823,"Have you visited the monument that gives you the three map locations?

Are you at the Flight Range?

Are the targets glowing with Sheikah emblems?"
23609,"&gt; Yes to all 3.

And what happens when you shoot a target?"
24298,Can you think of a way to break 4 before any of them come back?
24515,Lol glad you got it mate
56535,"&gt;I just finished the first divine beast

Which one? The game is open world, you could've done any of them first.

&gt; I'm wondering if I'll ever be pointed into the direction of the master sword?

When you get the map for the region it's in you'll immediately know its location if you're familiar with other Zelda games. Even if you don't, the location looks interesting and you'll want to investigate it anyway. *And* a certain helpful NPC outright gives you directions to its location, but doesn't tell you the sword is there.

&gt;Am I supposed to seek for it or will it be prompted too me?

A handful of NPCs mention that a legendary sword is out there in the world but you never need to get it.

&gt;Am I even closed to getting it?

You could've gotten to it as soon as you left the Great Plateau if you wandered in the right direction. Or you could beat the game without ever seeing it. We can't know how close you are without knowing where on the map you've explored"
57236,"That'll just ruin it, but sure: [north, center](/spoiler)"
62255,"It's one of the handful of shrines that is both undetectable by the shrine sensor and also doesn't have a shrine quest. It might be tough to find.

Not very specific: [north](/spoiler)

Specific: [in Hyrule Castle](/spoiler)

Exact location: [the Docks](/spoiler)"
74201,You didn't try selecting the markers on the map and pressing A?
126241,"&gt;My 5-speed horse with the ancient saddle/bridle periodically brays and refuses to sprint, even though our bond is at max.

This can happen if there's a predicted obstacle in the path, and there's also a weird little window of time right as one spur is ending where the horse will refuse start another one. If you want you could share a video capture of it happening, might help figure out the issue

&gt;Soothing him after this causes the ""sparkle"" effect indicating our bond has increased.

You can do this with any maxed horse, it has no effect"
126287,"You don't even have to do all the *main* quests to beat the game. Just do what you feel like doing, but most people will recommend completing all the Main Quests."
126412,It would be much more beneficial for you to find another Great Fairy. You're naturally brought to a few of them by getting to towers and following main quests
139753,No problem mate
145179,"&gt;So why don’t all the monks hiding in the shrines get out of there to fight Ganon

As far as we know, Maz Koshia is the only monk capable of getting up and fighting in the present.

&gt;one of them was a handful to deal with, was harder for me than Ganon

Gameplay-story segregation is a thing - he's probably not actually stronger than Ganon"
237038,Grante doesn't give you a hint for where to find the Hylian Shield. The only NPC I know of who does is Russ or the other shield-surfing fan on the hill near Woodland Stable.
250645,"The thunderhelm makes you immune to the damage and effects of lightning strikes, yes. I have a feeling you're taking damage from something else, perhaps grass burning at your feet that was caused by the thunder that struck you."
283659,No problem mate
323707,You're probably good. Keep in mind you can try out anything in this game and if it's too difficult you can quit and try again later
323759,"2/5/3 horses are objectively the best for anything besides mounted combat, so get one of those. You can do a quick google to find out where to get the best horses"
323865,You can't upgrade armor more than once until you find another fairy fountain. When you do you can see the needed materials.
323917,"Yes you can continue your save file after destroying Ganon, but no, you can't continue the story after the events of the final boss fight if that's what you mean."
460335,"No, there's no such nerf, but of course enemies are higher ranks in Master Mode so they have higher health.

&gt;since I have the Yiga clan coming up I’m a bit concerned

The Blademasters patrolling the area are scripted to die instantly from any sneakstrike."
460535,"In general with BotW you can always quit something partway through and it'll still be there for you to do whenever you want later.

&gt;I already defeated the Yiga clan hideout

Then you're going to get Yiga ambushes. Remember Kohga's last words? ""The Yiga Clan will track you to the ends of Hyruuuule!"""
460598,"You shouldn't *worry* about them, no. They're so abundant that you'll naturally come across far more than you'll ever need if you explore"
463085,No problem mate
471536,"I imagine the mods would be fine with that, I don't think they outright delete BotW question threads. What's this possible bug?"
498312,"That's likely your controller de-syncing, a known hardware defect rather than a bug with the game"
500985,"Definitely google Nintendo support, that's what you need"
543906,"No, the expansion only adds one more container/vessel, leaving two slots empty"
564363,"There are many ruins surrounding the ruined Hyrule Castle you saw at the beginning of the game. That's a very generic phrase, whoever said it may not have been talking about any specific area."
599084,"It covers a huge area, deals alright damage to all enemies in its radius, and most importantly stuns them for a very long time. If you avoid using the last hit of your melee combos you won't knock enemies out of their stun, too, so you can just casually combo an entire enemy camp to death with melee after one Fury.

It also does massive damage on bosses specifically. If you want to get rid of a boss real quick, burning all three Furies helps with that"
