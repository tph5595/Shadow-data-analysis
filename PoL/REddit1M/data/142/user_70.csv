481148,"I played about 60 hours of BOTW on Wii U this summer but we just upgraded to a Switch and I am going to play through again. 

Last time I did the beasts in this order: Zora, Gerudo, Rito, Goron. 

I'd like to do them in a different order this time around, even though it feels like Zora is the natural starting place. Do any of you experts have suggestions/arguments for the best order, whether that's for story reasons or for game-play/unlock reasons? "
