124346,"My 5-speed horse with the ancient saddle/bridle periodically brays and refuses to sprint, even though our bond is at max. Soothing him after this causes the ""sparkle"" effect indicating our bond has increased. Why could this be happening?"
136753,"&gt; there's also a weird little window of time right as one spur is ending where the horse will refuse start another one.

I suspect this is the case. I didn't realize that was a thing, as I can use another spur before the window. Thanks!"
