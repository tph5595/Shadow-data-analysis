440738,So I started doing the Gerudo beast first and I just read by accident that the damn Yiga clan will harass me if I finish it. Can I just switch to another beast? I'm at the point where I need to get a sand seal to go inside the beast so I already defeated the Yiga clan hideout. The Gerudo chief is waiting for me.
450171,Sounds good! Thanks!
460966,Ah that makes sense cause I just got ambushed on my way to Zora. Thanks!
