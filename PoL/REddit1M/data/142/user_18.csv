55546,Got the game for Christmas and haven't been able to put it down. I don't want anything spoiled for me but I just finished the first divine beast and I'm wondering if I'll ever be pointed into the direction of the master sword? Am I supposed to seek for it or will it be prompted too me? Am I even closed to getting it? 
56876,Just do this for me. If I open the map. Where should I go if want this sword right now? Is it on the left side? Right side? Towards the middle?
