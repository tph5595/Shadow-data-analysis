Selling. Sell amber ore and monster parts if you have a good stash."

Talk to people. Pick up stuff. Climb up high. You'll get a feel.

The camera comes along the way of the main quest. No need to rush it."

Cook food to restore your hearts. Find shrines and trade spirit orbs in for hearts. 

Your armor will improve, and you will get stronger. No need to rush that (or fight a certain creature in the Zora area who kills you with one hit)."

If for whatever reason you don't want to do that, going to the colored spot automatically cancels it."

If you follow the quest linearly, you miss a lot."
