44318,"I agree with Shalie for the most part. I bought the DLC after I'd finished the game and honestly think that's the way to go. The main reason is that if you plan to replay the game from scratch, it'll add some features and weapons that will really enhance your replays.

A reason not to get it before you finish the game is that there is at least one item that if you use it, it will make the game far too easy. Won't spoil it, but I think you really should run thru the game as originally designed for the first play.

I've never bought any lootboxes or other DLC so I don't know how the Zelda one compares, but I got far more out of this $20 than any two movies I've ever seen. But maybe when you figure the DLC cost compared to the original Zelda price it's kinda high. You get maybe 10% more content for 1/3rd the original price. But it was well worth it for me. . ."

For what it's worth, I've been playing it since May and only just now finding nothing more to do. . ."

Also, understand that once you beat Ganon, all the incentive you have to upgrade your weapons and armor to the max is now gone.

2) Definitely get the Hylian shield before Ganon, it's far superior for parrying beam attacks. The general area where you find it is one of my favorite locations in the game so don't miss exploring that.

For me, I didn't particularly enjoy taking out Ganon, or any of the Beast boss battles. My goal after doing all 4 Beasts was to have max weapons, armor and ancient arrows to get thru Ganon which took a while. Also, I found on my first replay with that DLC feature that shows where you've been, that there were a lot of areas I never explored the first time. So my take is, enjoy exploring - it's the best part of the game."

The one's you'll run into are not nearly as intimidating as the one's in their hideout. They won't harass you if you're on horseback, and frankly, they're good bow and arrow training. 

You might look north-east for your next beast challenge. . ."

Maybe “breaks” is too harsh, but the mask lets you sneak by bokos and moblins without them attacking you. Comes in handy for raiding weapons, but food buffs will do the same. Since learning combat is a vital part of the game the mask will put you behind a bit.

If you think you’ll replay the game, the DLC will make the game a lot more interesting after you’ve beat it without it. . .

Have fun!"
