70386,Is there a way to unmark spots? I can't spot anything new because I've used all 5 or 6 color spots (binocular view).
71702,I don't mean the map markers. It's about the binocular view and the 5 or 6 pillars.
72506,Hmkay. I'll try it later. Couldn't find the option.
77635,I've tried to unselected the markings in the binocular view. :|
