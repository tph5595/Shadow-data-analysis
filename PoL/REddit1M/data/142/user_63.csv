But if you must know, on the Great Plateau, inside the old man's house, there was a small side quest you could do and he'd give you the jacket. You could also get the jacket by going into the cold area and finding the old man... somewhere. If you found him, he'd reward you with the jacket."

447150,The game is absolutely huge. You'll get lost for hours. Good luck!

But you'll need at least level 2 burn resistance to survive in some places in the area... so you'll need to buy another piece or stock up big time on elixirs. I recommend just buying another piece. You can sell almost anything in your inventory (minus weapons). If you are selling raw ingredients, think about cooking them first - your cooking sells for more than the raw ingredients. Hope this helps!"

And Link is the one true hero who is supposed to save Hyrule. Why would they go to fight Ganon (and we don't know if they actually could fight like Maz Koshia) when the one true hero is right there in front of them getting ready to take on his destiny and fight Ganon?"
