I got this for Christmas and I'm to the point where I have to find images from Zelda that are on my slate... and I've just been making spicy foods when I need to stay warm."

The world really feels like everything interacts logically with everything else, and even just traversing from one point to another can become a trial that requires some ingenuity and resourcefulness (when you haven't gotten all the fast travel spots to it open yet). It's a different from the other Zelda games, but I get my fix of the classic dungeoneering stuff in the bite sized shrines, which for me occur about as often as I'd want them to."
