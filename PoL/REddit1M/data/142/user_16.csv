There’s not much of importance on the plateau that you haven’t already gotten (some treasure chests and… *other collectibles*, both of which there are many, many hundreds of in the rest of the world. And you now have six warp points on the Plateau you can use to get back there at any time.

If playing the heck out of the tutorial is how you *want* to play BotW, then great! But don’t do it out of *fear*, because nothing in the game is permanently missable, and the only places that ever lock you out when you finish them are the Divine Beasts."
129078,"&gt;	Should I wait until I finish the main quest until I start exploring the world? I don't have the camera yet.

The main quest will take you to all four corners of the world, pretty much literally. Also, fully finishing the main quest only happens when you beat Ganon, and after the finale cutscene you’re returned to before you beat him.

So the answer is, do whatever you feel like at the moment. Follow your every whim! Explore randomly when you want, head straight for quest markers when you don’t. It’s your world!

…*Except*, I really would go to Hateno immediately after Kakariko. The features accompanying the camera are very helpful to your exploration throughout the game."

Otherwise, many/most side quests have monetary rewards. There are minigames that pay, as well."

Also, it might not work if you haven’t activated any map towers other than the Plateau’s."
385696,"What do you mean by “worry about”? They are currency for buying inventory expansions from a character you first meet on the road to Kakariko.  They are everywhere throughout the world, and you only need half of them (441 out of 900) to max out your inventory. It’s feasible to find that many without the Korok Mask at all.

So I don’t know exactly what you’re asking, but hopefully this info helps"
386037,"Bonneton’s are way more infuriating. The ones in Zelda have at least one purpose (checkpoints en route to tech lab), which makes it far less frustrating that there’s no bonus for getting them all"
