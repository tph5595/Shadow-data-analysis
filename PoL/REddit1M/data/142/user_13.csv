47799,"Okay just got my Switch, and BotW today. I have played all day long, I hate to admit how long it took me to get the little jacket that lets me walk in the cold mountains.

I haven't had this much fun in a game... I wanna say ever. The devs on this game care, and it shows.

Just got my glider. I didn't think getting out of the first area would take all day!

Anyway my question where do I find horses? I haven't left the plateau yet if that's the issue."

57612,"Haha, I did head out now, the next area is way bigger then the plateau. This game is gonna take me a while lol"

If you want more detail let me know. Didn't wanna totally ruin it for you if you don't want the info."
109735,"In the Great Plateau, teleport to the Owa Daim Shrine. Looking over the cliff adjacent to the shrine (northeast-east) is a small shack.

Inside that shack is a journal, it tells of a lost forgotten recipe that the old man living there has forgotten how to make.

If you bring him this recipe as he is sitting by the fire outside his shack he will grant you the Warm Doublet. A jacket that will negate cold temperatures (worth noting that it does not protect against severe cold temperatures)

You will need to find: Raw Meat, Hyrule Bass and Spicy Peppers. That's is the long lost recipe the old man forgot.

I had to follow him around a bit until he sat by his cooking fire before the dialogue to share the recipe with him would open up.

Hope that helps! Good luck!"
