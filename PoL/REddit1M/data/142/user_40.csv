I got for it Christmas and it's sucking the life of if me. I love it !
I'm done with 22 shrines.
Got about 12 korok seeds in total,maybe. 
Now I really want to 100% it. 
But I really need an estimate. I love this game."

I'm a sucker for environments. 
So yea considering how much I've completed it's going to take me 5 times the amount of time it took you. Haha. Thanks anyways ! Appreciate it."

Don't feel like it. I'm just going to do whatever korok stuff is right in front of me when I explore."
