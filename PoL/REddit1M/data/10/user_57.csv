43696,"this game is a 5/5 for me and its one of my top zeldas for sure. BUT i just have to complain about the ending. Not that it was bad, i actually liked it. However it just felt a bit like a weaker ending to me than the other zelda titles. It didnt feel so rewarding killing Ganon compared to the other games. there was no epic final kill except for shooting the arrow into his head, which wasnt nearly as cool to me as the wind waker/ twilight princess/ skyward sword executions. And even after, the way the game was wrapped up didnt feel as good as it did when you beat  the other titles.    Another small thing was i just wish the 4 champions were involved in the game a bit more. I really like all of their characters and it seems like theyre just easily forgotten (given that theyre dead i guess i cant complain too much about them being a larger focus of the game). "
