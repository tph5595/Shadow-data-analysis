23470,"I felt like the difficulty level was a little weird in this game. The game is totally willing to have field enemies poke you for most of your life, break all of your weapons and your soul with a major test of strength, throw you in close proximity with a Lynel before one divine beast, and have lightning destroy you even through 2x elec resist leading up to another divine beast (lol escort quest on slippery sand seals).

That's cool and all, but then you board a divine beast and find like 4 half-broken guardian scouts that die before they can even attack and a handful of eyes to shoot. I kind of get that they can't make the story stuff *too* difficult, but that doesn't really hold up when everything you have to do leading up to the divine beasts is so much more threatening."

Realizing I was underpowered while fighting the first snow lizalfos, I ran past a ton more enemies (accidentally overwriting my last cold res with a stealth effect), and found a huge cancer dragon to face off against with barely any arrows while dying from the cold. It took a couple reloads, all of my elemental arrows, most of my food+ingredients, and a fairy at the very end when I fell too far after my last bullet-time, but I got it done! I love how you can just wander around the world on a whim and still feel like you're making progress](/spoiler)"
