31058,"Through to be honest, the explanation makes a lot less sense for memories 9 to 17 given how Link and Zelda are comfortable around each other (Zelda even quotes Link in memory 14 IIRC) but I appreciate that they justified Link being silent for basically every other part of the game, and I understand why they did it that way in the memories (voice acting would anger the fanbase, text in a voice acted cutscene would be odd, and mid cutscene choices wouldn't work since it's a memory)"
31184,It's after you complete her Divine Beast if you want to google it.
31302,Yeah the blessing shrines are usually the best. The only ones that were a bit weak were the Korok ones IMO but they're better than most puzzle shrines.
31435,"You have to complete all main quests to get the true ending. Unless that's not what you're asking ? I don't know what you mean by ""fill my memories"", the true ending isn't a memory, it's the opposite, you have to get all memories (among other things) to get it."
31646,"Uh ? I tried that and it didn't work. I guess I wasn't looking correctly.

In the end I bruteforced it like I always do in OOT (though it's a lot harder to brute force than in OOT where you never void out, it's harder to avoid voiding out here.)"
31847,"I think the real reason is they simply didn't wanted an old Zelda which I can understand. It can easily be explained away with ""magic"" tho."
33630,"Well what you said is pretty much all main quests. There's just find the fairy fountain on top of that, and I don't know if it is required. But I guess it is."
36263,"""Come on Link... Let's head to Zora's domain... But first, let's go to Goron's village... I need some medecine for my back too..."""
36343,"Yeah that's what I did, but as I said it's harder than in OOT where you could go close to the loading zone and if it stayed black instead of having the next one fading in, you knew it was the wrong one. The range was forgiving too."
