41592,"Zelda wasn't really fleshed out. Also it was basically the same as OoT. I enjoyed the Tetra aspect of Wind Waker but they really didn't touch on it anymore then they did was Shiek in OoT.

WW Zelda = Helped us a bit as Tetra, became Zelda and stayed locked away in a room the rest of the game

OoT Zelda = Stayed in a room as Zelda, Shiek helped us out a bit.

Breath of the Wild easily has the most fleshed out and powerful Zelda in the series imo. It's actually quite wonderful."
