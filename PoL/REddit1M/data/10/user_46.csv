I loved the voice acting (although there were certain points that felt rushed and not how a real person would speak), I loved the open world, I loved how much Zelda was fleshed out. I missed seeing Ganondorf, though the final fight with Ganon, in my opinion, was EPIC. I just loved everything about this game. Getting all of the memories was amazing... I loved the cutscenes. The humor yet how downplayed everything is is just amazing to me. "
