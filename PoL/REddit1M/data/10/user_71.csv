57527,"Finished the game tonight, and my first con is quite literally the last part of the game.  No continuation after you save Princess Zelda?  That is extremely lame.  I wanted to see reactions of all the townspeople, continue cleaning up the mess, etc.

Though I am only 20.67% through the game, so I guess I can keep going and go back for a ""final"" kill."
