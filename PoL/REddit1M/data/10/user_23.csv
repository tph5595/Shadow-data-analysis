And if you really want to be a completionist, you have to complete the Hyrule Compendium, which I don't know how some people will if they missed taking a picture of the 4 dungeon bosses."
15124,"I do think a lot of the main quest isn't as developed as it should be, especially pre-dungeon. Between finding Rito Village and getting into the dungeon is probably the most ridiculously easy thing to do. The quest to shoot 3 arrows in the air was laughable, and that was the only mission before you go to the dungeon? Seriously shorter than a lot of side quests. And then the mini-game before the dungeon is definitely the easiest of the 4. Then you have the very end of the game, the climax of the whole thing, and you're playing a mini-game that looks like its designed for a 5 year old. "
