14364,"That's something that really bothers me. I get that they are supposed to be tough, but that fact that the final boss, one of the most evil and world threatening characters in any video game, is laughable compared to a lynel who (I feel like) isn't even a mini-boss."
17443,"The one thing I absolutely didn't like was how they treated the Triforce (and the trinity as a whole: Link, Zelda, and Ganon). With the exception of a few games, the Triforce is one of (if not) the main reason(s) for conflict in Hyrule. There was no mention of it at all in the game, and no mention how it's chosen wielders are eternally locked to always reincarnate or resurrect.

Something I'm not happy with but can look past is how Ganon is portrayed, instead of being a villian with motives like before, he's seen as a calamity (no pun intended) that just likes destruction. It's ""ok"" because as Zelda said herself, ""He's given up reincarnation and shown his pure enraged form"" (or something like that). What I got from it (and I like this idea) is that there is no more Ganon/dorf, it's purely Demise all over again with a different name/look.

Two things I love are:

* Open world: I love to kickback, relax, and do random things while exploring for no reason at all.

* Voice acting: I feel like I'm the only one that likes this. Almost all of the voices were spot on to the character's race/personality. Impa's I did not like however as she sounded like she was talking to a bunch of 3 year olds (yea I get she's over 100 years old, but her voice did not sit well for me).

Overall, this is one of my favorite Zelda games. I haven't had some of these feelings (sad for seeing characters no longer alive, wanting revenge on the enemies, etc.) since I played Xenoblade Chronicles. I'm hoping the DLC will continue the story or look back on what happened 10,000 years ago when the Divine Beasts and the Guardians were made."
