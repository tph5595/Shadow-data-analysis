Also I missed complicated puzzly temples as usual in Zeldas. Shrines are a 1-2 nobrain rooms. Beasts are like way too simple too. Anyway, I have only completed 22% of the game. I wish I could check the korok seeds I have already so I can visit the rest using a guide. Same with shrines."

To my eyes is lazy and irresponsible."
202859,I would not look for answer where they are not. They explained the whole 100 years thing except for zelda. To me that's a storyline mistake. That's just my opinion.
