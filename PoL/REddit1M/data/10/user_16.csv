Climbing

Once I saw his beast form, I immediately tried climbing on him to get to some weakpoints, you only just get hurt. You don't do that at all. Combat part of the first phase was great. But it doesn't use your stamina gauge much at all. I guess you could just run at ganon without a mount though."

It's refreshing that you don't have any tips to fight the boss. but then you also don't know the best tools. I mean you'd use cryosis to stop ice block attacks and create platforms for waterblight, that's pretty clear. But then there's things like thunderblight where you have to use magnesis to zap the boss with the lightning rods. Fireblight is even more obscure. When it starts sucking in things. it begins to dislike smoke."
