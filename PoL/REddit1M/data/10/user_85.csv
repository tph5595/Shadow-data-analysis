Normally I wouldn't have expected it since other games in the series don't do it, but the dialogue telling me to come back and join the Gerudo guard and the Deku Tree telling me he wanted to see Zelda's smile made me hopeful that it would be there this time. I guess we can assume that those things happen off-screen during the rebuilding of Hyrule."
