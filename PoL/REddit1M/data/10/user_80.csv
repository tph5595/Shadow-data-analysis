65716,"Just finished last night as well. The ganon fight was somewhat underwhelming. Not sure if it was intended to be so or because I had completed so many of the shrines and open world bosses that he felt so underwhelming. Regardless it was still a feast for the eyes and still fun, just adding some cons to my gigantic list of pros for this game. 

as for story, the Zora section did feel like the most fleshed out, everything from the lead up to meeting the prince and even the city itself. I thought there was going to be more to the Mipha story as well, I guess after you unlock that divine beast, the little movie there was the closure. The Rito section was my least favorite. 

Hyrule castle didn't have any real build up or reasoning for that 3d map. No voice-over comments to help build some tension, just me running around owning guardians with the one-shot kill arrows. 

Again, I still think this game was amazing in all its simplicities and beauty. "
65769,"The picture thing is so tedious and annoying, not a fan of its interface either. "
65928,"Yes, no voice for Link was a good design choice. Lended itself to dialogue with characters addressing his silence and such. Also his voice to our own imagination is a lot better than when they made Link a toolbag in that cartoon from the 90s. "
66136,"I didn't even use the horse for the last phase, I accidentally jumped off and never bother to get back on. I ran around shooting weak points, a testament to that phase being underwhelming. I don't mind Zelda appearing, but that random bow just plopping down for you without any prior storytelling. "
66627,"The castle was so boring. you didn't miss much and the shield breaks, it doesn't regenerate anyways. 

inserting random complaint, having to watch the insufferable bloodmoon animation everytime it happens, skipping part of it doens't even help minimize the annoyance. Yeah yeah I get it, monsters popping up again, just show me once. "
114523,"from the same stupid platform in the same area, I lost count after 10, I'm pretty sure its above 12. ah well. I finally finished the Bloodmoon shrine quest, the one time i needed a bloodmoon, ugh. "
114857,"Yeah, exactly. After playing so many games let alone RPGs, it didn't occur to me that this world needed some explanation for the respawning of dead bokoblins. A little part of me was hoping that there was more to blood moons as compensation for all the eye rolling. 

I think I'll eventually wander to find the shield and put it on display as well. Right now I have stupid stuff on display, glow'y elemental weapons and boring shields like the korok forest ones"
