Some shrines are easy, some have been surprisingly difficult. There's been quite a few that took me a while to puzzle out.

You can see a Korok seed marker that can't be removed (and only appears when zoomed in) to check which Korok's you've already gotten. 

You can easily tell which shrines you've found and completed based on the map. If it's all blue you've completed it and gotten the orb, if it's blue with an orange centre you have activated it but not completed, and if it's all orange you've gotten close enough for it to appear on your map but it has not been activated (Misae Suma shrine in Gerudo Desert is the only time I've had this happen).
