57897,"So, how do the endings differ based on how many memories you find? I didn't think about being able to reload my save with 12, go find the last one, and do it again, so I just finished the game with all 13 done but couldn't figure out which part was the ""bonus"" part of the ending. Is it the scen after the, ""the end,"" screen about rebuilding Hyrule? Or something else?"
