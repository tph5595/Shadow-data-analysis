85723,"I believe his point is that fighting Ganon whenever you want is a big deal in the game, if you're good enough you can do it on starting gear, adding a starting requirement would ruin that aspect by players either needing stamina upgrades, or stamina restoration. Either way, a lot of players would get to the phase requiring stamina, realise they need stamina, and have to load a previous save, go cook stamina items and restart the fight from scratch. 

The current way is best, climbing would be good, but too restrictive for some players, even those without an issue but angry that they can fight Ganon on 3 hearts, but need upgrades to stamina. "

His son will challenge you to shoot all 20 targets in under 30 seconds, it's a lot more fun. I've only failed it once, and that's because my bow broke partway through and I didn't have a long range replacement. "
86383,"True, but they take advantage of it being an amiibo by using the hearts stored on it from TP, not to mention it looks awesome. 

It would be better if they had something similar in game, although I don't think Wolf Link specifically would be worth it without being an amiibo. "
86883,"I agree with you that it isn't that early in the timeline, but I disagree about it being a different branch. 

The Koroks are in BOTW, and the Great Deku Tree states in Wind Waker that they evolved to that form due to the sea covering everything. 

And in BOTW the description of salt mentions it being from ""The Ancient Sea"" if I recall correctly.


Please tell me if I'm wrong, but it definitely feels like it's post Wind Waker to me. "

Well, that lasted exactly as long as Dark Link in OOT.

Seriously though, if you like dark link a lot you can get the outfit. "
