42637,"I wonder how much that DLC storyline will encompass. With less than a year until it's supposed to come out, I don't expect it to be too big, but hopefully I'm pleasantly surprised. "
44045,Where is the completion percentage shown? 
44113,There are specific locations where you should be using the master sword. Out in the general overworld is not such a place. 
44305,"It's so ironic, being a Zelda game, but my biggest disappointment is the bosses. The dungeons, while short, bleed somewhat into the overworld. So while I would've liked them to be a bit bigger, they didn't disappoint. Getting into Ruta might have been my favorite part of the game. "
