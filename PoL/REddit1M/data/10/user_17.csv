9544,"So I just finished the game last night and I want to share some issues I feel the last phase of the game raised with me. Not to say this game isn't excellent, but I feel the climax of the game let the buildup down personally.

Fight with Calamity Ganon was great, loved how they incorporated aspects of the other blights. Beast Ganon was cool looking but dumb. Is he meant to attack or do anything? I just rode around in circles shooting weak points and suddenly the game was over. I'm fine with Ganon not being a character who talks, but there really needed to be a final more personally scaled phase to this fight. Like while Calamity Ganon is flying around and Zelda is building sacred power he sends a humanoid version out and you have to straight up duel him. Would feel like more payoff, especially since getting all the Divine Beasts takes his main fight phase health off by almost a full half.

The ending felt way too abrupt for me. Doing all the memories gives you such a great insight into BotW Zelda, who has an excellent story, but there's no payoff in rescuing her. Here's hoping the DLC story at year's end is post-Ganon and involves her. I want to see these two interact now rather than just the snippets we see.

I love the addition of voice acting, especially in the ally phases of taking on the Divine Beasts, but it really lampshades that Link is still silent. I get that there are only so many conventions they can break in one game, but it's not like the majority of us don't play Link straight as an upright hero, so giving him dialogue reflecting this wouldn't make the series unplayable and would allow for the next step of narrative development in these games. Zelda has always been a strong story IP of Nintendo's, and for how much life this game's story had it was stilted by Link just staring at everybody."

It's just so awkward when these emotional moments of reunion are Link just staring with the same facial expression. At least an indication that he is saying something would be nice, hell Teba and Revali both actively call out that he's just silent."
