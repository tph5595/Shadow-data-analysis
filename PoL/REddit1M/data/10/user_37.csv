Agree completely about the blood moon. The first time the blood moon happened I was completely in awe, it was the most terrifying experience I've had in a video game since maybe Under the Well in OoT. Then I thought... wait, the monsters I killed before come back alive? Like the ones back on the Plateau and stuff? 

Seems like a silly thing to even let me know about. I kinda figured things would reset after a certain amount of time, that's how video games tend to work. Now I roll my eyes and spam ""+"" every time. "
