And considering that it's not hard to get the master sword at around half-way through the game (it's tough, but not really that bad overall), that would turn one of this game's strong points - the combat - into a really repetitive slog. It would be fun for awhile, but the novelty of it would quickly give way to boredom. Making sure that other weapons still have merit keeps the game fresh for longer, and I feel like that's more important."
52306,That's a good point! Placing it later in the game could have solved that issue. I was personally happy with the route they took but I can see how you might find it frustrating.
