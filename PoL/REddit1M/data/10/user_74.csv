58575,"I wanted a third form to the Ganon fight. I even had an idea I feel is pretty good to go along with it.

I said it to a friend like this. Imagine if after Zelda sealed Ganon, the sphere that was him suddenly burst open, blowing her and Link back. She'd be back further as Link pulled out his Master Sword and dug it into the ground to keep from being pushed too far. When the burst stopped, it's revealed all of Link's equipment (except for what you were wearing and the Master Sword) was destroyed or blown off. Link would look up and see Ganon, only this time it was more human. It looked like Link, specifically Dark Link. Zelda would say something like ""He's taken on your form with the last of his energy!"" and explain that, in a desperate attempt to win, Ganon recognized that he couldn't beat Link in the forms he was in before. So he stripped down to a more collected form.

Cue final fight, which is a one on one sword fight. No shields. No bows. Just the Master Sword and your reflexes."
