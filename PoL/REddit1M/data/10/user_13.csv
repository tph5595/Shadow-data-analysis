8221,"I agree, Ganon had a lot of character in WW and even TP Ganon had more personality than Calamity. Evidently they chose to portray him as a force of nature this time, with the personality and motivation of a hurricane. I suppose it stands to reason that after enough cycles of defeat and reincarnation, Ganon would lose his patience, his sanity, and continue to mindlessly pursue the only thing that fate compels him to pursue."

21915,Zelda's diary in her room does mention (and explain) the fact that Link very rarely speaks. Did you see that?
22032,"I remember her saying that too, but it doesn't look like it's in any of the memories. Wish I could go through all the game's cutscenes."
26655,So is the Great Plateau just totally inaccessible from the ground?
51234,"Yeah but for some reason I was under the impression that, in a quest, Link would find or create a natural route from the ground to the plateau that you could walk or ride up. I thought I read that somewhere but I guess it was wrong."
