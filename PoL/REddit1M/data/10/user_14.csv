8357,"I agree. This is my very first Zelda game that I was committed to finishing and having Ganon as just a ""calamity"" was a letdown. I really expected to have a story behind him on how he ended up controlling the guardians and the divine beasts."
8534,The first time I stormed the castle I ran into some Lynels and they destroyed me. I thought the whole castle and the final boss will be just as difficult. Tonight I tried to find a route to avoid the Lynels. I just beat Ganon twice for the neutral and the true end. Beating him was very easy.  Turns out I'm just bad with Lynels. I still fucking hate them.
