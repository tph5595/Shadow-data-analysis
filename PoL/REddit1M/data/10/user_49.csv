32442,"I just beat it (slightly overprepared for the final fight, rather than not ready as I was worried I would be) and got a cutscene that genuinely made me think there would be a post-game with me &amp; Zelda fixing shit. I was pretty excited for a bit there! And then Continue at my save point immediately outside the castle with a star next to the save file... I really do hope that they add post-game in an update or DLC. "
32608,"The Divine Beasts were loosely themed - Vah Ruta had you using water to move things around, Vah Medoh was about air and flying, Vah Naboris was electricity focussed and Vah Redania did have you moving fire about. They weren't as distinctive as previous incarnations, but I immediately recognised Vah Ruta as a Water Temple, albeit not as obviously as other Zelda games."
33179,"I went through the entire interior of the castle (a few times, I'd raided it sneakily for weapons before) and then found out that, to actually get to the top, I'd have to actually take the exterior route all the way round? I tried it a bit. Went into the first jailhouse, had a drawn-out but not all that threatening fight with the Lynel, and then decided ""Screw it"", climbed to the top of the jailhouse and Revali's Gale all the way to the door.

You may be thinking of the Imprisoned, which was more like Demise-lite, but was the weakened and, well, imprisoned form rather than the fallback in the middle of a fight. The elemental essence of evil destruction chaos calamity and other synonyms are very much a Ganon thing, with that starting from Ocarina of Time. This is the same kind of transformation from OoT, and even more similar to the Twilight Princess fight, but taken to the next level. "

34484,"You can do as much or as little of the main quest as you want before you get any or every tower. I got most of the south-eastern towers before doing the first part of the main quest, and then had a similar kind of irritation to you and went about getting the rest of the towers. I would recommend getting some clothing that gives good cold resistance (north-western town sells some), but other than that you don't *need* anything else to get the towers. "
