But other than that do we know factually that all Hylians age like humans do? Do we know if having the blood of the goddess or being chosen by the goddess makes you age differently? The answer to these questions have no baring on the story at large. Point being that an agent of the light has been engaged with darkness incarnate for 100 years and destiny's hero is coming to save her. "
