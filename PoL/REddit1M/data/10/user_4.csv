2094,"go to the northern towers and look for a massive forest

no you dont lose your save, but you do lose all progress you made into the woods as is tradition

i did lost woods without a guide and its annoying but doable, you take a torch run in a direction a little bit if the mist starts coming hard do a uturn and try a new direction"
2214,"just finished it as well, could have killed ganon any point in the past 3 days but i was just exploring and doing stuff like getting dark link

of all the zelda games i think this one justified a ""post ganon"" continuation mode even if they generically gave every character oh wow you saved us tyvm lines and just let us carry on dicking about

i also feel like they didnt reach the storyline potential wise, i thought the zora domain had the best storyline and they just left it half done, no true mipha resolution and the other zora who liked him, i pray to god they add some zora quest DLC because it feels half finished"
4209,"they did say they'd add an original story as DLC so i guess we'll see if they make up for it with that at a reasonable price, I mean they've done 95% of the difficult work of building a great world to interact with, just add in some interesting storylines all I would suggest to push the game that little bit further"
34337,"obviously they cant cater to all levels of intellgience with the shrines but i thought it was very interesting how they've given you these tools to work with and theres usually 2 or 3 other ""cheese"" solutions in addition to the original solution

i thought the shrines were very well done and only 5 or so truely stumped me, theyre not supposed to be ""difficult"" its supposed to be assess the situation, think, haha i figured it out!"
34396,did you miss out on getting the hyrule shield then?
34535,"thats what i really liked about this game is that theres usually 2 or 3 solutions to doing something and they're all equally viable

"
34656,the final cut scene would be 100x better if zelda looked like impa and was like come on link lets go to zora domain and took 5 minutes to slowly waddle to her horse
78637,"in the grand scheme of things you'll only ever end up watching the blood moon animation like 5-10 times i thought it would have been nice if they had 3 or 4 cinematics to cycle through, doesn't even have to be anything good just not the fucking bokoblin fucks giggling at me every time"
