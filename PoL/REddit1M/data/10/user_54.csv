39399,"Am I the only one who's severely disappointed by the master sword in this game? It takes so much work to get, when you're honestly better off just using weapons that aren't a dead item slot for ten minuets after they break....

Like, I'd be ok with it if it did like, 80 damage and ran out of energy, thats a ton of damage for a 1 handed weapon in this game. That would be fair.

Personally I'd prefer that it do like, 60 damage and never break. Thats only a little more powerful than the strongest 1 hand (the savage lynel sword? does 58. correct me if thats not the best)

In it's current state, all I use it for is cutting down trees and breaking open ore rocks, and. thats not what the master sword was made for :/"
45851,"Well it's not called the Master-only-in-certain-places-sword is it? I don't think the game should have the right to tell me where I can and can't wield the Master Sword at it's full strength, period. No other zelda does that. I shouldn't have worked my butt off to get it and then receive a power *decrease* in 95% of the game's content! It isn't fair, fun, and nor does it make any sense relative to all of the master sword's other appearances."
46162,"what exactly are those circumstances? I know that procs in [hyrule castle](https://www.reddit.com/spoiler) but I'm not aware of how it works outside of that area, if at all."
52108,"Well, thats when you gate the master sword more. Make it 15 hearts instead of 13. or require you to do all the divine beasts before you can get it. Or heck! Make a quest where you have to repair it to bring it back to full strength! There are so many good ways nintendo could have gone about making the master sword balanced and still really good. But they did this instead, and now I'll never be able to look at it the same way again. "
