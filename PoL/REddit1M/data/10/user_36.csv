21196,"huh, is that how you got through?  I got through by avoiding the tree faces.  I noticed that as long as I wasn't in one's line of sight, I never got warped out, so I circled around everything slowly and got to the end torch-less"
21354,"Y'all are crazy, the Lynels have like 4 attack patterns plus a couple bow attacks if you go too far away.  they're intimidating, but pretty simple."
21569,"The best way I've seen Ganon described is that he's been destroyed over and over again, and while he revives one way or another, it still damaged his being.  By the time of BotW (well over 10,000 years after OoT), there's basically nothing left but the evil power regenerating him.  Idk if that makes you like it anymore, but I find it a cool concept and love the design of his first form - oozing evil cobbled together with corrupt guardian parts attempting to form a body."
30897,"I guess so?  I don't have experience with greatswords/axes if there are those, but the spear ones are very dodgeable.  If you don't trust your back/side step, you can always sprint at an angle from how they're coming.  shoot 'em in the face while they charge fireballs for a stun, and parrying jump attacks lets you get a couple hits in close range before they reset."
83492,"as sure as you may be, I'm afraid you're terribly wrong.  it's definitely not that early in any timeline, and very probably not in that branch at all."

It hasn't been concluded yet for sure (and probably won't be until official statement), but current evidence that I'm aware of makes Adult timeline the least likely (but by no means impossible) option.  There are Koroks, but they're spirits rather than normal creatures, so it's believed they don't so much ""evolve"" as ""become"" as in take on forms as suits them.  It's even possible that the humanoid Kokiri forms are the exception rather than the rule and only happened to raise OoT Link.  In WW, all the Zora became Rito (as far as we're aware - all games WW and onward have only monstrous Zora), but in BotW there's both.  So there shouldn't be intelligent Zora in that timeline unless they re-evolved, but if that could happen for the Zora, it could happen for the Rito in any timeline as well.  The presence of the Zora and the large differences in physiology lead me to strongly believe these are indeed different species of Rito.  (Note, I haven't been to them in game yet, so if there's concrete lore one way or the other, I apologize that I don't know it yet.)  The one thing that's easiest to explain as being the Adult timeline is the plaque referencing Ruto from OoT matching that timeline the best.  However, it is vague and could be construed multiple ways.

Now, to speak to the other timelines a bit:  The Child timeline (my current fore-runner) has evidence in Zelda's mention of Twilight in the ceremony memory (""Whether skyward bound, adrift in time, or steeped in the glowing embers of twilight""), one of Ganon's forms sharing a name with one from TP, and the mural added to TP HD as you can see [here](http://www.universozelda.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/MuralOrni.jpg).  For me, that's the real smoking gun.  It strikes me as setting precedent for a race of Rito in that timeline.  Evidence for the Defeat timeline comes in having the closest geographical and structural matches to features in BotW and that it best fits the portrayal of Ganon as a monstrous and recurring threat because he's only known to have attacked once each in the other timeline.  But of course with enough time any outcome is possible there."
