1812,"I was just a little let down by the Ganon fight, and overall I don't think this story will be as memorable as previous games, but I've had an absolute blast from the start.

One thing I absolutely love this game for is despite the fact that I've now beat Ganon twice (so I could get the all memories ending) I still want to get back in and play some more. I've never really had a Zelda game where I want to keep playing immediately after Ganon. Usually I put the game down for a long time before coming back. But not this time. I've still got about 80 shrines and so much more exploring to do. Not to mention there are apparently 900 Korok seeds to go find, and they all count towards 100%....

Overall, my thoughts on the game are a 10/10, but the game is not without flaws to me. The dungeons, while really cool (moving the dungeon around is one of the coolest things ever) will not stand out as much imo, because they lack distinctive themes that past Zelda dungeons had. For instance, while there's a dungeon in Zora's Domain, it's not a Water Temple. Likewise, there's no Fire Temple at Death Mountain. The change to the traditional dungeon format was obviously in line with making the dungeons part of the actual open world, and for that I will give props to Nintendo. This world is 100% connected. There are almost no spots that are seperate instances from the rest of the game. Which reminds me that I have almost never been as immersed in a video game as I am when I play BoTW. The sound design is some of the best I've ever heard in a video game, and while i've seen several people have issue with the minimalist sound track, I absolutely love it. One other gripe I've seen is with the voice acting, but after hearing all the voiced characters (I think) I actually wish the whole game had been voiced, and I really hope that this will happen with the next Zelda. 

tl;dr Game is amazing, Nintendo truly excelled at this game and I can't get enough of it. I was hoping for more with the story, but I'm not gonna let it bring down my opinion of this game. 10/10, game of the decade."

2316,"You don't lose your save if you take a wrong turn in the lost woods. As for the location of the forest, head towards death mountain, but stay west of it. The forest is North of Hyrule castle and  west of death mountain. If you get the correct tower, you'll be able to see the area on your map plain as day. It can be tricky to navigate the lost woods, so be prepared for some trial and error.

Edit: correction on the area of the lost woods"

2775,"Yeah the story just has so much left open and the trailers really made me think the actual story of the game was going to be so much more. I really like the concept of going back to collect links memories and see his past experiences, but I was really hoping for much more with those characters and they just ended up being spirits. Really helpful spirits though."
