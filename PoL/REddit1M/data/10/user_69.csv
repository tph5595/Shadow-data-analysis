56361,"While I would have appreciated more memorable music in general, I do have to say that it being used sparingly made the constant stream of jaw-dropping music in the last hour of the game incredible. Going from ambient noise to a booming, beautiful Hyrule Castle theme got me really amped up for those final fights. Also: riding in to storm Hyrule Castle with ancient arrows in my quiver and the Master Sword on my back is the most exciting moment that I've ever experienced in a Zelda game. 60-odd hours of preparation were paying off, and it was incredible. I'll have to let the game settle in my mind before I make any statements that I can't take back about it, but I'll just say at the moment that it's *really* good all the way through. "
