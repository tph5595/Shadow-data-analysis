23004,"I am a teacher at a school for grades 1-10. Iâ€™m in my late twenties, and every day I see kids 8, 9, 10-years-old wearing some kind of clothing with a triforce on it. 

It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy inside, because when I was 8 and 9 and 10, I drew triforces on anything I could manage to get a sharpie to, particularly the backs of my hands. 

I wonder how many more generations of kids are going to grow up on these games and stories. "
