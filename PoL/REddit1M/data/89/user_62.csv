21381,"I remember seeing this picture before release and just getting chills. Kind of made me remember an interview with Miyamoto in which he mentioned how he finally was able to see his original vision for the series become reality, since he couldn't do that on the NES. 

I know people shit on the game, but everytime I used to play Zelda when I was younger my imagination would make me believe the world was like that of BotW, and now I finally have had the ability to play just what I was thinking. This picture is just something that always kind of lets my love for the series come full circle in many ways. 

Here's hoping they can bring the BoTW engine in with the all the epic aspects and dungeons of the prior 3D games. "
