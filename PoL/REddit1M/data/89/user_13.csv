8042,Heres hoping to collaborating on pokemon for the adventurous feeling thats semi vanished since it turned to 3D. I mean even gen 5 had it and thats not my fav.
12581,I dont think itd work well with current levels and power scaling. Maybe if they managed to make you leave your pokemon each region but it'd feel like an anthology. I mean gen 2 is my favourite and its fun exploring kanto again too. But the badges are so easy and fast to beat and you can wander the region from the get go.
14111,Well yea i dont think order matters much. But its just that pokemon level to 100. And most evolve below lvl 50. And generally going through ome region you hit lvl 60-70. I mean trting to cram more than 2 regions in a hundred levels isnt easy. And even if they made it max lvl 200 i mean most pokemomln fully evolve at 30-40 and stop learning moves by 70-80 so itd get kind of boring.
14282,I mean i have no issue with after you finish a region having access to your other pokemon obviously. But its still basically an anthology at that point. I mean itd be cool for them to do a duo region again. But we aren't gonna get that yet. I want a fix to difficulty and the xp rates with the new exp share. And the open world exploration feeling and less story. Sun and moon felt small like just running area to area to the objective
15233,"I mean uncapped evs for single player. But if you did that itd get to the point where fire blast wouldnt do much damage. Plus a charm in rpgs is when leveling or getting stronger gives more than just stats. Like moves or evolutions. But  keep in mind that there is a reason tackle hardly does anything at higher levels. If you had infinite stat growth even hyper beam would be weak. And they arent gonna do something like change all the formulas. 

Tho i like revolutionary stuff. I mean gen 2 has special att/def split and 2 types. 3 had abilities. 4 had phys special split. 5 had hidden abilities. 6 had new type and megas. 7 had... z moves... which are kind of lame."
15495,"Yes a anthology would be nice eventually. Doubt we'd get fresh remakes but ability to put transfer stuff between would be nice.

 I'm a huge huge fan of the new xp share except with traded boosted xp meaning one pokemon is never needed to be used. Its too easy to overlevel over even the gyms tho, they need to fix it. That's a scaling issue. Turning it off slows leveling too much. 

And i meant how areas feel cramped and you dont have tons of side caves to explore. Ie sinnoh had mt. Coronet which was huge and tons of off the besten path areas like iron island. They said not to expect too much which probably means it will be one region."
15593,Megas are kind of weird. I mean i guess it makes sense as if they were evos they'd be too OP. But zmoves are just kind of lame. You cant use em with megas. Its gimmicky sadly. While obviously theyre powerful.
18066,The challenges were hard. Usually cuz it was 2 on one and just they  were competently leveled. The trainerswere easy. And i forgot. Sun and moon has alolan pokemon. Which they were real cool. Too bad it's literally like 10 pokmon not counting evolutions from gen 1.
18142,Ye but level too slowly and you dont feel rewarded. I mean early pokemon is so fun because you learn new moved every few levels and level up every other battle. And then evolve and bam. To stall that out could be a problem.
18267,They'd need a new good system. I mean they could make it too level 1000 if they wanted but at that point itd be a grind. But if they made levelimg easier then what's the point if level 1-100 takes rhe same time as 1-1000 on a new system. I mean they need to iron it out well and it'd need evolutions spaced apart better. Which would help the forgettable middle evos at times.
18536,"I mean gen 2 had 2 new types added and changed the type chart and made special into two stats. So it's basically a fixed version. Gen 3 added abilities which is huge. Gen 4 did the phsycial special split that wasnt just based on type and added a ton of new options for special fighting etc. And gen 5 added hidden abilities and stuff which was nice. Gen 6 added some online features and 3D and megas which are eh. Gen 7s zmoves and laughable number of alolan pokemon (theres only like 10 and their all gen 1 no dark luxray/typhlosion sadly). So yea innovation has stalled. But I'd say gens 2-4 were all great. 5 and 6 alright too.

Hopefully now that pokemon isnt all thats keeping nintendo afloat they slowdown and imrpove."
18841,Yea i liked gen 4s exploring of like iron island and just tons of optional areas. But yes better online would be nice. I hope it'll get there with nintendos online service.
18991,Yea the early evolutions are laughable because of the new xp share ans terrible scaling. Gen 2 has the best progression as you finally get through to like the elite four and youre only level 50 usually. But levels arent everything in pokemon anyways. Ivs ams evs play a big role already. Just they aremt gonna do it this game likely.
22767,"Gen 2 is my fav. Gen 4 second. I haven't finished sun or moon. I did X and Y but thats because i was playing with friends in uni. Gen 4 platinum is pretty good. Or diamond and pearl. Has one of the toughest elite 4 and champion too.

I got sick of gen 3. Idk why. I played it a lot but i just have gripes with the late game after the 5th badge. Aka too much water."
31148,"I like the 3D but i think the 3ds limited it. I mean youre more zoomed in and areas feel smaller. You run into a new city every 3 feet im the beginning of alola. I liked the alola pokemon idea but they only did like 10 from gen 1.

I liked gen 4 also. The rival was good. The region ans exploring things finding all the legendaries like giratima and cressalia was awesome. Gen 1 had its issues too. But i like open ended exploring focus. Pokemon is about the adventure. Like gen 1-5 (admittably gen 5 i had things i dont like but the exploring is good)"
