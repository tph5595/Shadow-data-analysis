79427,"Skyward Sword is not just a bad Zelda game, it's a bad ""game."" One of the most restrictive, uninspired, paint-by-numbers video games I have ever played."

96574,"I didn't explain my view very well. I agree that it was set up as a story of redemption, *initially.* And I liked how Groose changed his tune and started aiding you. But after that, I think it would have been awesome, in a bittersweet and heartbreaking way, if Groose had been taken over by Demise (maybe Demise needed a human vessel to manifest in the world, or maybe Groose sacrificed himself somehow and merged with Demise as a result) and they became a single being. It would have made so much sense and been so appropriate. For one, Groose... already looked like Ganondorf. Like, that couldn't have been a coincidence. And two, it would have been thematically appropriate since Groose had been an antagonist to Link and Zelda for most of his life. It would have been a much more appropriate explanation for why these 3 people are stuck in this endless cycle of reincarnation and conflict, because they all would have come from the same place and had prior history that fueled the conflict. As it is, Demise is just... some random demon that Nintendo drummed up who got really pissed off at Link and Zelda and opted into this cycle of reincarnation.

Agree or disagree, but I think my version of the story would have been way more appropriate and way more interesting."
