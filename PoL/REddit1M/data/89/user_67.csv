22511,"Just think of z-moves as a mega for your attacks. The nice thing about z-moves was that *every* Pokemon could use them, unlike mega Pokemon and fused Pokemon (Kyurem's forms and Necrozma's forms) which were only available to a small number of Pokemon for obvious reasons. 

I think I like z-status moves better than the damaging ones to be honest. There are some interesting new things you can do with those thanks to the effects they give, such as z-memento healing whoever you switch in next or z-rain dance granting a speed boost to set up a water type Pokemon like Manaphy. Get a tail glow in with that and it's game over.

The dancing animation for z-moves might be pretty stupid but the battle animations for them are pretty cool you have to admit. I remember seeing Bloom Doom for the first time and thinking how freaking cool that was. Plus every other rpg has that one ""limit breaker"" or ""special"" or ""final"" attack. This is basically Pokemon's way of doing that."
54718,I think they made the Dueling Peaks in BOTW *because of* this image. It was their original inspiration.
54844,"Back then they weren't known as anything other than some random mountains in a piece of artwork. This image was what inspired them to create the Dueling Peaks in BOTW. 

So technically the mountains in this image are the Dueling Peaks, but they didn't start that way. "
55106,"In the old image, those mountains were just generic mountains, not meant to look like anything in the game. If you have to, you can just assume they're further north than the in-game map shows.

But the game designers did create the Dueling Peaks because they were inspired by the mountains in this image. So those mountains weren't originally anything special, but now that they've directly inspired the Dueling Peaks mountains in the actual game it's fair to now call the mountains in that image the Dueling Peaks as well."
55476,If you climb to the top of the plateau (Mt Hylia in the cold area) you'll meet the Old Man there and he'll just give you the sweater. I did that before finding his cabin actually so I never had the chance to do his recipe puzzle.
