Itâ€™s like a modern interpretation. "
10273,"While I do love that Zelda has returned to its roots, I think it's pretty subjective to say that Zelda lost its charm. Don't get me wrong, I love BotW. It's honestly one of the best games I have ever played. But it is missing a lot of things that made the modern 3D Zelda games so great. 

I miss the huge puzzle-box style dungeons that had individual personalities and took hours to finish. I miss the booming overworld music, however I have seen many arguments in favor of BotW's atmospheric music that make a lot of sense. I feel there was a lot more variety in past enemy design as well, and the final boss fights felt uninspired. 

That all being said, BotW has the best overworld, exploration, and fun-factor of any of the games to date and is a great reboot to the series. "
10349,Great find! I've never seen this article. These are some really cool comparisons.

The second photo is a recreation of the same photo using landmarks from the new game, showing the similarity between the two.

We finally got the game that the art was advertising!"
18602,Thats a fair point! Although Darknuts would fit perfectly in Hyrule Castle.
18747,Definitely. After a while I got sick of the same little guardians everywhere ðŸ˜…

Please explain, I've never had any issues with the early zeldas being broken. "
21541,"Amen to that. I hope to see a sequel in the same world or at least some huge expansions. I would love to see some of the emptier parts of Hyrule filled with content.

So much potential for an already great game. "
