30656,"I hate the hand holding in the newest ones. Every step you take it’s like you’re expected to be there. Back in Red, as Red, if you ran into your rival, it’s because he got there first and you two battled it out to prove who’s better. Now it’s all about best friends journeying through together and completing a set series of tasks. It’s like they’re just admitting to how the game is programmed and giving you no feel of you’re following your own path. 

They’re more or less exactly the same, just the newest games are just flat out admitting what they are. Your goal was to collect 8 badges and Giovanni stood in the way of that and did bad things you needed to stop. Now you’re just dragged along into Lily’s shit all so you can end up forcibly meeting Solgaleo/Lunala. There was nothing like seeing the Cerulean cave is no longer being blocked and fighting your way to the Mewtwo that awaited at the end. 

The island system makes me sick. Nothing could be more linear. Give me an open world with restrictions then once I get the certain item that removes those restrictions I’m free to advance, even if it’s some old bastard with a hangover. Don’t have Lily waiting there telling me where the fuck to go. Story is bullshit and has ruined Pokémon. Pokémon died after Platinum.
