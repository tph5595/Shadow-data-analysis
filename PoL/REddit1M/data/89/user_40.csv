18510,"&gt; I feel there was a lot more variety in past enemy design as well

I read a good point on why this is: weapon durability. To make that whole system work, you need to have enemies drop weapons. So you’re forced to use humanoid enemies that can plausibly hold them - hence the big three. I suppose Darknuts would work for this, but they don’t quite fit thematically (where would you put them?). And the enemies that don’t drop weapons - Keese, Chuchus, and Octoroks - are all killed in one hit. "
