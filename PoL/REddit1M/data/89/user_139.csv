81147,"ALL regions? For one it'd be way, WAY to long. There's 8 regions now, each with a complete story, gyms and Pokemon League. They could condense them but that would make each region feel rushed, like ""hey it's Sinnoh, okay enough of that, onto Unova!"". And level scaling would be fucked. You'd have to have each region only be around a certain level, which wouldn't work because the player would become overleveled and bored quickly, or, each region levels up as normal, which also wouldn't work because by the third or so region the player would, again, be super overleveled. Each region has it's own version of certain pokemon, and seeing all those pretty much back to back would get really tiresome. 

So yeah, those are some reasons"
