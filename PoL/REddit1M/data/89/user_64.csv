21945,Were any of the games ever hard? I only played the first two generations but I never lost to a gym leader. I usually just plowed through with one pokemon. Even a water gym I would just destroy as Charizard with maybe a little help
22069,It's probably my least favourite Zelda since the ones before LTTP because of that and a few other reasons. It barely felt like the same game to me. Was really disappointed.
22091,The story is good either way. Fi's portions can be annoying but they dont change the story.
22284,"lol a list of bugs is fucking ridiculous. I NEVER ran into bugs in any of the games and I played them NUMEROUS times. You can find the bugs if you try and that is how some of the speedrunning is done but they do not hamper the games in the slightest. This is just so false. 

On top of that they aren't hard at all. OOT which it sounds like you were talking (but even if you arent it is the same in all of them) about is not hard and it teaches you as you play. Just like every other one. Talking to NPCs and they teach you controls. All the games after did the same thing. My GF who is horrible at 3d games passed at least two dungeons before getting bored and she didnt die that often.

BotW was way more likely to kill you early on with the moblins often taking 3/4 of your life in a hit. That isn't ""fun"" game mechanics. That is just stupidly strong enemies designed to be a bit cheap"
93616,Wow we got completely different things out of that story. The story was being setup as a redemption story... not as a fall from grace
97848,It could have been interesting I suppose if done right. I liked it as is but it may have been good
