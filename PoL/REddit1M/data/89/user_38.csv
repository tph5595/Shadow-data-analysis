I’m not sure exactly how they’d do it either, but they’d have to rework the entire game for it to be possible. I’m willing to bet it’ll either never happen or at least not happen like people hoped."
17706,Sun &amp; Moon were just really disappointing for me because they were so damn easy. I want to fight a gym leader and be afraid I might lose if I’m not prepared.

I don’t think you even fought a trainer with 6 Pokémon until close to the Elite Four in the new games. Each trainer had 1-3 Pokémon on average and even the leaders had like 4 at the most. That plus the new Pokémon affection system that gives your guys a HUGE advantage over the NPCs makes the game seem like it was designed for a 6 year old who had never played a Pokémon game before."
