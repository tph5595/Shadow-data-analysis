Now you have a TOTALLY SEPARATE CONSOLE with no relationship with the old ones, and even if you wanted to limit trading to avoid both bugs and being overpowered, that technology is like... 30 seconds of programming as compared to in the past where they would have to literally develop the entire platform with that in mind.

I don't think anyone would complain about lack of trading between 3ds and switch, if it meant a game with even 2 regions, much less ALL of them."
18297,"This is the first Zelda game I didn't hate. I was too young/didn't have a chance to play the original when I was younger, so by the time I started gaming, at least pseudo-3D graphics were common (my first was Pokemon Yellow when I was 6, but that held my hand enough that I could keep up the grind even when I was too young and dumb to understand). I also never really had Nintendo consoles--my parents both worked with PCs, so I had plenty of games there, and whenever I was presented with games in my younger years, I always felt disappointed because they felt 5 years behind PC releases. Even the original smash bros, which was admittedly fun, didn't really strike me as all that fun.

Then as I got older and started to appreciate those old games, I could play them for a few minutes, and then get bored because (let's admit it) they were broken as fuck and suffered from the same thing most early games did--the mechanics were not pervasive, controls for some of those mechanics are not well fleshed out, and they aren't pretty enough to grab you anyway. So I would start, and not have even the vague feelings of nostalgia that my older cousins held on to.

But I bought this game because people who I GREATLY respect, who love similar games to what i do, said this was good.

I'm maybe 20 hours in, have quite a few temples, and I'm not even playing the main quest much aside from the village and research lab. I taught a lot of my friends how to beat the guardians early on and genuinely felt like a fucking genius for figuring it out. It's such a cool experience, and exploring what works and what doesn't. When I realized carrying a burning weapon kept you warm in the cold early on, I knew it was something special.

I plan to complete this, to the end, with every temple, and then buy the DLC. I love it."
18568,"I'm not saying it's simple, exactly. Just that the idea that someone evolves at level 16 is outdated and only based on old standards that don't have to persist.

Of course they would need a new system. Bit people seem stuck on this ""butterfree by level 10"" system which doesn't HAVE to exist. Levels aren't a thing in anything but the gameboy games. We now have a fully developed console that is ready for a TOTALLY developed new system. This is the perfect time to do it."
19521,"Are you honestly trading up all the Pokemon you've used since you first played red?

Because honestly, except to complete a pokedex, I've never done that. And honestly? I would SO much rather play a game where all 700-some are catchable, regardless of region, than another region where a doorbell or a laptop is the new Pokemon. We are at a point where no reasonable, even semi-devoted fan can name every single one. Why not put them in the game fans are asking for?

It doesn't even have to be *every* region. Just multiple, fun regions. Or even just a new one which gives us good enough reason to explore and keep playing.

By holding on to Pokemon you got in gen one, you're essentially the person CREATING this barrier. Fucking WHY??? It's not like you can't go back to those games. But sometimes, you need to separate from everything--not just the poor design, but the FUCKING BUGS introduced previously. It's fine. No need to freak out. Give it one generation of genuine, good change and I promise you forget this exchange."
21739,"So without much research, [here](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda_Glitches) is a basic list of bugs, but these are not the real issues. Most of the problems come with not knowing how to properly balance a game--i.e., if you can die I  the first 3 screens, and there's no real understanding of what you could have done better, there's a problem. A lot of this ""broken""ness comes from my own (And many others') experience of living in a world where understanding the basic mechanics of a game wasn't considered ""exploration."" Another example is that many considered the discovery that holding ""B"" made Mario run to be a method of ""discovery."" When developing the standards of gaming that might be true, bit introduce it to a modern audience and you may as well call that broken. At best, you can call it an ""Easter egg""--but not if it's essential to the game.

For my own experience, I literally didn't get the first sword until I died 5 times. I kept exploring and avoiding enemies, because I was trying new ways to go. It was easy to explore, but saving was not great... So I could move a few screens, as other games have taught me to do, but I could not determine where I needed to be. I realize that in context, this game was ground breaking and CREATED the tropes that were confusing me, but that's along the lines of people who say Citizen Cane is still a good movie. It's pretty good, but only because it was groundbreaking FOR ITS TIME. Show it to most modern audiences and they will get it immediately and say it's boring and poorly crafted, because it is only great in the context that other creations of that time in the same medium didn't have that level of depth and creativity.

There is value there, but it's overhyped by people who are more driven by nostalgia than realistic thought."
22785,"I'm talking about literally the first game. ""The Legend of Zelda."" That first sentence is just to state that the idea that there are ZERO bugs is false, but the rest describes exactly the problems with the first game.

What's more, you're not addressing any of the issues I mentioned, which tells me that you stopped after that one link to play ""LMAO U DON'T KNOW GAEMS THO"" with me. Listen. I explained to you why modern gamers would find the original to be lacking. You are still caught in those nostalgia lenses, which is why you refuse to see the issues I had.

Not only that, but you're right! I died a good 5-10 times in BotW before I developed an effective countermeasure for the first guardian I found. I died a LOT. But I was never confused as to why. In the original game, I WAS--and that's as someone who was already into gaming at that point (we are talking early 2000s). Sure, at the time, I'm sure you felt super awesome discovering how to NOT DIE, but by the time I was playing it, a cave was basically ""no man's land"" in games, until you were ready to fight for your life. In its infancy, maybe it was amazing, but the original game does not age as well as you think it does, unless your firmly place your faith in nostalgia. "
23381,"So first and foremost,

A connection with something you're passionate about and which you have devoted a lot of time, research, energy, etc. Into is not dumb. Thinking of a bunch of code as ""friends,"" however, is. They're not your friends, any more than books, or, instruments, or sportsballs can be your friends. I realize that's harsh, but it's a reality. If you need a friend, I'm free to chat, and unlike your garbador, if you die tomorrow it will genuinely bother me and I will help you talk through whatever is on your mind if you need it.

So that said, no one said those values have to go away. The switch is just generally a more powerful console than the 3ds. It can do more, so it should do more, just like the Wii and Wii U should have. But for the first time in a while, it seems like those changes could ACTUALLY HAPPEN. I don't feel like encouraging a new system which moves away from the outdated system, based on mechanics older than most of the people playing, should be treated as some kind of godsend. It can change. It should change. Even you, as someone who has devoted their life and time to it, sees the need for change. So maybe this is the time to do it. Rip that band aid, and let a new era reign supreme. If it's that good, you won't need your old Pokemon anymore. And honestly, if you're so attached to them at this point that you can't think of life beyond them, you need help beyond what I can offer. They're an investment in your time and interest but they aren't your life--or at least they shouldn't be. If the idea of game mechanics changing scares you, you have a problem."
25690,"I could potentially agree, but I never got far enough to know for sure.

In my opinion, the problem NOW is that we have too much experience when approaching a video game to be able to feel accomplished with ANY part of the game. For example, can you imagine if in GTA V, there was no discussion of any mechanics, and the only thing that was standard was the joystick for movement? Then consider how much harder it would be without button prompts. How do I get into cars? CAN I get into cars? Can I shoot? Pick up guns? How do I switch guns? And how am I supposed to figure out the basics of my special ability, if it's not presented through a tutorial of some sort?

The original LoZ existed in a world where mechanics were simple, and there was not an assumed zeitgeist in gaming which said ""A is jump, B is attack."" Hell, at the time ""start to pause"" wasn't standard. In some ways, I think about it like the first time I played portal. I was dealing with people who understood the basics of video gaming enough to fully know how my first actions would look intuitively, and as such were able to craft an experience which plays off of those expectations to make a unique experience. The people who made TloZ we're likely similar, but programming for a gamer in 1986 is way different than a game in 2016, as it should be.

I'm sure if I was play TloZ when it was first released I would feel differently, but by the time I reached it it was outdated--thus the Citizen Cane reference."
26735,"Sure, but I never had the chance to have FUN learning to play the old Zelda games. They often suffer from this issue of nostalgia that a described, where people think of them as these beautiful perfect games because they WERE when they came out.

Modern example. Most people LOVED the original Mass Effect, myself included. Many people still swear by it today. Frankly I find it unplayable nowadays. That's just how games develop.

If you saw a silent film today, you might appreciate many of them for their historical impact, but I doubt you would list any of them as your ""favorite movie."" I feel games should be the same way. Some day, someone will release a WAY better version of ""Portal."" At that point, I can acknowledge that I loved Portal when it came out and that it was ground breaking, but I can guarantee that by that time, it will be embarrassing and simplistic in comparison. Hell, Portal 1 feels that way compared to portal 2, and I struggle playing 1 now having lived through 2. It's just how the world works. We build off each other's successes. It's important to acknowledge the history, but not to overglorify it."
