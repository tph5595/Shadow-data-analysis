It's good to keep the player contained to the same area while they learn how the game functions, but since they're still learning how to navigate the Plateau seems so much bigger than it actually is. At least I thought so, it felt giant to me at first."

I've only gotten a handful so far, but it feels so amazing to have to track down a location with the only information you have being the landmarks you can spot in a photo. It's even better that it's optional, it's just ""Do you want to explore the world and try and find these places? Okay, here's a tiny hint of what you can see from the spot. Go find it."" When I found the first one using nothing but the picture, it felt amazing. It's great for the game too, because it reinforces exploration as that's how you complete the quest and rewards you for taking in the amazing scenery and having mental notes of where large landmarks are. All that would be lost if there were just 12 waypoints to show you where to go, so glad that's not the case."

I saw the recipie but didn't have any meat so I just moved on, and then later found out that you could cook with the spicy peppers to get meals that had cold resistance. I loaded up and did that entire section with pepper and mushroom meals, and when I beat the shrine the old man gave me the doublet as a reward for getting that far without it. It was good because I did not have any spicy meals left to get back XD. Really liked how there were multiple ways to solve that portion."
