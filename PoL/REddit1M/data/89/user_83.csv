25595,I'd love to see them try something really ambitious with a new pokemon on switch. Like bring in elements of big modern day open world RPG's with a style similar to the new Monster Hunter World game. Let it be its own stand alone thing and maybe only use the first 2 or 3 generations of pokemon. Would be tough to get right but I could see it being huge.
