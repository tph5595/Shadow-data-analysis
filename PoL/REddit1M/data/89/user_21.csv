12050,"Man I wish they could put all the regions in one game, I can’t think of any possibility on how that would work, I’d just like to see everything with updated visuals. And the world would be huge! Plus, catching all Pokémon in their natural habitats just sounds so sweet!"
13662,"I had an idea about the return of the dream world, each region is a “dream” and once you finish a region, you can access the previous regions through the dream world to get your Pokémon back. Same character, just wake up in a different region in different clothes each time you beat the elite four, and you can always go back to that region for post elite four content and things that you missed."
14654,"Accessing each region on one cart still sounds great, wouldn’t mind an anthology if everything could cross over, no matter what region you’re in and which one you’re going to.

XP share I don’t have problems with, because I can just turn it off if I don’t want to play on easy mode, and while SuMo was linear, it was only slightly more linear than other titles, most of the other games have had many areas blocked off until you reach a certain point. Though, I will say it’d be very fun if it took a BotW route and making objectives completable in any order you want before the elite four. That just requires a lot of reworking of every area in the game (based on previous regions, a new region might fare better) and I don’t really see it being a possibility for the next game, but who knows, I could be wrong "
47572,"Graphics can definitely overhauled compared to SuMo, I’m not too worried about what it’s going to look like, though it would be really cool if you could see the Pokémon in the world as opposed to random encounters. Though I did hear that GameFreak said not to expect too much, so it’s probably another game in the main series that follows tradition, with some graphical enhancements from SuMo"
78819,Why wouldn’t it work?
91928,"So going back to my dream world idea, the levels wouldn’t have to scale since you wouldn’t be able to access Pokémon from previous regions until you finish the current one. Yes, that’s a little annoying for those who want all their Pokémon all the time, but I could see it working.

Secondly, too long? I get seeing the same Pokémon over and over is tiresome, but the argument that something is too long is, I don’t know, unfair? How could you not want more content in the game you’re paying so much money for? I feel like, back to the dream world idea, that you only need to play through one region (which you can choose to start in as your “main region”) to “beat” the game, where the other regions are entirely optional. Sure the dream world is kind of a lame concept, but if it were to return, that is the only way I see a game like this working. "
