Honestly I'd just rather one really well-done region than multiple... "

I value the time I've spent with my Pokemon greatly and treat them as friends (in absence of proper friends at several points) so there's that.

The amount of time I've put into getting the living dex, working on getting all hidden abilities, forms, etc., and the huge amount of time spent making competitive Pokemon...I would hate for that to all go to waste.

Not to say that I wouldn't mind shaking up the formula (IVs can go, they don't do much except act as a barrier), but to be faced with having to let everything be left in the past...I don't want to do that again. I just... Don't.

Plus, like I said with the regions thing, Game Freak regularly messes up with 1 region. I do not want them trying to balance around several. "
