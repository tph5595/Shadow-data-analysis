Botw got one play through and a trade in."
29221,"The point I made was less about the top art, more about the idea that botw deserves the praise. It doesn't. It feels like a dated open world game from 2008-2011 that only has a few slight redeeming qualities"
30420,"Oddly it's the zelda ip that's carried it.

1st games of a type played to completion.

Open world is either Lttp or Morrowind depending on your definition

Story involving amnesia. Star wars Kotor

Hack and slash lite probably goes to fable or Majora's mask depending on your definition

3d Platform puzzle goes to either Mario 64 or something in that era. Hard to say, but I was more ps1 then 64, but m64 came to mind

Weapon durability goes to Morrowind. And it was implemented better by so many.

Trying to think of a feature to give to Botw, and honestly can't.  But I will give it props where it's due. The sound design is on point, and for a portable game it is acceptable. But I doubt it was worth the 70-80cdn I paid for it. If I still had a rental option that was probably a 1 7day rental at best"
73382,"It didn't do anything better was the point. It used a bunch of mechanics I had long since gotten over the hype of and did so in a stale way. The literal only amazing thing was the dragons before I realized they weren't a boss fight, but instead a part farm. A game of wasted potential"

Oddly  it was the Vita's abysmal failure that left me wanting something portable"
