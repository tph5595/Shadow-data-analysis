23614,"I'm hoping they change up the system a bit for the next Pokemon.  Let a pokemon keep all its moves, but have things like wind-up and cooldown times for the moves, ATB-style turn meters (so for example a Pikachu could potentially get 4 or 5 attacks against that Snorlax before getting hit back because it has 4 or 5 times the speed), things like that.  I see no reason in-universe why a pokemon should only have 4 moves (that's just a limitation of the original game boy!) or why a Snorlax's gets the same number of attacks in a battle as a Pikachu, it just attacks last."
