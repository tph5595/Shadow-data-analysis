26499,"lol, when did Zelda ""lose it's charm""? Did you even play the more recent Zeldas? Every game is Amazing, Nintendo doesn't cheap out on it. That's why they have 300 franchises and everyone else is lucky to have 2. "
102744,"The literal number is 30ish last I checked - Kid Icarus, Metroid, FZero, Mario, Donkey Kong, Smash Bros, Mario Kart, Mario Party, Pokemon, Zelda, Kirby, Animal Crossing, the list goes on and on. 

Most companies are lucky to have two if they don't have generic sports franchises. It's a joke."
