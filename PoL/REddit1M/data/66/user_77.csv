25646,Meanwhile Original link is sitting there like... dudes... I've been jumping whenever I want for over 30 years now...
25745,"Wind can be hatless during ""new game plus""  
tho he should be wearing his lobster shirt in that case."
25790,"Well that's not ""jumping whenever""  
that's using an item.  

Only Original Link and BotW Link have been able to jump whenever."
25869,"Second place is a 4-way tie, Hero of Art (ALBW and TFH) and Original Link (LoZ and AoL)  also both have 2 games under their belts."
25985,"He is the only Link with atleast 4 (known) adventures on his record, possibly more.  
Also he beat Ganon with the full triforce without having any pieces himself and not even any real support.  

He is often considered the most bad ass one feat-wise as a result"
46849,"You are indeed wrong.  
Tri Force Heroes is confirmed to star the same Link as ALBW."

47839,"TBF to you tho, TFH has the least clear indication of it being a sequel out of any of the games with a shared Link   
In-game pretty much the only thing to really point at it is that the merchant  from ALBW is in it and (almost) recognizes Link.  "

77989,"The island was created out of Link's and the Wind Fish's dreams but considering Link sees the island dissappear with his own eyes at the end, that (to me) implies the island was an actual pysical place that the dream fish subconciously created in his dreams.  "
