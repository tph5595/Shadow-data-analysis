12758,The Link in Smash is a doll/trophy brought to life to fight others for the entertainment of Master Hand and/or themselves. It's not the real Link.
14644,"According to his tunic set that you get from completing all 120 shrines, he's the Hero of the Wild. (And the Amiibo outfits confirm the Hero of Time, Hero of Twilight, Hero of the Wind, and Hero of the Sky. The NES Link's outfit is just called the Tunic Of The Hero, unfortunately.)"
14710,"LTTP Link was also the protagonist of Oracle of Ages, Oracle of Seasons, and Link's Awakening. No clue where the original Link is, though."

57231,"Huh, I just compared the SSBB and SSB4 Links, and you're right, he has the same general appearance. They just made him brighter, which (combined with SKyloft being a stage) made me think of Skyward Sword. Nice catch, editing."
57392,"Right, at least in the first game, but from the in-universe perspective of the characters from Subspace Emissary, it's hard to say who they're actually fighting to entertain. There's apparently a crowd at the stadium right at the beginning, but you can't really tell what they are, other than maybe random Mario enemies, and who knows what their role in the World of Trophies is when there's no fight happening."
57416,Good point! I'll add it.
