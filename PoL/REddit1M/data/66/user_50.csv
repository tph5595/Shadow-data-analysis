17534,I love how Twilight Link is an obnoxious asshole. It really suits the pretentiousness of the game he's from.
59226,The comic literally has Twilight Link barge into the house obnoxiously and yelling obscenities like he think's he's special. That completely fits the game he's from. Twilight Princess is the most pretentious game in the series. Both things I said are completely relevant to the comic and game.
60124,"&gt; Twilight Princess is the best game in series.

This is an opinion and it actually perfectly illustrates my point. It's pretentious because I don't think it deserves the praise it gets. People treat the game like it's the second coming of Jesus when it has numerous glaring flaws and completely rides on the success of Ocarina of Time. It directly steals a lot of things from Ocarina of Time without changing anything and it really does nothing new of its own, aside from Wolf Link which was clearly added before they could think of any gameplay reason for it to be there."
67907,"&gt; It doesnâ€™t ride on the success of OOT any more than OOT rides on the success of the four defining titles that came out before it

The entire reason that Twilight Princess was created was because people disliked the art direction and theme of Wind Waker. They were upset that Nintendo was moving away from the realistic art direction of Ocarina of Time. It had also been two console Zelda releases since a Zelda game was the typical format of a Zelda game set in a typical Hyrule with everything that came with it. 

The whole point of Twilight Princess was to go back to the massive success that was Ocarina of Time. But while Zelda games general take influence from other games in the series, Twilight Princess is literally just a complete knock-off of Ocarina of Time, doing nearly everything that *is* did. No other Zelda game has done this. [Here] (https://youtu.be/cXOgL6sYzDY?t=1336) is an idea of what I'm talking about.

You're free to like Twilight Princess if you want. Most people do. I just don't want my games to be complete retreads of others. Every Zelda game adds many things to make it unique compared to the others. The only thing like this in Twilight Princess is the wolf and there was no reason for it to be there outside of the story. It was clearly added before they could think of any real use for it, unlike other Zelda ""gimmicks"" like time travel, season change, or turning into a painting. The games that these mechanics are from do tons of things with the idea. The only use for the wolf is smelling for people, which you only do once or twice, and combat, which is inferior to human Link combat in nearly every way."
