""Thereâ€™s three answers to that:

One being the fans answer that he got tired of being called a woman or zelda because his hair was pink and got all buff 

Two being me: I like to think that past, being the best zelda game, got buff from holding the weight of all the shittier zelda games (looking at you,  skyward sword, CDI, spirit tracks)

The real answer: I just like to fuck with people it brings me great joy when people ask why.

You cannot stop me.""


She also told me to tell Reddit she says hi."
