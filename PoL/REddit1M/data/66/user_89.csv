32989,And buff. And wearing shades. 
33142,"Technically, Past CAN jump with the roc’s feather. I guess similar applies for the four sword boys and the cape. 

And if OG Link were there, he had some wicked jumping prowess in Adventure Of Link.

33179,Nothing you just said applies to the comic or the game though. You okay?
33303,That’s OG Link and Past Link. I think they disregarded Past Link as being the same one from Link’s Awakening and purposely excluded OG Link for the premise to hold water. 
33348,That’s Past. Awakening is ALTTP’s direct sequel. 
59564,Twilight Princess is the best game in series. I have no clue what calling it pretentious even means other than perhaps you just not understanding anything about it. Literally. 
66640,"It doesn’t ride on the success of OOT any more than OOT rides on the success of the four defining titles that came out before it- it heavily added to the engine (that almost every Zelda as well as other games have since) and added depth, scope, life and lore to Hyrule in ways that OOT couldn’t on N64. Is not as though OOT could have achieved much on the platform it was built upon, but many fans see TP as having been the proper course for the series after OOT made heavy concessions to be what it was and WW, for how great it turned out, took the series in a direction that many fans didn’t expect. TP was a homecoming for a lot of fans and although it didn’t do anything wildly new, it kinda just used aspects of every game before it to make a content heavy and comfortable core Zelda experience, which was great. Any pretentiousness you see among TP fans likely comes from the abundant OOT worship that exists only to shut down differing opinions, and only serves to counter that. The weirdly outspoken chip on your shoulder is evidence that you’ve likely been on the other side of one too many of those futile discussions. "
