27832,I dont think it was up to the zoras dude. If the goddess had a reason that was explained and atleast sorta makes sense whats the big deal? The logic in it is not in the zoras but in the goddesses keeping them from hyrule. Perhaps the gods or ganon or whatever in zelda wanted a fresh start from hyrule so they hid it from intelligent life.
