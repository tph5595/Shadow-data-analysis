19070,"Wow, when you say it like that, it's really small.

Just like Ocarina of Time has 5 areas: the Hylian sections, Kokiri section, Goron section, Zora section, and Gerudo section!

So tiny."
19236,"Fake timeline?

How do you figure it's fake when:

* Adventure of Link is a direct sequel to Zelda 1

* ALttP is a prequel to the first two games, describing where Ganon came from

* OoT is a prequel/retelling of ALttP's backstory, describing where Ganon**dorf** came from

* Wind Waker is a direct sequel to the Adult ending of OoT, detailing the results of sealing Ganon away

* Majora's Mask is a direct sequel to the Child ending of OoT

* Twilight Princess is a direct sequel to the Child ending of OoT, detailing the results of foiling Ganondorf's plans

?

Sure, there were a few that could have been placed pretty much anywhere (mainly the Four Swords games), but the majority of the timeline is pretty solid and has been **forever**.

The second game stars the same Link as the first and is a direct sequel.  The series has literally never had multiple standalone game stories.

Also, fuck remakes forever."
24747,"Well then it's a good thing all 5 of those sections together have less content, fewer hidden secrets, and are overall smaller and less interesting and explorable than a single one of Skyward Sword's zones!"
24803,"At least Skyward Sword's sections were connected by something that had interesting stuff to do in it, and not by an empty, nigh-featureless ~~plane~~ plain."
28862,"Yeah, it's not like it had ~20 hidden puzzles guarding treasure* and a dozen sidequests or anything.  :)

*Key note: better treasure than 50 rupees."
28889,"I want to say that just got turned into the Forest Temple, but I'm not sure."
31799,"Yeah, Skyward Sword made rupees actually a great reward most of the time.  Something the games have been getting better at recently, but still needs a lot of work throughout the series."
32884,There are a lot~ of broken things about Skryim.
