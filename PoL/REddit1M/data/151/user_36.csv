25452,"There was one Zora left in WW. Ganon killed her. Laruto the sage in the earth temple. She died so you had to awaken the sage that carries her bloodline. That is Medli. Medli is a descendant of Laruto, a Zora who was born in Zoras Domain before the flood. It's not redacting. It's in the game.

Also there is only one intelligent aquatic species after the flood. The Fishmen that clearly only near the surface of the water only ever have knowledge of surface happenings.

The Zora lost their ability to live in the water because the Gods wanted to get rid of Hyrule and nobody could have access to it. We also know that the rito have to learn to fly because the young rito rely on grappling hooks to get around until they have reliable flight. This suggests that flight is relatively new to the rito because its not an instinct but an acquired skill to fly.

There is tons of evidence in their design alone that the rito were always intended to be related to the Zora. Stop nitpicking. "

Also we don't know if Zoras can actually survive in sea water. We never see hylian Zoras in sea water but we do see Zoras living out of the water so maybe the salt water pushed them out and they had to learn something new? 

And lastly, flight is way more useful than swimming. Seeing as their deity is a dragon, it makes sense that since the rito are supposed to keep Valoo happy, they might want to be able to follow him should he fly off. Also since valoo likes to sit atop a mountain and the rito need to tend to him, they can't exactly swim up the mountain."
