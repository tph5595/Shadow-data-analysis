25945,"I know they're supposed to be related to the Zora. Laruto makes that perfectly clear. That's exactly *why* it bothers me. It just seems like a cop out to say ""because goddesses"" when it makes absolutely no *logical* sense for them to change into birds, and is in fact worse for them as a species in every way."
26518,Which seems like a cheap cop out to me. Would have been cooler if the Zora became the guardians of old Hyrule. Turning them into birds just feels stupid.
