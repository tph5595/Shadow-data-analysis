6157,At one point in development that very concept was thought of you would transport from The Great Sea to Hyrule via Fisher man. 
17009,"Yes, similar to skyward sword but more fleshed out. I believe Hyrule Historia actually has concepts of the system. "
37349,What I meant to say was that WW's system had more potential then what Skyward Sword system became. 
37699,"Yes it truly is. Although, can you imagine if this concept was in the final game? It could have possibly pushed Wind Waker to a new height and it could have helped the glaring problems with the overworld in Skyward Sword. "
82503,Yes I understand the limitations of the mini disc only able to hold 1.4-1.7 GB of data at the time. Now might I say that if it was as it intended it would have been a great feature but as you said limited by the disc limitation. I feel as if the it could have help the underworld as it was limited and lacked the main aspect of exploration because of how sectioned off. The concept of the underworld in Skyward Sword could have played in a more favorable position if WW had experimented with the concept before.
