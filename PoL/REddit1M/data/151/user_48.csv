29573,"Zelda archetype:

* intro 

* three ""easy"" dungeons

* plot point / change 

* five or six ""hard"" dungeons

* final fight. 

This started in a link to the past, followed into OoT, and is there for twilight princess and I think skyward sword as well (only played that one once, just didn't like the motion controls). 

Wind waker was slightly different:

* intro 

* 4 dungeons (fortress/dragon roost/deku/tower of the gods)

* plot

* 4 dungeons (earth temple/wind temple/fortress/Gannon's castle)


Overall it's standard Zelda and they were trying to change it up. I'm glad. "
431460,"That was more of an expansion than a full game. Not that I don't love Majora's Mask, but that it's development was specifically designed around reusing resources and being different. [1 year development](http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/3ds/majoras-mask-3d/0/0)
A better question would have been what about The Minnish Cap or Spirit Tracks"
