23744,It would be cool if the Wind Waker constantly did that and messed with the sails on enemy ships. Maybe in Wind Waker 2. Nintendo pls.
25577,"Since the wind direction changes with you it would be cool if that would effect enemy ships, like if you face at an oncoming ship your wind would catch its sails and slow it down.

It could create an interesting dynamic for ship to ship combat like in AC4."
