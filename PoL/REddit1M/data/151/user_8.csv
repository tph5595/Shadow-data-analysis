15661,So kind of like Skyward Sword?
17374,"Now that I think about it, having twin fully fleshed out overworlds that you can transport yourself between would be awesome. And not like in LttP where both worlds are topographically the same, it would be like in Skyward Sword where they're both unique. Throw in the teleportation from Twilight Princess and I think we have a winner. "
