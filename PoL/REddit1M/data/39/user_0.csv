4096,"You can teleport pretty close to it, so I personally wouldn't complain about it."
8099,"Wait until you find the Hylian Shield. It's not indestructible, but it might as well be. I'm waiting until I get another giant core and making the Ancient Shield to hang on the wall."
8177,I already learned that the hard way. RIP my first Five-Shot Burst Savage Lynel Bow... T-T
9855,"Super lucky with the SMB4 Zelda Amiibo. Its power is weak, but the range is deadly. No drop, and I can hit a tree on the mountain from the front door of the house."
25516,Doesn't use any arrows. It creates its own Light Arrows.
25619,"Ancient Bow is stronger, with an impressive range, but not insanely so like the Twilight Bow."
25679,Already had it cause I trained it in Smash Bros.
43484,"It does break, just takes a long time to do so. You can buy a new one if you do a side-quest regarding building a cool little town."
43847,"The Boulder Breaker is actually fairly good with it's large durability. The Lightscale Trident isn't the best, but it was amazing considering how early in the game I got it. The Scimitar of the Seven is the 3rd best sword (when regarding both attack and durability stats), and the Great Eagle bow is a decent bow with respectable range.

At least you can get them over and over easily. I feel like having 4 weapons, 1 bow and 1 shield rechargeable would be too much and would hinder the point of the weapon durability aspect of this game.

Even the Hylian Shield breaks. The Champions' weapons aren't special like the Master Sword. The weapons are special because of *who* wields it, and not the other way around."
43930,Vice versa for me. My Savage Lynel Shields are my back up for once the Hylian Shield breaks. But that's only until I buy another Hylian Shield.
43962,It removed the 5-shot and made it a normal 3-shot.
44008,You can just take it down and replace it with something else.
44027,Talk to them next to the fire in Tarrey Town.
44081,"No extra hearts. Its a free restore of health. Don't have to pay 20 rupees for it.

I rather go to the spa in Gerudo Town and get the extra 3 hearts for 80 rupees."
44171,I really hope they do this.
44265,"If I ever run low, I wait for the blood moon and massacre the White and Silver-Maned Lynels and the Major Test of Strength."
44362,"The weapons and shields won't lose durability. They have a high chance at losing their special attributes. Durability Up, Attack Up, Long Throw, Critical Chance, Five-Shot Burst, ect."
44423,"You might still have a chance at them being there. It can lose them instantly after loading a game, or it can take some time. Honestly, I still have weapons with their enchantments on the wall, but some have also lost their enchantments."
70075,"Have you done all the Tarrey Town sidequests? If you do that, they will go there temporarily. They will stay there if you DON'T talk to them there after finishing the quest line."
147015,Same..........
