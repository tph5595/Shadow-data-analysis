3936,"I wish the houses had more functionality. 4000+ rupees for what is essentially a bed. I was hoping id be able to use it as a make shift stable, make some food that could only be cooked at links home (""home made stew"", ""home made cookies"" etc) and at least be able to teleport there."

7009,How come?
