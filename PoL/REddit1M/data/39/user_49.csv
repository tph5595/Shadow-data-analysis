I like the dungeons and the story of all the others and this one has unexciting dungeons and an unexciting story. It's kinda cool how they developed characters and stuff, but character development is why I like film and books not why I like zelda, or any other, games. "

It would be so easy to siege, who puts a castle on the lowest part of the land, like where would they stage a defense if a neighboring kingdom came to wage a war (assuming they'd come by sea since theres no access elsewhere). Just a random thing that I cant stop thinking about whenever I see al the flat space around the castle."
