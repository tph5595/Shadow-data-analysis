14349,"A little off topic, but I really wish the weapons you get for completing a Divine Beast functioned like the Master Sword and recharged instead of breaking. They're decent weapons and aesthetically unique/interesting, but needing to reforge them when they break really disincentivizes their use."
15900,"But at the same time, there's no reason to use them. If they were the strongest in their categories, then yeah, that'd be busted, but they aren't even close to the Savage Lynel weapons (or the Royal ones if memory serves).

Instead, they're good to mediocre weapons that, when they break, require you to find a specific weapon and a number of diamonds to reforge. So basically, you can use a weapon that is outclassed by other (arguably easier to obtain) equipment and, every time it breaks, you need to put a decent chunk of resources into reforging, or...you don't use it. They're meant to be rewards, but they end up just being trophies.

If they worked similarly to the Master Sword, they still wouldn't be best in class for damage, but you could at least use them without it feeling like a waste of resources every time one ""breaks""."
18917,"I'd also be fine with the reforging system if the weapons were top of the line for damage. Making them a pain to reforge would at least make sense then, as they're meant to be powerful. The current implementation is in an awkward place between those two extremes"
20562,"It's not the worst thing, no, but it is a lot of trouble to go through for a weapon that is mid-tier for damage. There isn't any reason to use the Champion weapons once you can reliably farm Lynels for their drops (and probably sooner than that even, depending on the weapon in question).

I'm not saying that they should be God tier, one-shot-everything weapons, but it'd be nice if, at the end of the game, they had at least some use outside of looking nice on a wall. Having them share the recharge mechanic would do that."
20920,"My big grievance is that they're very lackluster as a reward. There isn't anything special about them that sets them apart from other weapons, aside from them being annoying to reforge, which isn't really a positive. Given that they're the weapons of the champions and received as rewards for clearing the Divine Beasts, it'd be nice if they were better than their counterparts.

If not the recharge, then give them better damage, or unique modifiers. Something to make their use worthwhile throughout the game, and not just in a ""low exploration"" run. "
