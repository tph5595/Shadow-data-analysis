I absolutely adore the game, and can spend hours wandering aimlessly, but the rewards for most quests are underwhelming"
15565,"Yea, I did a really cool and long sidequest the other night, and the reward was 300 rupees.

I thoroughly enjoyed doing the quest, but the reward was laughably bad. 1 hour to get what I could get with a strike in bowling, or by selling 3 pieces of meat."
20120,That's another silly aspect of the game. They act like 100 years is a couple of months.
32824,"Gourmet Meat, you can turn in at Outskirt stable 1 at a time for 100 a piece, but is limited as to how many you can do a day. If you cook them 5 at a time, they sell for 490 if you don't want to keep pushing the in-game clock ahead"
