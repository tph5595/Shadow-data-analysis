18609,"I was thinking this exact thing yesterday, and it only really hit me after ~60hrs. It started off with slaughtering a small village of bokoblin / moblin only to get an amber or opal (which 'has the power of water,' making me excited that it'd have some sick use down the road, but I haven't found one so far...). 

Saving people almost always gives me some food I wouldn't really use. Otherwise, rupees. If I was rewarded with awesome weapons, more rune upgrades, equipment, rare materials that *did something*, it'd be a lot more exciting."
