1037828,Maybe you're just not a zelda fan then.
1041139,It has flaws but I feel like you went through the game looking for ocarina of time instead of its own game. I know because I did the same with the trailer and I was trashing it. Also you lIke the monstrosity of Phantom Hourglass?
1042782,"I feel like an asshole now because you seem pretty chill and I agree with you about oot being the worst 3d game before BOTW.. sorry.

Linebeck is pretty cool but the ocean king temple was tiring tbh. I felt worn out going back every major event. I haven't played spirit tracks in awhile, maybe I should dig it up."
