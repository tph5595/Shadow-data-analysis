The Inn in tarrey town and the beds at the outpost in the desert and at the east resevoir lake are the same."
5824,"I think ""missed opportunities"" is one of the ways I personally would describe BotW."
8142,"Cause i was severaly dissappointed at how little BotW does despite having all the balls in its camp to be fantastic.

Has probably one of the best ""settings"" for a tragic story that makes you feel for the champions of old, and they don't do anything with it.  

Has one of the best physics-interaction systems of any game, but there are no big dungeons to make use of it for puzzles and the environment doesn't actually allow to use it either.    

Has a massive world to let you explore, doesn't actually put anything worht exploring inside of it.    

Has a story-progression system that could have allowed everyone to learn as much or as little of the story as they want and in any order  
has a weak as shit story that doesn't really show enough or anything at all really.  

Has lots of materials to gather  
Doesn't actually have a worked out crafting or upgrade system  

You can buy a house  
Only real interesting thing about it is that it sets off the Tarrey town quest.  

Has lots of gear with 'set bonusses'  
Close to none of them have any really interesting powers or techniques and several can't be upgraded.  

has lots of cool mounts  
only regular horses can be registered/kept  
also PS: epona is locked behind an amiibo LOL : GIVE US YOUR MONAYS!  
Talking about locking stuff behind an amiibo : Locks the only ""fight-compagnion"" behind an amiibo that you need to have a different game for in order to make strong.  

I could go on and on and on tbh.  "
9989,"No, I was desperately looking for reasons to love it.    
They just fucked up close to every single major aspect of Zelda games I care about.  

Resulting in one of the best open world games, but an extremely sub-par Zelda game in my eyes.  "
15362,"I don't think any one Zelda needs to have ALL the ""elements"" to be good or even great to amazing.  
But atleast a handfull of them needs to be present and well done.  

The most insanely simplified way of saying it, is that a good Zelda game makes memories and makes me feel about the stuff in it.  
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/5zgc71/botw_have_we_gamers_become_too_picky/dexxvz4/) is a comment I made about it in a thread on truezelda about 2 weeks ago.  

That is not to say that that is JUST what is missing from BotW imo.  
but it is one of the major issues I have with it.    
Imo, BotW pretty much sacrificed most of what makes a Zelda game, a Zelda game, in exchange for pandering to the open world ""hype"" in the industry atm.  
  
BotW is probably the best Engine for Zelda they have ever made.  
Now if only they actually put stuff in its world to make that engine work.  


"
17598,"Well you don't HAVE to play BotW if you don't want too I guess, it also solves the amiibo thing at the same time.  
but yeah, in order to use amiibo in BotW you will have to play Botw itself."
19627,"But the content IS locked all the same, and I'll bet more SSB Link amiibo or ones that register similar to him will pop up eventually.   
IIRC they found data for a specific Twilight princess Link amiibo in the game together with the one for the ""hero of the sky"" gear and the Fierce Deity gear, and considering SSB Link gives the twilight stuff already, it isn't unlikely that they will essentially work like SSB Toon Link and anniversary Toon Link amiibo-wise.  

And with Wolf Link it is specifically an entire mechanic locked behind an amiibo since there is no combat compagnion taming, or anything like it, in the base game.  

"
20331,"&gt; Do you think Epona should have been in the base game? It wouldn't make much sense considering she lived ~10,000 years before this game, would it? They clearly just added Epona to be an amiibo reward.

Epona reincarnates/re-appears just like every other reocurring character in the series, don't be silly and pretend she has to have been the one from OoT.  
We already have Epona existing in Minish Cap, Twilight Princess, Ocarina of Time/Majora's Mask and Four Swords Adventures.   
And potentially the oracle games' intro, but that horse is unnamed. 

And the wolf Link amiibo still has an entire mechanic locked behind it, which has nothing to do with whether Epona could fit in or not.  

&gt;
I doubt it. I've been waiting for a Donkey Kong amiibo restock for almost a year now and it hasn't happened.  

DK doesn't have a game out atm now does he ?  
also the SMB line DK almost certaintly scans in the same as the SSB Line one.  

And unless you think they just made SS and MM gear for the fun of it, then we will be seeing more 30th annioversary line Zelda amiibo eventually, and the 3 they found data for are for the links of those 2 games and TP Link"
21419,"Good job ignoring the entire rest of the conversation.    
I bet you just can't wait until amiibo have entire dungeons locked behind them huh ?    
obviously it is all ok cause ""that dungeon wouldn't have been in the game otherwise anyway hurrdurr""  

Also, that doesn't make sense, she is summoned with the SSB Link amiibo, not the OoT Link.  
SSB Link gives the Twilight Princess tunic, so that epona is obviously based on the TP one.  

Which BTW looks the same as the OoT one and any other epona.  
the only actual difference between the eponas is artstyle and age.  


"
22168,"Nice try using that picture from the announcement trailer instead of from the Epona in the actual game.  

[This](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda/images/0/04/Epona_(Twilight_Princess).png/revision/latest?cb=20111013022839) is the actual TP epona.  
and like I said : Artstyle difference is all that is.  

But again, good job just ignoring everything of relevance in this discussion in favor of crying about which Epona she most closely resemble.  "
22534,"No, I dislike the fact that they locked actual content behind an amiibo (Wolf Link)  
The Epona thing is stupid to have been locked, but it isn't any sort of issue.   
What I am ""mad"" about is that you aren't even capable of accepting the point of this conversation in favor of crying about on which Epona this is based on.  
Guess what ?  
this Epona's mane is luminescent, Epona from OoT didn't have that, so following your own logic, this is obviously a new Botw-specifc Epona.    

Though you are fucking blind and/or stupid if you think they added Epona out of the ""goodness of their heart"" to an amiibo or whatever bullshit you need to come up with to justify it to yourself and others.  
they added it cause people care about Epona, and there will be people willing to buy an amiibo for it.   
"
23101,"Where does that say it is an actual issue ?  
there is a reason why it is a PS.  
Nothing in that statement is incorrect, Epona is locked behind an amiibo because Nintendo wants your monays.  
"
23239,"There are still several in stores in other regions, my store still has several of the SSB Link which I hear in NA are an issue to find.  
just cause your area doesn't have them doesn't mean none have them.  
also, there will be more anniversary amiibo coming, including one that is based on the same Link as SSB Link.  
"
23499,"Nope, I don't live in the US.  

and don't you worry, I know plenty about selling amiibo on ebay for the right prices."
24019,"Point still remains, they locked the only battle compagnion behind an amiibo.  "
29530,"Definitly, the champions were done absolutely horrible.  
Great designs and concept, absolutely horrendous execution.  

And the trend of making everything ""open world"" and the dick measuring contest of who can make the biggest map is fucking retarded.  

Hyrule could literally be as big as the IRL world and that still wouldn't mean anything if they don't do anything with the areas in it."
34565,"I actually think the characters weren't developped at all, and that that is one of the main issues with the story to begin with.  
"
50374,"&gt; and think it's rather pessimistic for one of the unanimously, highest rated games in history

Letting that change your opinion in anyway is what causes circlejerks and is stupid as shit.  

edit: and I'm ""enjoying"" this game plenty.  
just not as much as a Zelda ought too, but that aint hard when BotW is a sub-par zelda game.  
It is one of the, if not THE, best open worlds games, Just a shame it could be that without cutting out like half of what makes Zelda awesome"
51055,"&gt;
your argument sounds like judging the game by what you want it to be, rather than what it is.  

Yes, cause I WANT it to be fun.  

If the Mario Series would be more fun as a shooter should it just drop all its series' conventions and all that gave it its identity in favor of what is currently the ""in"" genre?  
"
58530,"&gt; and your argument is assuming that a game can only be one or the other. that's part of the genius of nintendo; how they're able to seamlessly combine elements from different genres into one. BotW is an open world game AND a zelda game. One does not cancel out the other.

My argument actually doesn't imply that it can't be both at all, it implies that it failed in combining the two in a way without it losing its series' main identity imo.  

&gt;
But I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your time with the game  

never said that.  
Not once.  

&gt; it has all of the staple conventions of the series, both in cosmetics and mechanics. you clear dungeons, meet Gorons, open chests, fight Bokoblins, get items and upgrades, etc. it's just that the percentage in which you do those things has shifted.  

If Skyrim was re-skinned to have Gorons and bokoblins and have Link as the main character, would it suddenly be a zelda game ?  
I think not, no.  

Breath of the Wild plays like an Open world game (a really good one) with a Zelda skin tacked on.  
Comparable to Starfox adventures except with the base game where the IP was tacked onto actually being good.  



"
60170,You too.  
1039133,"lol  
Yeah right, I love every single Zelda game but now cause I'm not sucking BotW's dick I'm ""not a Zelda fan"" ?  
Makes sense."
1042365,"&gt;
It has flaws but I feel like you went through the game looking for ocarina of time instead of its own game  

I considered OoT the lowest on the list for the 3D games actually, so BotW actually boosted it up to second-lowest.  
And no, i was looking for a Zelda game when I went through, but what BotW is, is an (amazing) open world game with a Zelda skin over it  

&gt;I know because I did the same with the trailer and I was trashing it.  

I was actually very hyped before the game was released, cause I never even considered for a second that they had pretty much already shown everything of note that was in the game in the actual trailers itself.  

&gt; Also you lIke the monstrosity of Phantom Hourglass?  

Yes, PH is an amazing game.  
I think ST did a lot of the stuff PH did first, better, but there are still a handfull of things PH did better.  
For one, the TotOK is mechanically one of the best dungeons in the entire series, and if it had been more interesting/unique visually, I'd just call it top 5 dungeon material for the entire series tbh.  
And PH also has the best itteration of the boomerang, the bombchu and the grabbling hook in the series.  
Linebeck is awesome too
