You can't even buy the SSB Link amiibo in stores anymore. The special rewards for scanning SSB amiibo are clearly a small thanks to the fans who bought them, not locking content to get more money."

Do you think Epona should have been in the base game? It wouldn't make much sense considering she lived ~10,000 years before this game, would it? They clearly just added Epona to be an amiibo reward.

&gt;I'll bet more SSB Link amiibo or ones that register similar to him will pop up eventually.

I doubt it. I've been waiting for a Donkey Kong amiibo restock for almost a year now and it hasn't happened."
21127,"&gt;Epona reincarnates/re-appears just like every other reocurring character in the series

The Epona you summon via amiibo is clearly the one from OoT. The other Eponas look different.

If you want a ""reincarnated"" Epona then just catch a horse and name it Epona. That's the exact same thing."

Why don't you tell me which one of these two Eponas matches BoTW Epona the best?"

Look in the mirror. You're throwing a tantrum because Nintendo didn't include a horse named Epona when you can go catch any horse and name it Epona and it's exactly the same. "

Oh it's not an issue?

23149,"&gt;Nintendo wants your monays

You can't buy the SSB Link amiibo in stores.

You'd think that if Nintendo wanted to get you to buy the SSB Link amiibo so bad, they'd put it in stores to buy, hm?"
23312,"They go for $50 on eBay. If you have them in stores near you I'd suggest that you buy them to flip.

Can you point me to a retailer where you can pick up a new US version SSB Link for retail price?"
23798,Okay?
24105,The reason I haven't been addressing that point is because I agree with you on that.
