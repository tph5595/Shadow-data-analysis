26870,"Read through all your comment chains and I agree with everything. I gave the game every chance (90+ hours play time and did all shrines), and it's probably my least favourite Zelda game. The open world aspect heavily weakened other core Zelda features that should have been present, primarily well thought out dungeons and a good story. I despise the open world trend of video games today, where open world means chasing icons around a map and never actually doing anything of substance, and while BOTW certainly did it better in my eyes, I don't play Zelda to do those things.

Others can argue that if I don't like those things then I can avoid them, and that's fine by me, but this only works if the main content can stand on its own, and I didn't find this to be the case in BOTW.

One final thing I want to point out is how bullshit the marketing was for this game. It showed you all these other characters and major events happening and then you get into the game and find out that those events are locked behind optional memories and those characters are barely even in the game."
