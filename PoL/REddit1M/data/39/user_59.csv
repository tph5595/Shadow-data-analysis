50671,"I mean, I think i can understand why you say that. The game does ""water down"" a lot of conventions that the Zelda series has built up in the last few decades. But it does so by replacing them with mechanics and gameplay that are way more fun.

your argument sounds like judging the game by what you want it to be, rather than what it is."
58290,"that's quite a landslide argument. Breath of The Wild is still a Zelda game. it has all of the staple conventions of the series, both in cosmetics and mechanics. you clear dungeons, meet Gorons, open chests, fight Bokoblins, get items and upgrades, etc. it's just that the percentage in which you do those things has shifted.

and your argument is assuming that a game can only be one or the other. that's part of the genius of nintendo; how they're able to seamlessly combine elements from different genres into one. BotW is an open world game AND a zelda game. One does not cancel out the other.

But I'm sorry you didn't enjoy your time with the game. Give yourself a break for a while, then try playing through it again. I think once you accept what the game is, you might then be able to appreciate it better as a result, because it's pretty amazing.

also Mario Sunshine has shooter elements, as the game revolves around you having a water pistol. Another example of Nintendo blending Genres in imaginative ways."
