48077,"I disagree with a lot of what you said, and think it's rather pessimistic  for one of the unanimously, highest rated games in history, but I do agree with you on one thing.

I really didn't like that there weren't any dungeons. The shrines were AWESOME, but the Beasts just didn't satisfy me. Some of the shrines were almost as difficult as the Beasts. 

I also wish there were more ghosts and spirit items. There didn't really seem to be a ""scary"" realm, although the guardians almost made me poo my pants a few times.

So, I definitely think there was room for improvement, but I also think you've probably enjoyed this game less than the lowest .1% of people. "

What I wish would happen is they give you some clue to a larger puzzle. "
