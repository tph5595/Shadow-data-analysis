What are some of your favorite subreddits to visit outside of r/Zelda?

Do any of y'all like metal music? "
29722,FFXV got reeeeally boring ~16 hours in so I stopped playing. It's a shame since I see a lot of potential in that game. 
29967,"r/gamegrumps! Do you have a favorite playthrough? 

I wouldn't call Blue Oyster Cult metal, and Rush's metal years are kind of the first two albums, but 2112 certainly has some metal aspects. Plus it's a freaking perfect album. 

If you like Rush and want something in the same vein, check out *Operation: Mindcrime* by Queensr√øche. It's definitely its own thing but it borrows a lot from Rush's early years. "
