0,"Hey guys, I'm one of your 14 new moderators! Too many. We're all very *shiny*, *fabulous* and *glorious*! Plus we're new to moderating this subreddit, so if you think we're doing something wrong feel free to tell us. But for fun, the mods and I have decided to do an AMA. We're not worthy of an AMA, but we thought it'd be fun.

So, you're allowed to ask us ***any question that isn't too inappropriate.*** *And yes, even silly questions that aren't related to the subreddit!* 

-----

* The AMA will last until Monday, so don't feel rushed to ask questions.

* We will try to answer every question over time. Don't panic just because your question hasn't been answered in an hour.

* Not every moderator will participate. I won't point out names, but some of us had important things to do and weren't able to make it. Us ~~mods with no lives~~ I mean mods who weren't very busy will answer your questions.

* You have a minimum of only 18273218362131 questions. Use it wisely. But seriously, ask all you want! Just don't spam the same question over and over. That can result in a ban from our lovely subreddit.

-----

That's basically it! Most questions by other moderators will be answered tomorrow!

And for the sake of the AMA, please don't answer questions if you aren't a mod.

EDIT: AMA is finished. Thanks to everyone who participated!"
585,"1. I absolutely love OOT. It may seem unoriginal, but that's the one that struck my heart like the master sword. (Bad pun sorry). I'm looking to play MM but not enough time at the moment.

2. Groose from Skyward Sword. At first he was just a funny jerk, but he had so much character development.

3. I'm not even sure! Don't even remember! But I absolutely love challenging yet creative boss battles. "
633,I'll use my dankness and spicy memes along with bad puns to intoxicate you!
807,"Downside. I don't care too much about spoilers, unless it's a big one."
2381,"I haven't played much suprisingly, even though I am a big zelda fan. I guess I'm not a fan then, but an enthusiast!

"
2413,Scizor. My god he looks cool.
2566,"1. I haven't read many theories in fear of them actually being true, (Some are so good they should honestly be marked with a spoiler tag.)

2. The MM one for Link. I love that transformation even though I can't remember the name. EDIT: Fierce Diety.

3. Idk, I'm not good at thinking on the spot or thinking in general."
2671,1 tingle sized duck. If I was an RPG character I would be a strong but slow character that can't deal with swarms. I would also have lots of defense. *I went off topic*  
3325,I ' M  S O R R Y  I  F O R G O T  P L Z  F O R G I V E
4092,I don't do zelda because for your information because she's a fictional character ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
4229,Idk. *I'm good at questions*
4460,"~~*Fierce Diety. It's not a transformation, it's link's true form!*~~

Bunny hood. 2 Fast 4 me.

"
4512,Videogame along with Electronic.
5182,No where. I'll wander around. Find some glitches and show them here.
12389,"~~Power and authority muahahah~~

Nah but to be serious, I just like helping people. I feel good and the guy that got helped appreciates it. It's a win - win."
52378,"1. Not that hard, you just need to have a clear mind, discipline and knowing how a community would react to things.

2. Sometimes, but not all the time. From this subreddit specifically I've seen none.

3. Nope, I'm very active.

4. Sadly no, but if I do I'll name mine Lonk for fun.

5. Zelda's a guy?!?!?"
52440,"1. I'm surprisingly not that into PS4 and Xbox.

2. /r/ClashRoyale and I absolutely love /r/askreddit.

3. Nah."

2. I'm not even sure. "
53092,Can I have mod?
53108,Oh wait...
142353,"Heh, spot on man. We are getting a CSS makeover in preparation for BotW. Almost the entire mod team is working on ideas for how we would approach it. This might be a little too much information, but even the entire subreddit is getting revamped. If you haven't noticed there are newly worded rules. And if I remove a post, the automated message is different."
142418,"Basically what neo said. I'll personally love it, but some parts of the fan base won't be so open to new ideas."
142446,Still haven't played that game :(
142504,"I don't have a specific favorite, but I do love a good FPS.

"
156105,"Mostly halo and stuff like that, though I haven't played one in quite a while."
