27563,"Rush! My absolute favourite band ever. My all-time favourite song by them is [The Analog Kid](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ubhq2qiUVxY); I also really love La Villa Strangiato, Cold Fire, The Big Money, Middletown Dreams, Cut to the Chase, Presto, Heresy and waaaaaay too many others to name.

Otherwise, I'm into a decent amount of other rock bands though it's still a genre I'm quite new to and still exploring. Been on a lot of Supertramp recently. I also love electronic, especially the heavy stuff!"

Mostly just ones about things I'm interested in, so I lurk a lot on /r/Monstercat and /r/gamegrumps.

I listen to 2112 and Rush's other metal stuff regularly since I listen to Rush regularly and always like a bit of Blue Oyster Cult (that is to say I only really like Don't Fear the Reaper), but that's about as far as I've gone with the genre."

I really love their Wind Waker and Fire Red LPs as well as Ninjabread Man."
