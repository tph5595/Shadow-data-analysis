Sheik/Midna  (can't decide)


I really like fighting dark link (does that count?)
"
1096,I know I'll get it spoiled eventually on the Internet. We're living in the day of age where you can get something spoiled while you're playing Rocket League or reading some youtube comments on a pokemon video. I might as well try my best to make sure other people don't get spoiled on this sub. That's the least I can do. 
1338,Who is your favorite pokemon?
1432,"100 duck-sized Tingles for sure. I love 1, so it'd be cool seeing 100 mini ones. "
3313,I haven't played the DS games and Wind Waker. I don't own a Wii U and I can't find it for cheap for the Gamecube. 
3667,"1. I don't really read theories but I thought it was funny when I heard that Zelda is actually a robot. 

2. Blue!

3. I like the one where Aonuma had a nightmare where Dekus were terrorizing him. "
4559,No way
4742,I'm going to get a shield and then straight to the mountains to sk8. 
4894,It depends on the situation. When doing homework I listen to Zelda music but other then that I have a wide range: from gangsta rap to classic rock. I listen to lots of music but I keep away from heavy metal and trap music (is that what it's called?) . What about you? 
14162,"I'm always on Reddit, might as well help out the communities I like. :)"
20373,"The hardest part about being a mod is finding a good team. Sometimes some mods have massive egos and are control freaks. If you do one thing they don't like they'll jump on your back. This modding team is nothing like that. It's crazy how much we encourage and build off of each other. 

We haven't gotten much angry messages in the few days I've been a mod but I'm looking forward to the release of BotW. 

It isn't hard for me to keep up with new posts. It is harder for me to keep up with comments since I can't go through every thread at all times and read the comments. It's important for you guys to report stuff because we see that right away. 

Do you have a picture of your fish? I don't have any pets named after Zelda characters, but I wouldn't mind calling a future daughter Zelda. I doubt the future wife would even like that lol. 

Zelda is a girl, my dude. "
27342,"I'm a ps4 guy and my favorite game for the ps4 is the Last of Us. However, lately I've been playing the hell out of Rocket League and Battlefield 1 for months (years when it comes to Rocket League) with some FFXV on the side. 

Some of my favorite subs on here are definitely the gaming subs for the games I mentioned along with other game franchises like Pok√©mon and the new Switch sub. But the sub I go on the most is /r/nba. 

I actually don't listen to metal music. "
62180,"My all time favorite is Stone Temple from MM. I also like Zelda's Lullaby (specifically from OoT Skyward Sword and Twilight Princess). 

My favorite character is Agitha from TP. "
95094,"Hello, for me it has to be Red Dead Redemption. It's such a fun game. I'm beyond excited for the sequel and I plan on buying a better TV just for the game."
99112,No problem! Thanks for asking a question. What is your favorite non-zelda game?
153231,Nintendo is one of those developers where you can safely pre-order and not get screwed. I actually think it will be better than I expect it to be  
172761,Yes. Who do you think I am?
192900,Oh no you just had to ask this hard question D:If I have to choose it'll have to be Twilight Princess first. Skyward Sword second. OoT third. I was stuck on this question for a good 10 minutes.
