3212,Umm the duck. Tingle is terrifying.
3322,"Lmao, short story on that. Back when I was young people asked me which Pokémon I played and I told them I played Legend of Zelda. Only kid in my school to play legend of Zelda and not play Pokémon. Never played a Pokémon game other then Pokémon Go and frankly I'd stick to legend of Zelda any day than Pokémon. Favorite Pokémon? Pikachu, cause he was so cute in the Pokémon cartoon."
3363,Are you implying that we're not true Zelda fans? :(
3498,"Twilight Princess

Frankly Idk. Darnuia or any Goron. Love those guys.

Ganondorf in TP. The multiple times you have to face him is so fun."

92269,"Like /u/NeoShader said, we'll probably have to take one for the team. If it comes to one of us getting spoiled vs. you guys I'm sure all of us would rather take it then any of you guys."
92435,"Ha funny enough, I'm more of a PC guy than ps4/xbone. To me the only essential console is a nintendo one. Just add a pc and it's perfect for me at least. 

I usually go onto r/FlashTV, r/Arrow, r/LegendsofTomorrow. (HINT: I love those shows). Sometimes r/TF2 or r/MetalGearSolid.

Nah I don't listen to metal."
92504,To help the Zelda community. I love the Legend of Zelda and Nintendo community and I want to give back to these people who gave me so much!
