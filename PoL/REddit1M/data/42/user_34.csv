Considering Lanayru was a sea at some point before Skyward Sword, is it possible that it went back to being a watery region eventually? Especially considering that Lake Hylia (as far as I recall) does not exist in any form in Skyward Sword, since Lake Floria is now confirmed to be different."

As far as I know, the only evidence for it happening so long ago is the Divine Beasts being named after sages, but couldn't those names be ""modern"" Hylian names for them, named such after they were discovered 100 years ago, instead of the original Sheikah names?"
