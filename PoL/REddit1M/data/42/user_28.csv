52679,It lines up pretty well with Spirit Tracks too
55316,"I thought Windfall Island was placed in a spot near Dragon Roost since Kakariko was near Death Mountain, that Kakariko becomes Windfall and Death Moutain becomes Dragon Roost. After all, Dragon Roost and Death Mountain are both volcanoes and Windfall shares it's music with Kakariko.

Also, the only real similarity between the Adult Timeline and BOTW is that Spirit Track's map is very similar to BOTW. Despite that, the Master Sword is still resting at the bottom of Old Hyrule's Great Sea, so it makes no sense for the Master Sword to suddenly teleport to New Hyrule alongside Ganon. I think the only timeline that truly makes sense is the Downfall Timeline since it ends with death of Gannon in Zelda I (meaning that his spirit is free during Zelda II and beyond) and the geography of Zelda II is large yet mostly unpopulated, similar to BOTW (I feel that the population was still pretty small before Calamity Ganon, just not as small as what we see in BOTW).

There is a lot of room for story in Zelda II's ending. We never specifically hear that the Zoras, Gorons, and Gerudo are extinct, nor do we hear that the Koroks and Rito never came into existence. All we see is the section of Hyrule with Hylians populating most towns, so the rest of the Kingdom is ambiguous. We can see the Zoras slowly evolve into River Zoras throughout the Downfall Timeline, but that doesn't mean that the Sea Zoras went extinct. The Sea Zoras are found in the Oracle games despite being after ALTTP, a game where River Zoras completely took over Hyrule. This could mean that they migrated to other places outside of Hyrule, and potentially returned in BOTW.

I also want to mention that the Deku Tree and Sheikah cannot be used a Timeline evidence since they are missing at the end of all timelines (which doesn't necessarily mean that they don't exist, they are just unmentioned). I dare you to look through Zelda II, FSA, and ST and find the word Sheikah at least once."

It's the same song, man. Windfall Island is a remix of Kakiriko Village (which blew my mind when I first learned that, Wind Waker and A Link to the Past were my first Zelda games).

Zelda I Ganon is dead, which means his spirit is free. Ganon dies in ALTTP, but is resurrected in OOA/OOS, and dies in those games, but is resurrected and killed in ALBW, but is either resurrected or reincarnated in Zelda I and dies, and is almost resurrected in Zelda II. The point of Calamity Ganon is that after coming back to life over and over, his spirit gave up and manifests into it's pure form. In the Child Timeline, Ganon is sealed in OOT, but the seal breaks in TP (a game where he gets killed), and he is reincarnated in FSA. In the Adult Timeline, Ganon's seal breaks in WW, but he gets sealed again (and forever) by the hands of the Master Sword. The only timeline where Ganon NEVER dies is the Adult Timeline, AKA the least likely timeline. Ganon dies the most in the timeline I think is the most likely, AKA the Downfall Timeline. Due to Demise's curse, Ganon's spirit will never die. He will always find a way to be resurrected or reincarnated after death. If he is beaten and he is still alive, then he will be sealed away.

The River Zora situation is complicated. It is never explicitly stated that the Ocean Zoras go extinct. Even in the Adult Timeline, it is only stated that they evolved, but it is never mentioned that they went extinct. Since River Zoras and Ritos are both evolutions of the Ocean Zora, it might be possible that River Zoras are a middle step in the evolution from Zora to Rito. I haven't played much of the Oracle games, but the fact that Ocean Zoras exist in lands outside of Hyrule is evidence that they are capable of migrating. I would have to say that Ocean Zoras must still exist during the time of Zelda I and II, just not in Hyrule.

I guess Impa in Zelda I and II would point to evidence that the Sheikah MIGHT exist in those games, but I personally think that the BOTW Sheikah are a different group than any Sheikah we know about. I believe that the BOTW Sheikah took the name of the original Sheikah because they worked in a similar position to the original (helping and protecting the Royal Family of Hyrule).

Darunia and Saria's descendants being Hylian aren't strong enough evidence of their species being bred out into extinction. With Zelda I and II, the lore of the various races is vague enough for anything to happen with them. Also, the first dungeon of Zelda I is 100% NOT the Deku Tree. It's just an ordinary tree with a face, similar to the one in the upper right corner of the map where the gambling old man plays a money making game with Link."
60101,"Why not? It doesn't mention if the hero succeeded. All it says is that Ruto aided the hero. In the Downfall Timeline, Link is killed in battle, but Ganon is still sealed away by Zelda, thus saving the kingdom. Ruto's efforts were not in vain in the Downfall Timeline, and the Zoras could've lived long enough to remember her sacrifice.

63791,"Demise's curse can't be any of those three, though. Vaati has existed from Minish Cap to FSA, a period of time that includes the birth of OOT Ganondorf, his sealing, his death in TP, and his reincarnation in FSA. Remember, in FSA the final boss wasn't Vaati, it was actually Ganon, the being who stole the Dark Mirror to create Shadow Link in order to awaken Vaati as minion and who stole the Trident in order to transform into the King of Darkness. Those two Ganons were the incarnation that Demise's rage manifested into.

Malladus can't be a part of Demise's curse, either. Malladus as existed either alongside or before Demise, sharing the same title as him (the Demon King). Malladus was the Demon King who attacked New Hyrule before it became known as New Hyrule, while Demise was the Demon King who attacked Hyrule and nearly killed all of the Hylians before Hylia intervened and sealed him away. Malladus was probably even stronger than Demise when he still had his full power. The only forms of Malladus that we've seen are his spirit form, possessed Zelda body form, and possessed chancellor Cole form, with his Cole form being almost as strong as Ganon himself.

Finally, for Bellum, he can't be a part of Demise's curse either. During the time when Bellum arose to become a threat to Link, the current incarnation of Demise's curse (OOT Ganondorf, AKA WW Ganon) was still alive. In WW, Ganon was never killed, only sealed away. This means that Demise's spirit is still attached to Ganon's stone body that is lying at the bottom of the Great Sea.

Majora can't be a part of Demise's curse either since Majora exists in a parallel dimension to Hyrule, existing similarly to Yuga. Both of these beings exist while Ganon is still alive and parallel him, meaning that they are different yet similar.

It's pretty safe to say that Demise's curse is simply an assurance that somewhere, his soul will possess a being named Ganon/Ganondorf in order to cast out his revenge on the descendants of SS Link and SS Zelda (AKA the hero of legend and the goddess blood princess)."
70717,"The games never say that there can be multiple incarnations of Demise's rage. All it says is that ""an incarnation"" will be after the goddess blood princess and the spirit of the hero. AN incarnation, as in one incarnation. One incarnation with a design based on Demise's attributes, such as his red hair, a white scar on the chest (in the case of TP Ganondorf after getting stabbed by the sword of sages), and dark colored skin. As quoted by the character designer of Skyward Sword, Kinouchi, in Hyrule Historia page 17,

""With the only instructions that it should be enormous and that 'it's vulnerability is on it's head,' we were allowed to design the Imprisoned as we pleased. Its design looks more like a kaiju than a monster. Trying to show the impressive presense and the overwhelming power of Demise, we drew him again and again until we got it right. To give him *some resemblance to Ganondorf*, we didn't just make his hair red, but set it on fire. (laughs) His sword looks like a black Master Sword"".

Demise's rage is Ganon, and ONLY Ganon."
142255,"His efforts brought forth the awakening of the six sages, he killed nine large beasts that terrorized the locals, while we was merely nine years old he destroyed the Deku Tree's curse, opened and cleared Dodongo's Cavern, calmed the great water spirit guardian Jabu-Jabu, was worthy of wielding the the bane of evil AKA the Master Sword, his efforts were the catalyst that brought peace to the entire kingdom. He was respected among the Kokiri, the Zora, the Gorons, the Gerudo, and the Hylians as a brave warrior who never gave up. He destroyed the monsters that plagued the forest, he prevented the eruption of the volcanic Death Mountain, he broke the curse that kept Zora's Domain frozen thus allowing it to thaw, he destroyed the shadow that haunted Kakariko's well, he freed Nabooru from grasp of the evil Twinrosa twins, etc.

He isn't a hero because he succeeded. He is a hero because he accomplished so much without expecting a reward or respect. He proved his courage and was chosen by the gods to be worthy of owning the Triforce of Courage, AKA 1/3 of the most powerful relic in the entire series. His ancestors and his descendants all share the spirit and the name of the goddess's chosen hero. He is a hero because he is Link."
