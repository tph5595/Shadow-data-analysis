68860,"I agree. Also, thematically/mechanically the lack of a ""partner,"" e.g. Midna, King of Red Lions, is a Downfall timeline trait. Other ""downfall"" tropes are long sideburns(though seen in WW), Zelda using telepathy, the master sword in a pedestal in the lost woods (though seen in TP), and more open ended gameplay. 


I feel like thematically, in the downfall timeline, Hylia's (the 3 dragons/elder gods) ""long term"" plans have failed, and rather than ""it was foretold that a hero would do ""x"" and journey with partner ""y"" we get Zelda, as the reincarnation (though not aware of that, and with little knowledge of what the triforce actually is, despite being in possession of it in multiple games), having to come up with the plan on her own, and communicate it to link via impa(TLoZ) or through telepathy(LttP, BotW). this is also reinforced with the use of Light Arrows as the final weapon to kill ganon, rather than the gods' preferred method of sealing with the master sword."
