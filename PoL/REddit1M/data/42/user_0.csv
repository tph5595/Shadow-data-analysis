443,"I did some geographic comparisons and the colors represent the same landmarks on both maps.

So in BotW I believe Mount Lanayru used to be Death Mountain (it's simple for them to rename landmarks after environmental changes occur).

Comparing the location of Zora's Domain/River in Twilight Princess with Zora's Domain in BotW, I noticed that Death Mountain was located south of Zora's River. That would put Mount Lanayru in the more logical spot for the original Death Mountain, which cooled over the 10,000+ years since. On top of that, Kakariko Village in BotW is placed a lot closer to Mount Lanayru than Death Mountain. If Kakariko Village never moved, then it only makes sense that Death Mountain cooled and became what is now known as Mount Lanayru."
775,"So next is Snowpeak. A lot of people have jumped that Hebra is Snowpeak. However I think the Gerudo Highlands are more logically connected. Just as in Twilight Princess they are located directly north of the Gerudo desert, and they're connected to the Zora River system at its edge."
1385,"Now Hyrule Field. In BotW that appears to be a part of the northern Zora river system. I believe Hyrule Castle in Twilight Princess was a lot more south. I believe it was either on Whistling Hill or the 'peninsula' surrounded by rivers on three of its sides (where all the Skyloft citizen references are).

It appears the castle was reconstructed where Zora's domain once was and Zora's domain was moved more east-ward. Likely after Ganon was quelled 10,000 years ago, they reconstructed the castle over the site of his seal."
1976,"And finally is the Faron Woods. In Twilight Princess the access to Faron Woods is extremely limited. My guess is that the the river leading to the Spring of Courage in BotW is the entirety of TP's Faron Woods with one exception. That exception is the Temple of Time. In Twilight Princess it was located directly south of Lake Hylia. Now in the picture I've illustrated that the Great Plateau moved to the North-West but it's also possible for Lake Hylia to have moved South-East as it's no longer bordering the Gerudo Desert quite so much as before (though there was a mountain range in between them as there still is now).

Side note: I circled the Kokiri Forest/Lost Woods on the TP map and the probable equivalent location in BotW but it's hard to tell since the Great Deku tree migrated the Lost Woods to the far north for whatever reason."
2255,"Another side note: Gerudo desert didn't really move not much to say about it. I'll try to find more to write about later. I did find the area labeled ""Arbiter's Grounds"" in BotW but it's very lackluster and is basically just the site of a Molduga fight, and lacks much true connection to the TP location. Alternatively, the Yiga Clan hideout is in the same general crevice of land. Further investigation will be conducted."
2743,I'm going to be reposting this after every large heap of research I do to further connect all the geographies to Breath of the Wild (focusing on everything canon to the Child Timeline as I believe BotW is in said timeline). Feel free to point stuff out to me so I can make this analysis more and more accurate (or as accurate as us fans can get).
24622,"I don't know what in-game evidence you speak of. Principally it is very unlikely to be in either of the Adult timelines, and most existing (though loose) evidence points towards child.

Regardless, I make this analysis under that assumption. If I'm wrong then there's no need for you to argue that here, because that's not my point with this post. My point is how the geography has moved assuming that it is in the child timeline."
30066,Nah. There's a shrine quest east of Lurelin village that involves taking photos of shards of what appears to be a small mirror of Twilight.
30980,"The similarities to Wind Waker come solely from the fact that they share Ocarina as an ancestor. Wind Waker's Great Sea was made to line up with Ocarina's map perfectly (for example, Windfall Island is located in the same spot as Hyrule Castle). Also don't forget that we see the land beneath the waves and it's completely different from Ocarina.

Imo Adult holds weakest because of the fact Tetra and Link straight up abandoned Old Hyrule. There's no one left to pass on the blood of the goddess as she was the last member of the royal bloodline.

Fallen Timeline is alright but it doesn't make sense that they'd recover from their downfall to reach the technological peak from 10k years prior to BotW. Remember that Ocarina's kingdom was Hyrule's peak in the Fallen Timeline. As far as I can tell, by Zelda II the kingdom had been reduced to the land that is Akkala in BotW and just couldn't recover.

On top of that, in the Fallen Timeline the other races died out, the Zoras only leaving their evil river zora offshoots, and the Deku Tree was destroyed. By LBW the Kokiri, the Gorons, and (I think) the Sheikah had been bred out, and the Zora were fighting to not go extinct as the River Zora dominated. By the original Zelda, only Hylians remained."
34554,Twilight Princess has a lot of problems. I don't know if HD fixed anything but most of its problems can't be so simply fixed because they're all inherent in the design.
34843,"I did, to keep my analysis altogether because link posts do not let you add text."
34946,"Not true. Link and Zelda are fated to ever be plagued by Demise's hatred, which manifests differently across the ages. In Spirit Tracks Ganondorf had been replaced by Demon King Malladus."
35145,"Written history meaning...?

By principally I mean that Ganon isn't available in either Adult timeline and additionally in the Wind Waker timeline Zelda isn't available to pass on the blood of the goddess because Tetra straight up left."
35524,"I have not done that quest yet. I will cede that argument for now.

I use ""both adult timelines"" to refer to downfall and adult collectively because they both offshoot from the same moment.

I don't see how you've deduced that the Child Timeline does not work, and you've failed to address my point on Ganon's availability."
39880,"Tons of items that are only used once in a single dungeon and once for a single heart piece. That's its main problem. It's a lack of concision.

You also have the problem that it was trying to be Ocarina of Time 2. There's a good and in-depth series of reviews on Youtube for the major 3d titles from Ocarina to Skyward Sword that really chops it up."
40309,"It's possible but there's other reasons, like the placement of Zora's river and the Great Plateau being the castle town from Ocarina. The kingdom was smaller and it makes more sense that it everything would be lumped closer together. Mount Lanayru makes more sense for Ocarina's death mountain as well.

The Lanayru region itself is proof of province renaming. Eldin and Faron have generally remained the same over the ages, but Lanayru moved from being the desert to being around Lake Hylia to being around Zora's domain."
40366,Yeah. It's cuz Link is left handed in Gamecube but the majority of people are right handed for the Wii version.
42401,"They couldn't move the Temple because it was physically built over the only entrance to the Sacred Realm. They would have to move the ground itself because it was built over the Sealed Grounds.

I thought so at first too but there's even the same bridge you sneak over in Ocarina of Time and the East Barrens are in the ideal place to be Hyrule Castle's ruins, on top of Rhoam saying Hyrule was founded at the great Plateau.

The Ranch Ruins appear to merely be a reference at this point. That appeared to be buildings destroyed 100 years ago, especially because wood (which is what is there) would not last over 10,000 years so perfectly without being straight up petrified."
54580,"Personally I like to take the geography as given. 10,000 years is a lot of time and definitely gives us plenty of time for the geography to morph.

I'm looking at Lake Floria in BotW and being South of Mt. Lanayru it could possibly be Zora's domain in Ocarina, which would make sense seeing as Lake Floria in Skyward Sword was the home of the Parella, who are supposedly the ancestors to the Zora (Hyrule Historia implies it where they say they wanted the Zora to be in and were corrected to make a more primitive water race)."
54736,"I think it's fun (thus why I made this post). It gives a neat challenge to follow the world we have been given.

The reality is that Nintendo doesn't actually care that much. They'd rather give us a good game over making sure that every fine detail makes sense, so they take creative liberties and handwave it as ""these are legends"" and ""time changes all"". Most references are likely only going to be just that, references."
54944,There's three Gorons in Wind Waker actually. They're part of a side quest and they all reference each other as separate gorons (and they wear different clothing).
54963,Is this the timeline where Link ejaculated into the primordial ooze?
55056,That's not an error. By the time of Breath of the Wild they reseeded the forest north of the castle. The express purpose of the Koroks evolving from the Kokiri is for mobility of planting trees everywhere.
55190,"That's not true. The seven sages from Ocarina are different from the seven sages from Link to the Past's backstory. The sages in LttP were all Hylian, which is why all the maidens sent to the Dark World were as well."
55330,"There's not necessarily a main timeline, but technically WW's timeline should be the main one. It contains all the events of Ocarina of Time, while the child timeline is a consequence of OoT, rather than a natural flow from it."
55802,"Nah. It's the exact spot of Hyrule Castle in OoT.

Dragon Roost is Death Mountain.

Windfall and Kakariko don't have the same music.

I agree with your statement regarding spirit tracks.

In Zelda I Ganon was dead. The entire premise for the villains in Zelda II was to bring Ganon back to life by sprinkling Link's ashes on Ganon's ashes. In that timeline he is presently deceased and his spirit does not live on because his Ganon form is the spirit.

From what I said to another person before, it is clear to me that they are all extinct (at least in Hyrule) because the Zoras lost out to the evolution of the river Zora. The Zoras are found in Link Between Worlds but aside from their queen they are just intelligent river Zoras. They had already lost out within 6 or so generations.

And they can be. The sages in LBW are descended from OoT's seven sages, with Impa being the Sheikah representative. That's the last time anyone close to Sheikah is known to be alive in that timeline, but as with all the races they bred out, as Saria and Darunia's descendants were Hylian. The Deku Tree on the other hand is known to have been destroyed and hollowed out. It's the first dungeon in Zelda I."
57221,I was fairly certain part of the Downfall timeline was that Ganon killed Link's seven sages so they had to gather a new seven.
61306,"Demise's curse does not guarantee Ganon's existence. Demise's curse is specifically, ""An incarnation of my hatred shall follow your kind for all eternity.""

This is very important. Demise's hatred is not just Ganon. It is also Vaati, Malladus, Bellum etc."
65085,"There can be multiple instances of Demise's hatred.

It's not Demise's spirit. Demise's spirit was trapped in the Master Sword and eroded with time. Demise only passes on his hatred, not his spirit, for his hatred does not die. It need not be a specific person. It will simply always live on. Sometimes it lives as ""Ganon"", but other times it exists as other things.

Majora does not exist in a parallel dimension. Majora started in Hyrule and went into Termina. It's implied the Happy Mask Salesman and Majora were demons under Demise. Majora was not an incarnation of his hatred."
79255,"Nope. Hyrule Historia debunks that. In Skyward Sword Lanayru is the desert. Hyrule Historia says that the landscape didn't change much by OoT, where the desert was then named the Gerudo Desert. In Twilight Princess the Gerudo Desert still existed, but Lanayru province had been shifted east-ward, and then Breath of the Wild the Gerudo Desert also exists (regardless of timeline, it is still after Ocarina), but Lanayru is now in the far-east."
79345,"Yes and Link Between Worlds, which is about 6 generations after Link to the Past, there is the Zora Queen but her subjects are mostly River Zora by that point, despite the fact that she is a descendant of Ruto."
79506,"Because 10,000 years ago they fought Calamity Ganon with their technology, and Ganon was not a threat until after Ocarina of Time."
86597,"It's excessive to the norm because most gaps were closer to 100 years each (I think Skyward's gap to its past is several hundred years) and that leaves them a gap of 10,000 years to fill with villains who are not Ganon."
110951,Uh no. They have said for years they care.
