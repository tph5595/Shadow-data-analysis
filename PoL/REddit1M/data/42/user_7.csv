There's pretty much zero evidence to support Child timeline outside of a throwaway line from Zelda, which is too easily handwaved as nothing more than a reference in a game full of references. 

In my opinion, having done quite a bit of looking into it, Fallen timeline holds strongest, followed by Adult, followed by Child. "

Gorons and Sea Zora's didn't die out, they just died out in Hyrule. Just like Gorons left Hyrule when the Great Sea collapsed, but still visit as merchants. Migration is possible, in any timeline. That's why Child is the weakest. It has the fewest possible proofs."
