Twilight Princess is a more traditional Zelda game. This means that it's very linear-there's a set order in which you do each dungeon. Each dungeon has its own special item that is used almost exclusively in that dungeon and then never again. I love the story and the characters, and the individual dungeons are huge and varied and really cool. I think you get a lot fewer hours of playtime though.

Breath of the Wild is all about exploring the open world. The art is less realistic but is gorgeous and will age really well. You don't really have big ""dungeons"" that you are supposed to solve in a set order (there really isn't much of a set order at all). In fact, you spend very little time inside, it's much more about landscapes. There are tons of small puzzles to figure out and 4 bigger ones. Combat is a lot more interesting, and you use every item a lot. I think it will have a lot of replay value just because of how big the open world is and how fun it is to wander around in.

If you haven't played a Zelda game before, I think I'd recommend Breath of the Wild. It's sort of a combination of assasin's creed and dark souls, but with the landscape-type focus of Skyrim. Twilight Princess is harder to think of a comparison for."
