33319,"Since you have played both games, can I ask you something?

I have the Nintendo Wii U.
I want to play breath of the wild but it costs the double than the twilight game. 

Should I save and get breath of the wild or is it fine to get only the twilight game?

I have never played a Zelda game before."
