I get not liking sailing, but that was so relaxing. The score while sailing was beautiful, until you ran into an Giant Octorok and then shit got real. 

As for MM being last, I mean, it's number 5 of my favorite Zelda games of all time. Like I absolutely loved TMC, OoA, LA, LoZ, and ALBW but their not in my Top 5. But I agree, the mechanics and overall tone of the game might have been amazing for us, but a newer player might not have the best experience with it. "
