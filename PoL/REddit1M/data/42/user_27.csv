The ball and chain was also not necessary widely outside of its own dungeon, but it could also be used as an effective weapon in certain scenarios, so that didn't bother me as much."

Screw that game entirely) but I will never play WW again because I spent entirely too much time sailing. Wasted time doing nothing. Hours. Sailing. Not fighting, or solving puzzles, sailing. With nothing around. No enemies. No changing landscape. Just water. Boring as fuck."

I've heard that here before, but I still have no ambition to ever see that game again in my life. It soured me forever on that first play through.

I actually thought about playing it through again after I beat it when I found out that it's ""different"" after you beat it. But when I realized the difference is that you play in your pajamas I literally said ""Aw, fuck that!"" and turned it off."
