48425,"I think you may be underestimating the degree to which we have to take in-game abstraction into account. Breath of the Wild's Hyrule is much *bigger* than any previous Hyrule, which necessarily means that features we haven't seen before are going to become more visible, simply because the game has ""zoomed in"", so to speak.

I'd also point out that Death Mountain being south/east of Zora's River in TP was an anomaly - in every other game where both features appear, Death Mountain is north/west of Zora's River."
