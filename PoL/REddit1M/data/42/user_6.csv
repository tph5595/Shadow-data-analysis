28190,"There has been nothing that has been said that has ruled out the Child and Adult timelines. I dont know where youre saying what in game evidence says that. If anything, the Downfall timeline is the one that makes the least amount of sense."
28289,"I agree with you. Right now, based on current evidence, it seems to be the Child Timeline. I do think its worth noting that we shouldnt rule out the Adult timeline as the curse is inevitable, so Link, Zelda, and Ganon are bound to fight again after the events of Spirit Tracks."
28352,"With that logic, the same reason that Koroks and Rito's exist dont prove that its the Adult timeline either."
28659,"Based on what people are saying...Im really convinced that its a convergence. I want to say I have heard before that, no matter how far off you get from a timeline, based on current theories about time, timelines will eventually converge back to the main one.

Based on evidence in game, I could see this being the convergence event."
29174,"Personally, I would love if its in the Child Timeline (as that is the main timeline) but, I could see it being a convergence because there are too many similarities, subtle hints, and assumptions that leads me to believe its all three.  The only thing I feel like, if it is, the Adult timeline would need to be elaborated on to reintroduce the curse and such at some point."
35860,"You misunderstood what I said. If BotW is canon to the Adult Timeline, it means someone would have had to have found Ganon to release him from his seal, thus also getting the Master Sword."
55953,"Actually, it depends on what you emphasize. Ill take back my comment about it being the main timeline because you can easily make a case about why each one is the 'main' timelnie."
