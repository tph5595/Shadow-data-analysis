28050,Principally you say... So we're just straight up ignoring written history because there's a vague legend about a legendary sword. Ok...
35328,"Zora monuments.

WW *is* adult timeline so I'm not sure what you mean by additionally to. By simple deduction we can eliminate both adult and child timelines, leaving us with downfall"
38034,"The timeline splits into downfall when Link is struck down during the fight at the top of the tower. Up till that point, Link was still the Hero, awakening the sages. The monument never said he dealt the final blow, something I think was deliberately left out to allude to downfall *and* adult as Ruto the Sage exists in both of those timelines. "
45369,"Regardless of the outcome, Link was still considered the Hero incarnate. Regarding the sages, it was very important in the downfall timeline that he had awakened them as they were responsible for sealing Demon King Ganon in the Sacred Realm at the end of the imprisoning war. Which starts off the timeline. "

Past Links are referred to as ""The Hero"" because narratively his name is lost to time. The Hero that Ruto's monument refers to is The Hero of Time. He doesn't have to be a hero in your head, but he's still called a hero. "

The sages all being of Hylian descent was retconned following the release OoT, which was confirmed by developers interviewed during the release of OoT. Hyrule Historia later doubly confirmed this by explaining the Imprisoning war was a direct result of Link being killed by Ganondorf.

Did you not just call him a hero despite his failure?"
