Also! The translation varied by region. "
25715,"The Japanese version doesn't mention Twilight. 

It's Nintendo purposely mudding up the water. "
28554,Exactly! As time (x) approaches infinity in any timeline x1=x2=x3

But a non-timeline... love it! "
29465,"The adult timeline is truly a dead end. Beyond Wind Waker you have a new Hyrule. It's like what made Skyward Sword a black sheep, it's not standard hyrule. 

I'd be satisfied if Nintendo said child timeline.  It's not a bad theory, just a debatable one. "
