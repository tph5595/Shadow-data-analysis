39529,"Start with OOT, its the best IMO.  You can get it on the Wii U eshop, or better yet on 3ds if you have one.  To me, the most worth playing are, in this order 

1. Ocarina of Time
2. Majora's Mask
3. Twilight Princess
4. A Link To The Past (if you are ok with older graphics, it holds up surprisingly well for a super nintendo game.  You can get it on the eshop.)
5. Wind Waker"
39746,"Don't you think it's more likely that Kakariko Villiage would have moved as opposed to Death Mountain being moved or renamed?  I mean, Kakariko Village already moved in A Link To The Past."
41119,"I see.  I have a reason for believing that the Castle in BOTW is in the same place as it was in OOT, however, as opposed to the plateau being the original location.  I'm guessing you've been to the ranch ruins?  Not only is its layout exactly the same as Lon Lon Ranch in OOT, but it's located in exactly the same spot in relation to Hyrule Castle, the Desert, and a few other landmarks.  So, if Hyrule Castle is in the same spot as before, that begs the question of why the Temple of Time is in a completely different area (The Great Plateau).  I have a theory on that.  In short, it isn't the first time we've seen the Temple of Time relocated.  It was also in a completely different place in Twilight Princess (The Lost Woods).  I feel that after OOT, Zelda, the Sages, or someone else used magic to relocate the Temple if Time periodically throughout the ages to make it harder to find for Ganon and those like him.  I mean, we've seen Midna teleport entire structures so its possible.   This time around the Temple was teleported to the Great Plateau, along with a small portion of Castle Town (oops!) apparently leaving behind the pedastal of time with the Master Sword (oops again)."
41305,"Thanks, just curious, which order would you go with?"
42825,"Good point about the 10,000 years thing.  I guess after that much time no wood building could survive.  I guess we can assume that descendants of Malon in more recent times one day decided to rebuild the Ranch exactly as it was back in OOT.

edit: Trying to make sense of Hyrule geography in general gives me a headache."
43246,"Also a good list.  I can see ALTTP as number one since it's what set the stage for Zelda games as we know them.  The reason WW was last on my list was because a. I didn't like the ending (this was my biggest gripe). b. I didn't care for the art (yeah, yeah, I know, but it was a more minor issue for me) and c. I wasn't a big fan of sailing.  However, the gameplay was simply to good for me to ignore it, so objectively I still feel it deserves a place in my top 5.  Even though MM was my second favorite, it's definitely an acquired taste and might turn off a first time Zelda player, so I see why you ranked it last."
56086,"Yeah I can see that, I'd rather have a great game with some familiar landmarks than have them be a slave to detail in that way.  Anytime I play a new Zelda game it's fun to explore and compare it to previous verisons of Hyrule.  Also, like you said 10,000 years is a long time so natural erosion is gonna probably shift things around a bit too."
56204,"Haha same for me on Zelda 2, like you I've also completed every console Zelda game except for Zelda 2. I felt was just a waste of time and energy for me with little to no payoff.  Have you played Wind Waker HD? Sailing is still a chore but made much more bearable with the Swift Sail."
