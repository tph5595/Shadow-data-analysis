34952,"Think of the Zelda games as an anthology. They are not direct sequels but the same idea played out with certain constants and variables. That said which game to play is more of a question of what you are looking for.  If you are looking for a tight narrative with branching side quests but an ultimately straightforward progression, then consider Twilight Princess(or Wind Wakes HD imo the superio game). If you like a more open nonlinear game that neither hand holds nor spits garbage conent at you consider Breath of the Wild
