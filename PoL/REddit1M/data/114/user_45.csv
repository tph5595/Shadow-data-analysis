33533,"How do you get the extravagant bridle?

I found the NPC that gives you the saddle and he gave me 2 times (1:30 and 1:15), I did it under 1:13 and I got the Saddle but not the briddle.. do I have to beat my own record now? or just do anything between the times he gave me?

edit: I did it under 1:21 and he gave me the bridle"
