6634,Not really but it goes away as you continue the story.
6813,Just got a Savage lynel sword with +41 (91 total) attack. I really want an a guardian battleaxe++ with similar stats to use with +3 attack buff and ancient set. That's the highest DPS as far I know.
6919,They're always there. They usually spawn in the same locations. Just keep a spear or sword on you at all times. Then run and smash their faces.
14844,Not really sure why they didn't go away then. They went away for me once I beat the dungeon. I know I hadn't done any shrines or too many quest in the area either because I had to do them all later to unlock something else. 
92386,Anyone know where I can listen to warbler's nest song again? Maybe a video with the song. I completed the quest and I really enjoyed the song.
