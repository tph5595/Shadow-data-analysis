40954,"I'm not sure where I'm supposed to be headed. So far I've enjoyed roaming around the map, to some places I'm definitely not properly equipped for! I have five hearts now. (just did the eventide island with four hearts, what a pain that was!).

I just did a shrine way above that island, which was a 'challenge of medium difficulty', and beat the guardian. That was tough! I think I need to get more hearts from easier shrines...but I feel like I've found all the easy ones."
42236,"Thanks! It took me about seven tries to be fair! I realized I could just batter that huge monster with a metal block I found on the beach. The worst part was the ball on the top of the mountain. There was a huge moblin there that could one shot kill me.

Thanks for the tip. The only mission I have going on there is the photo memories, of which I have found three. I assume I'll find the rest as I progress with the main game. 

Can I go and try a beast with just five hearts do you think?"
63264,"Awesome, thanks. I went back to that village and traded a stamina in for an extra heart.

Well, I went in search of a beast. Went to the waymarker north east. But the cliffs are too high! I went all the way round the back, and then up the back of the mountain. Ended up in a place with flying guardians. Scary!

Managed to scale the Akkala tower there. Realized I'm in the wrong place completely. I love that you can just wander off and get lost on this game. Might be the best game I've ever played."
