49845,"As of 8pm April 4th, I consider myself done with the game-done with as much as I want to get. I don't want to get all the Korok seeds, I only have 5 quests left, got most of the outfits outside of Amiibos, maxed out my hearts and stamina, fought Ganon three times...what do I do now? :(


*Hey, just realized that I played the game for a solid straight month and I am very happy with it!*"
