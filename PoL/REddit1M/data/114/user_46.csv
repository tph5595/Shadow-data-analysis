36919,"I've seen screenshots of a girl who appears to be part of the [Yiga Clan? Or maybe a Shiekah? She's got white hair and a Shiekah symbol on her forehead or somewhere on the front of her body](/spoiler)

I'd rather not know specifics, but which area can I find her in? I'd love an answer that's a little more refined than which region, but a little less specific than saying ""Oh she's right next to xx monument"" or something like that. 

Thanks in advance!"

Wow, I must have completely missed her, I've defeated the Divine Beasts and everything :P"
