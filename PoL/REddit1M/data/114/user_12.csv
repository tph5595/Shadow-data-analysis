9105,Is there an easy way to farm bokoblin guts? I need some to upgrade my Hylian armor and I'm not getting any dropped from killing bokoblins. Just a lot of fangs and stuff. I'm getting frustrated.

12296,"I did that, but they only had 3. I need like 45? I think it's 15 per item to upgrade. "
14675,Need to find more silver ones. I don't see them very often.
16272,"I've done all 4, which is why I'm surprised I'm not seeing more. I thought the tougher enemies spawned the more enemy camps you cleared out. I cleared out a ton of camps early on because I was all about collecting that booty. 

I believe I had a bunch of guts at one point, but I traded a bunch of them into Kilton. I hadn't seen any difference in elixirs using one monster part over another, so I kept my cheaper parts for elixirs and traded him the ones with higher mon value. "
18043,"They only have 3 every blood moon cycle. It'll take me a while to get to 45 that way. I still bought them, but I definitely need to earn some through drops."
