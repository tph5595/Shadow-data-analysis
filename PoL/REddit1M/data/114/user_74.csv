Any idea?"
92879,That being said. is there a reason that shows are permanently sold out of all arrows? I used to buy them and after a while they would restock. Many red moons passed and no shop have arrows anymore. its frustrating.
97524,So im huessing they never restock after a while?
108140,"They don't anymore. I sold out the arrows and hearty truffles at hateno all the time I went. Still no bomb arrow (they stopped restocking those way faster than normal arrows), no arrow. but hearty truffles keep coming back. add about 40 hours of gameplay later, truffles are still coming back, no arrows."
108813,I pretty much did at some point I had to do an update which restarted my switch. plus the SD card update. I will force it again. but im sure it will not change it. Must be a design choice. but I cannot have any world boss respawn even after blood moons.. this is killing me.
171353,Oh. My. Fuck.
177720,Funny last blood moon went to see if a black hinox respawned and it did. First ones i killed did not.
