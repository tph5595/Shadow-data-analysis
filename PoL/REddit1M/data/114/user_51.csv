If you go to the leftmost pause screen (not the weapons; push L or ZL), you can see your active quests. Push A on a quest to show the destination as a special pin on your map. (For quests whose purpose is to find something without being told where it is, the pin shows the person who gave you the quest.)

All the Main Quest subquests should pin exactly where to go, except the one about restoring memories."

If you find yourself low on health, there's a cheap way to convert Heart Containers into Stamina Vessels and vice versa in a certain village that, if I'm inferring correctly from your ""Only have memory, beast, and Ganon Main Quest tasks incomplete"" implication, you have already been to."
