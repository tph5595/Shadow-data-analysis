23634,"How do you guys generally enjoy doing quests ?
Are you planning on doing all the side/shrine quests and talk to all npcs ?
And what if I encounter quest that I just can't find the location for ? or having trouble finding my goal ? Any tips on keeping track of it and generally stay ""productive"" in the game ?

How much should I focus on main quests ?"

 like switching the control buttons(switch jump button option) or turning on this ""pro hud' ? or are default ones good enough ?


It seems like I just can't get used to the default controls"
