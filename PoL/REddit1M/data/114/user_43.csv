33633,"Sometimes for me, I just love exploring the beautiful world. I don't really think about shrines until I come across one in which I do the puzzle. BUT what I found was a priority when I started was getting all the towers, so I can have a full view of the map. When I play, I play as the perspective of the main character, example (may be weird but here it goes), Link wants to go save the princess and Hyrule from Gabon, therefore so do I. Taking on this mindset allowed me to complete the game. Although side quests are what they are, optional, even though I haven't done them, it's completely up to you to do them, you may find some benefits in doing so, whether you gain more knowledge of the game, more gear for link, or even for precious arrows. There really shouldn't be a quest with no location (none that I've come across of) but if you get stuck then come back here and ask about the quest and someone will help or if you're really stuck, give the quest a search on youtube and you'll find a play through of how to complete it. I reccomend to keep trying in your own and not use a guide, but I stumbled through shrines in which I needed help completing through the use of internet. Hope I helped out with your questions dude! Enjoy the game!"
