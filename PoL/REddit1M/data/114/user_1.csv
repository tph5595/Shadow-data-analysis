5001,"Is there a way to effectively navigate through a sandstorm? I don't need anybody to tell me how to do/get it if there is. I would just like to know if there's a more effective way than ""walk in this direction and don't stray off-course."""
14104,How deep into the story? I've taken back three Divine Beast (including Vah Naboris) and still get lost in sand storms in very specific areas of the map. Looking at the map prior to heading into it and sticking to one direction is how I've managed my exploration thus far. 
14195,I get them from Silver Bokoblins almost every time. Almost never from the other colors.
14256,Daruk's Protection (AKA a free shield). Check the last page of your inventory screen for more details.
16050,How many Divine Beasts have you liberated? I've done 3 and there's a White one at 80% of their encampments.
17297,Sometimes feels like it recharges fast (when you're exploring) and sometimes feels like it takes forever (when you're in a dungeon or dangerous area).
18636,This is helpful! Thank you
25264,That disappointed me so much when I finally decided to visit them.
