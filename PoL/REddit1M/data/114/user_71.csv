76599,"That's my main issue with shrines tbh. I like the puzzles and everything, but right now I got to the point where I know that any interesting thing I see on the map, I know I'll get a shrine as a reward, so I tend to get less interested by this. 

If at least the shrines you find after longer quests had interesting items, that would be acceptable, but finding that super interesting place on the map, browse it, figure out what's the secret of it, to then get a shrine with an ancient core inside is a letdown. "
77003,"&gt; There was a long time in the game where I thought I must be somewhere I'm not supposed to be yet, but really the game is just hard

This is so on point! Literally sums up my first, like, 20-30 hours. I avoided as many fights as I could. Monster Den? NO WAY. Sleeping Hinox? NOPE. Lynel? FUCK NO. The few times I tried I got one-shot by random enemies, so I put markers on the map to find these places back when I get stronger

Then I got stronger and enemies would still one (or two)-shot me, and I realized that... I just had to get better lol. One of the reason why I love the game!"
