21542,"I agree with you completely. I am female and I have daughters. I can't stand games in which every female character is half naked and over-sexualized, particularly when they are supposed to be strong and prepared for battle, next to men in full suits of armor. So many games make me feel like the female characters were added solely for male players to ogle and very little, if any, consideration is given to actual females that might want to play and see some strong females in their games. But this isn't that. This is *one character*, in a game that we know has at least one other female that, so far, absolutely does look pretty badass. I was surprised to see the boobies in a Zelda game, but I don't see a problem with them."
