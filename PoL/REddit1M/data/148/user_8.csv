8997,"Jesus the [ghost](http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/zelda/gallery/gal_27.jpg) looks incredible!!. Also I don't mind Shia, yeah she is half naked, but I can see it fitting the theme. both bad guys have this renaissance era party/ evil carnival look to them. At least they made Impa battle ready and looking bad ass with that Cloud sword. "
9895,"I say it's more like 55% naked, but I mean it's about the same % revealing as the Great Fairy, or Nabooru. Plus it's only one character, they made Impa look really bad ass and super battle ready, so I don't think they are degrading women by making 1 over sexualised character, maybe if they did that to all of them then I would be just as upset. But since it's only one character I think it's more of the character trait than anything."
11036,"&gt; If you showed someone a Zelda character, they could probably identify it. I wouldn't have though she was a Zelda character if I was just shown a picture of her with no context.

A valid point, but I feel that's going to the the case with this game in general since it is not a main part of the franchise, it's a branch made by another company all together, so it's with no surprise identifying characters is going to be hard. I mean if Impa did not have the Sheikah eye symbol on her breastplate it would be hard to instantly point her out with LoZ."
18990,oh yeah look at that didn't even notice. Would be funny if she had a second phase were she turns into a giant animal thing.

And about the surprised about the boobies thing, really?  I actually made a post yesterday showing a list of female characters in this category
