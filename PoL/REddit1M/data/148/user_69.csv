Look back at old Disney movies, the male villains are flamboyant and effeminate, the female villains are sexualised. They're often ugly or otherwise undesirable too, but there's a strong history of female villains being sexual.
It also means that her motivations are about another character, a man. She isn't operating on a desire of self, but a desire for another. Which is another thing female characters have historically had to have, a link to or dependence on a male character to justify them. It takes away character and agency.
Outside of the damaging nature of it, it's also just kind of boring and overplayed."
