26426,"If 8 bit sprites don't get you rock hard every time, you have problems."
26527,Did you forget her mask?
27131,"I think it looks pretty cool, not familiar with either of those franchises though."
27552,"I'm unfamiliar with their work, but surely if Nintendo works with them then the final say on what goes is Nintendo's; we'll see though. 

Fantasy is hardly a genre known for creativity, and Zelda plot lines are far from it as well."
28102,"I guess I don't have a problem with it, it looks pretty neat to me. Hard to argue creativity or originality in my opinion."
47548,Did I say that?
63465,"I meant exactly what I said, with sarcasm; that a green tunic isn't a unique/original design. I didn't imply anything about any other aspect of the game on purpose.

The Zelda games *do* borrow from a lot; the castle is essentially just Generic Fantasy Castle #3939 (which started with Disney to my knowledge; this makes sense though, as Disney animation is what jump started the animation industry in Japan after the success of Snow White, so Disney-esque castle? Totally understandable).

Obviously the tri-force itself is a pretty uninspired *design*, same goes for a lot in it; the same goes for Tolkein's work. Chances are that Zelda is like Tolkein in that both started a great deal of things that are now generic, making them feel more generic.

I will say that for all the creativity in a great deal of the stuff in Zelda, though - the bosses, the lore, etc. - the creativity stops within the series itself, and a lot of it is just kind of generic rubber forehead; oh, we have the FISH PEOPLE and the ROCK PEOPLE and the PEOPLE WITH POINTY EARS and the DESERT PEOPLE. 

The stylistic stuff is the biggest part of Zelda's creativity in my opinion. I'd never say the games *aren't* creative and in many, many regards original. But in a lot of ways they're kind of just... expected. There's a lot of obvious inspiration, and that hardly takes out the creativity - *nothing* is completely uninspired.

I guess what I'm saying is, it's as creative as Tolkein was in that it has some clear inspiration from various things that aren't itself, and then adds some twists onto them that make it fresher. That's how most creative things are though; everything's been done in some form or another, but you can just find new ways to do the mermaid (bipedal like the Zora instead of aquatic) and the golem (the Goron) that feels unique again.

I didn't expect a comment that was entirely specific and only talking about the topic in it (The tunic) to make me look like I'm extending that judgment to the entire series."
