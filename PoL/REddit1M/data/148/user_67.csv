63842,"A)Telma is a somewhat unattractive woman, too. Either way, it's not like she has a chestplate designed around showing off her boobs. She just has a low cut top. The Great Fairies are centered around it, but much more tastefully. They're naked because they're fairies and they're one with the Earth. It's not incredibly unusual. Once again, they don't wear something centered on their sexuality. Minda's human form was meant to be sexy, but it wasn't so over the top that it makes you do a double take. It was done in a tasteful way: she was naked to begin with, she's naked now, she has patterns all over her body.

B) I agree. 

C) See point a. Also, of course we have no context to her character. But with what we have now, this is notably out of place. Either way, there's no context I could imagine that would justify that design. All of the other character mentioned are either just naked because their a part of their character or just wearing normal clothes that happen to show off cleavage. Why would anybody make a chestplate like that?

I'd just like to link [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/267du7/zelda_hyrule_warriors_game_official_screenshot/chohyv5) comment from the /r/games thread that's much more articulate than mine as to why this feels out of place. "
64531,"Each of these character's has a context that justifies their outfits or lack therof(with the exception of Veran, who I've always thought looked tacky). And I have the same problem here as I do with Veran: it just looks tacky incredibly out of place. That's where most of these reactions are coming from."
64574,That few people have seen.
130825,She's not really sexualized.
