You got your Juri Han in my Zelda guys, and I am dissapoint.

Rest of the game looks good though"
10286,"I don't mind the Great Fairy or Nabooru because they had reasonably sized breasts. She has two firm watermelons on her chest. I really don't think she degrades women or any of that angry hyper-feminist bs, but it's just tacky character design that I've seen before. Zelda games have their own unique designs. If you someone a Zelda character, they could probably identify it. I wouldn't have thought she was a Zelda character if I was just shown a picture of her with no context. "
22366,"Veran was an 8 bit sprite, as far as sexualized as she could be"
22458,"Well, they were also more covered up. And those aren't even physically possible, they're like, cartoon boobs"
45583,Not true. This looks like a crappy weaboo fantasy MMO
46312,"You're incredibly stupid if you think that Zelda games are similar to the boring ass tropes pulled straight out of J.R.R. Tolkien's tired gray asshole that saturate the rest of fantasy games.

48179,"You're implying that Zelda has no overarching, recognizable styles, and that it isn't original.

Or maybe you weren't being sarcastic at all... hard to tell"
51878,Thanks for confirming that you're a tumblr tier meme spouting idiot 
53985,"Once again, don't care about the sexualization. I'm fine with things like Zero Suit Samus. Just tacky character design that's beneath Zelda games is what bothers me"
57181,"They weren't explicitly fanservice-y or in bad taste?

OoT and MM Great Fairies were hilarious harlequins with too much make up and sharp, polygonal tits. Link actually has a scared reaction to them for comedic effect

TP Great Fairy is au naturale, doesn't have huge tits, they are covered more than a bra would cover them by her hair, and she isn't sexualized. It's to emphasize her purity and not being a part of human society, being part of nature instead

Midna was not topless. She either has no parts worth covering up, or has a skintight suit over her

Same with Ruto, no nipples

Twinrova I'll give you, but Veran was an 8 bit sprite for the game she was in"
