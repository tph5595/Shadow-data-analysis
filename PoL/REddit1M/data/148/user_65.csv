56086,"OoT/MM Great Fairies wore absolutely nothing but extremely tiny leaves, and were pretty much straight naked for all intents and purposes.

TP Great Fairy and Midna were topless. 

Ruto was entirely naked.

Twinrova and Veran weren't exactly the most modest when it came to clothing either.

I understand why it might be a bit strange considering the high quality graphics, but this is *nothing* new to the Zelda series. I fail to find Shia any different than the others."
130662,"TP Great Fairy...okay, I can get behind that one. It does make a lot of sense the way you explain it.

Midna and Ruto didn't have visible nipples, no, but they had very obvious breasts, just like the new villain. It's not like Shia has anything visible either.

Veran does have official artwork, and we're given a very clear picture of what she looks like.

Look, we could go around talking about video game tits all day, but I feel we've both gotten away from the point.

I'll give it to you that she is definitely sexualized, there is no doubt about that, but she's not sexualized because the art style is specifically like that, she's sexualized because her character is supposed to be a very devious, mysterious, and seductive character. Impa isn't sexualized at all. 

It's not like it's entirely for the sole purpose of ""Look, boobs!"" is what I'm trying to say. "
