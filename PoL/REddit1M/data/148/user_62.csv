51133,"That's basically skimming over the fact that *none* of them, except *maybe* Veran, reached this level of sexualization and design for the purpose of pure titillation. Yes, sometimes there are women who are meant to be sexy or physically attractive but a) their designs are not centered around that fact b) most of their designs are pretty interesting and c) none of them are this flagrantly sexualized."
55906,"Once again, I'll point out that you skim over the issue of how much more sexualized they are. I didn't say they don't have sexual qualities. 

A:

On Telma: I disagree. Her body is thick and matronly, her character in the game, while flirtatious, takes on a matron role as well. She's older, her facial features aren't conventionally attractive. Do you really think Nintendo designed her with thinking 'I hope all the 10-12 year olds find this 50-year-old woman sexy!'?

The Great Fairies: More so than most characters, yes. Especially TP's Great Fairy. But even then, their design is meant to invoke nature spirits, and I don't think it was really about titillation--for one, take in mind their shrieking laughter and faces, and compare them to women that *are* supposed to be attractive in the same game: Zelda and Malon, for instance. 

Midna: Striking and beautiful, I can certainly agree with. But titillating? Was she designed for your eye to be drawn to her cleavage, lovingly rendered? Her face has as much unique design as her body does. 

B: Well, that's pretty subjective. The reasons I don't find it interesting is because it looks like it could have come out of any stock evil witch in a Japanese RPG. I kind of like the Venetian thing they seem to be emphasizing (not really for a Zelda game, but as a general idea for a dark mage), but I just think it really lacks. I mean, I've looked at the character many times now, and I don't really remember much about her design... a lot of it because actual design elements are sacrificed in favor of skin and titillation.

C) I don't agree. Telma and Midna have a lot of character in their design. Neither seems really stock to me. Same with Twinrova or Nabooru. Basically, if you asked me to design 'sexy dark witch', I could probably cobble something together that would look similar enough to Shia that they wouldn't look out of place in the same universe. But I don't think 'dark alien princess' or 'matronly adventurer' or 'fire and ice witch' would end up looking like Midna, Telma, or Twinrova. 

This is not to say that Zelda is without fault in design. I do actually think the Great Fairies are kind of boring (save the WW fairies). 

But Shia is generic, and she's supposed to be the main villain. The only reason for settling on a design like that is *absolutely* about titillation."
60563,"That's pretty reasonable, I think. From my point of view, I'm very aware of a couple of things:

1. Team Ninja's involvement. Because of their use of other IPs in past titles, this makes me extra cautious about this one. Over-sexualization for sexiness' sake is a hallmark of theirs, and I'm afraid of it creeping into this game.
2. Female design in video games to begin with. While it's true that context sometimes makes it justifiable (Morrigan from Dragon Age and Lulu from FFX spring to mind), traditionally women in video games are designed to look sexy for a male audience above anything else. This is also a context that's important to keep in mind.
3. Even with context, I don't think you can really excuse this level of blatant pandering in a title with ""Zelda"" in its name, even if it's not directly from Nintendo. They appear to be doing justice to existing characters, though. 

But, you're right. It's generally better to hold off criticisms until something is revealed. For one, they're pretty impotent until you actually know what you're talking about, but also it wastes energy and makes you more likely to predispose yourself to unfair negativity."
