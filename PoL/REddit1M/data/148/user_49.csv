The great fairies in OoT and MM only had some vines covering them- and they didn't change that look with the 3D updated graphics. Telma's breasts were popping through her shirt/jacket and you can clearly see her bra. The great fairies in TP were shirtless, although they weren't very sexualized. Veran and Midna are two others- Midna doesn't wear a top in her humanoid form. The fortune teller in TP is basically wearing little more than a bra, and the canoe girl has a gaping hole in the middle of her shirt between the two little buttons holding it together. The dancers in MM are really only wearing shirts- they're not really long enough to be considered skirts... There's also Twinrova and the Gerudo...

It also isn't exclusive to female characters. A number of shop owners have been shirtless/only wear vests, and the bomb shop guy sure looked like he was down to a vest and a thong... Kamaro definitely has nothing but a thong, Grog is shirtless, etc. 

My point is that a provocatively dressed character and sexualized content really isn't that out of place in this series despite its overall image of being family friendly."
54001,"a) Telma's design is most definitely centered around that- she's also a very flirtatious woman in the game. The Great Fairies are definitely centered around that as well. Midna's humanoid form was absolutely meant to be striking and beautiful/sexy.

b) I'd argue that her design *is* interesting. Not so much the bikini- but I find the mask to be really striking, and the flowing bits of cloth with the asymmetric design for her arms and the various patterns and feathers are far more interesting than say the Great Fairies of OoT.

c) See point a. But what makes this argument most annoying is that you have zero context for her character. Remove context from all the characters listed above and guess what? They're *ALL* blatantly sexualized. For example- the artwork for Nabooru and Twinrova were far more sexualized than they actually were in the games."
58958,"Yeah, I'm skimming over that on *purpose* specifically to demonstrate my point. I don't disagree with the arguments about why the other characters aren't overly sexualized. But the vast majority of those arguments rely on the character's context. 

*We don't have context for Shia.* I can't stress that enough. We know she's a witch/villain of some sort, and that she dresses provocatively. *That's it.* That's all we know.

I don't think Nabooru is overly sexualized in OoT. But that's because I learned about her and her context by playing OoT. If all I knew about her was what she looked like and that she was a thief- I could make the exact same arguments against her that are being made against Shia.

That's my point. I'm trusting that Shia is going to be given context- I'm trusting that she'll make perfect sense once I've actually played the game and know what there is to know about her beyond her appearance.

In a way the arguments against her are no different than people hating and dismissing Wind Waker simply because it's cel-shaded. Everyone is judging this book by its cover, and I find that frustrating. Hence why I'm probably annoying you and others here by purposely only considering the ""covers"" of all those other characters."
