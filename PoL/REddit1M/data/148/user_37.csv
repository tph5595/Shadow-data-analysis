25039,Also... he's legit wearing eyeliner.  Not even just dark outlines to make his eyes more pronounced like you'd see in anime... straight up [eyeliner](http://www.gamecity.ne.jp/zelda/gallery/gal_02.jpg)
25455,"Veran at least was a unique design, with a point.  She looked like an evil witch, with a little bit of sexiness, and still, like 70% of her boobs were covered.

This new design is just shit, it looks exactly like the horrible bikini armor designs which covers like 10% of their tits, which you see in those free MMOs with horrible character design. It serves no design point other than ""look at these really big unoriginal titties!"""
25785,"So... boobs and characters that look like they're out out of a bad fighting game.  What part of this is Zelda again?  That you play as Link?

Hell, even while the characters look good *from a graphical point of view*... what's up with the stages?  They barely look any better than a Wii game.  I guess they're spending all their resources on making them boobs look real fine."
26022,"I guess they're technically branching out... but they're branching out in the same way that a nice family man with a great job ""branches out"" and starts shooting heroin into his eyeballs.

Letting Team Ninja touch your games... that's like trusting a 12 year old to cash your 5 grand cheque."
26140,"The Gerudo women wore tube-tops, which isn't anywhere *near* this new girls design, and it made sense seeing as they're from the desert and are designed to look somewhat Arabian.

This new girl is wearing the same old bikini armor that you see in every bad fighting game, or free MMO with horrible character design.  Makes no sense from any angle other than to show off those titties.  Pretty sad that garbage has made its way into Zelda."
26239,"&gt;That DLC button is giving us hope of a long and (hopefully) dynamic story

What?  How?  Since when is DLC (ESPECIALLY when the game hasn't even come out yet) been a good thing?"
26872,"They did a great job with Other M...?  It had *half decent*(and that's being generous) gameplay and everything else about the game was universally panned.  I wouldn't call that a great job, I'd call it one step away from a massive flop.

Also, it wasn't exactly ""Nintendo"" who was responsible for everything else, just Sakamoto, who is a huge tool.  He actually blamed Other M's failure on the fact that, and I quote, ""players were reluctant to accept a female character.""  Apparently, his idea of a female character is a whiny, useless, emotional trainwreck."
26991,Whose mask?  The new design?  Looks like some shit out of Bayonetta or Final Fantasy.
27165,"I suppose, but this is a Wii U game... they can do better.  This is barely any more improvement on previous Dynasty Warriors than if I were to run them on an emulator with all the graphical buffs on.  The environments look like an upscaled PS2 game."
27368,"The mask is alright, but still pretty unoriginal.  My problem comes from the fact that the character was designed around being sexual eye candy, which is pretty much Team Ninja's calling card.

Remember, they're the guys who made [Extreme Beach Volleyball](http://www.gamershell.com/static/screenshots/0/4319/69422_full.jpg).  The people who made a shameless boob-watching simulator are now working on a Zelda game... shame."
27820,"None of those characters come close to this new garbage.  Veran's design makes sense for what she is, and about 70% of her boobs are covered.  Iza is showing maybe.. 10%?  Telma, again, basic big-girl cleavage, nothing too crazy.  Plus, all of their designs make some degree of sense, from a clothing point of view, or to represent their character.  Sure, they have big boobs, but it's not even the same league and this new bs.

This new design is covering essentially nothing nipple/biking armor.  Covering maybe 20% of her tits, just enough so that you don't see nips.  It serves no real point and makes no sense from any angle other than ""hey look at these titties"", which is Team Ninja's calling card.

It's the same old unoriginal, uncreative, tacky bullshit you see in every free MMO.  Hell, it almost reminds me of those ads on Facebook which use designs like that to promote their *porn based games.*

Having big boobs isn't the same as walking around in something that covers nothing but your nipples."
27944,"Plot lines, no, but everything else about Zelda is pretty damn creative.  This new design is akin to those ads on Facebook you see, promoting porn-based fantasy RPGs.  It's a whole different league of unoriginal tackiness."
28144,"Yes... but you're not considering that Dynasty Warriors has been doing all of that for *years.*  It's the king of army-slayers, and has been for something like ten years, maybe more.  It's done all this before, on *much* more dated hardware.  You'd think that this time around, they'd be able to push a little more out of it, but it *barely* looks any different from the PS2 iterations, aside from the characters (which actually only look good in the cutscenes, from what I can tell)"
28323,Which is exactly what they're doing here. 
28816,"The scans that were posted all over r/Zelda yesterday said that you could 'unlock' a bunch of costumes by buying the 'premium' edition.  It's the first legitimate information release about the game, and they're already announcing DLC, while the game is still far from release.  There's also already a DLC button on their webpage.

DLC is something that should be - like you said - made *after* the game is finished and released, to add longevity.  Pre-planned/pre-release DLC is just a shameless moneygrab.  There's *no* reason that content couldn't be part of the release."
29787,"Naw, I get you, and I don't actually care that much.  I was just defending my point to the guy.  It *could* look better, but they choose to put the resources elsewhere, so it's whatever."
29832,"...

The day that shit makes it into Zelda, I am done with Zelda.  Luckily, this isn't actually Zelda."
30012,"It's creative within the universe it has set up for itself.  You can't change *everything* about the game, otherwise it isn't the same game.  Though, Nintendo often DOES do things very close to that.  Compare Ocarina of Time to Majoras Mask to Wind Waker.

Calling Zelda uncreative is idiotic."
30141,"Same here. Cosmetic items aren't the end of the world, but it's a slippery slope.  Though this is Team Ninja's, Omega Force and Tecmo's game, not *exactly* Nintendo's.  Since Nintendo is merely over-seeing/approving the project, I doubt the decision on how to use DLC came from them."
30259,"Actually, I have to go now!  But feel free to reply to any more of my comments, and I'll tell you why you're wrong when I get back.

Meanwhile, enjoy your faps to shamefully poor character design."
30569,"&gt;same game

I meant the same series/franchise.  But all in all, I agree with what you said here."
30737,"...It isn't, though.  It's a Dynasty Warriors spinoff, called Hyrule Warriors, made by Team Ninja and Omega Force.

If it were The Legend of Zelda, it would be called ""The Legend of Zelda"", be made by Nintendo, and play like Zelda.

This is/does none of those.  Now, I really do have to go.  Have a lovely day."
59328,She is a fish.
60520,And it still doesn't even compare.
71842,"If we're going direct, Veran covers about.. 60%-70%?  In what is essentially a tube-top.

This new one?  20%-30% covered maybe?  Mostly just the nipples.  In a design that says *nothing* other than ""hey look I'm a videogame character with tits"".

It's ""bikini armor"".  This shit is commonplace in every horrible, free MMO around.  It's pretty much the *exact* same design you see in those Facebook ads for porn-based fantasy RPGs."
72622,"And it makes sense for a fish person, who lives like a fish, to be ""nude"".  What sense does wearing armor that only covers your nipples make?  Other than pandering to horny 12 year old boys?

This shit is like comparing an ancient painting of a nude goddess to porn. "
77449,"&gt;Can't you enjoy character design without thinking about sex?! That's pervy.

I sure can when:

1.  The design *isn't* based around sex.
2.  The design is *good.*

This is neither of those.  Looks like something a horny 12 year old drew up, and it probably is, because it's from Team Ninja Titties."
77633,"Insecurities?  Discomfort?  Do you even know what those words mean?

Talking about why a shitty design is shitty has nothing to do with any of those.  The fact that your brain automatically jumped to that conclusion simply because someone finds a shitty design to be shitty says a lot about *you* though.

Listen, I understand.  You *really* enjoy those porn RPGs on Facebook, and virtual tits are your savior.  Makes sense that you're so drawn to it, seeing as it *is* aimed at horny 12 year olds."
