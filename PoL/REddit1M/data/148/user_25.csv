17590,"&gt;I don't mind the Great Fairy or Nabooru because they had reasonably sized breasts.

So it's not the nudity that matters as you claim, it's the size of their boobs that is the problem.

What's the matter with big boobs, huh buddy?"
23641,"Admist the rock people, the birds with human heads, and the magical flying *scarabs - I'm not really looking for realism when I'm playing Legend of Zelda.

And I'm not sure if I would consider [this](http://i909.photobucket.com/albums/ac296/custerjason/LegendofZeldaThe-OcarinaofTimeUV12snap0000.jpg?t=1287168094) more covered up. She's certainly much more sexualized, in my opinion, since she's only wearing plants.

As the previous user said, look at Impa. She's not sexualized at all, so I don't think you can say it's really a problem here if they're designing **one** character that way. That might be part of who she is - a woman that uses her sexuality to her advantage."
23848,"Right. This is a different company's take on character designs. They're of course going to look different. In fact, the only one that I think really looks in place is Link. Both of the boss enemies looks like characters from other games, and Impa *barely* fits because she has the same hairstyle as her Skyward Sword incarnation."
29636,Do you not realize that Shia is attracted to the hero so maybe she is trying to seduce him?
29859,"Everything about Zelda is pretty damn creative, since maybe the first Zelda.

The whole series recycles weapons, heroes, villians, general themes...I think it's as far from creative as it gets."
29910,"You know...me too, and not even in a Rule 34 way.

I think it can make sense for the character, given that we know she's attracted to the hero and she might use her sexuality to her advantage."
29971,"I agree! When I first heard about it I kept thinking ""Nintendo what are you doing?!"", but these shots fueled a lot of intrigue that I didn't have before."
29995,"So they let you do that in the ""Warriors"" games? I've never played."
30012,Yeah essentially. There's a trailer somewhere which shows some early development game play.
30065,"Man, you have nothing better to do all day than complain about them boobies huh? Your name is littered throughout the thread talking about it.

Are you sure you're upset they're in the game?"
30408,"&gt;You can't change everything about the game, otherwise it isn't the same game

I'm saying your goal shouldn't be to make the same game. What's the point of making the same game again?

I think that certain aspects of the Legend of Zelda are very unique by splitting off the main path, and those games tend to be my favorite (e.g. Majora's Mask, Link's Awakening, A Link Between Worlds, Spirit Tracks).

I'm *tired* of seeing Ganondorf come back again and again. I know they address this with Skyward Sword, but I'd still rather see new villians and new worlds."
30478,"I think this is pretty much Legend of Zelda, but you can view it as you want.

In the meantime, we'll have fun enjoying the franchise while you go sulk in the corner."
30598,"It's a *big* departure from anything Legend of Zelda. I think it will probably throw off a lot of Zelda fans, but I think it will have potential to be a fun Saturday afternoon of gaming.

I personally have always wanted a Zelda game where you have a lot more combat. This might be too far in the opposite direction, but I am certainly willing to give it a shot."
30682,"&gt;and I'll tell you why you're wrong when I get back.

Haha that's rich! You'll tell me I'm wrong about preferences?

I have no big opinion about the character design, since these are only images from a game we know next to nothing about. I'll reserve my judgment when I can actually, y'know, *play* the game."
30856,"If this becomes official canon, like Other M some how is, are you going to stop playing Zelda?

Have a lovely day as well. Hopefully you're willing to give the game a chance."
30914,"Well sure, certain elements they should keep, but I've been aching for Nintendo to do *anything* different with the series which can really keep me on my toes."
32882,"I don't have high hopes, but we shall soon see."
32940,That sounds pretty cool. Now you're getting my hopes all up.
96064,Why more?
97079,"Hm well...I acknowledge your point but I disagree. I think it adds further depth to a story that always has been ""Princess captured, go to dungeons, rescue Princess""."
106466,"I'm using capture loosely. I suppose ""in peril"" might be more accurate."
