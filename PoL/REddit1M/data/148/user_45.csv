26468,"[Thats right](http://zeldawiki.org/Hyrule_Warriors). Combines the action of Tecmo Koei's Dynasty Warriors and the Nintendo world, that is, Legend of Zelda. Supposedly, there will be much more combat in this game but still will keep the Zelda Series concepts (i.e. heart pieces, weapons, etc). What i'm really excited about is the fact that Link will be able to fight alongside other Hyrule soldiers against hordes of demons and such.

It's this kind of game that will compel me to purchase a Wii U.
