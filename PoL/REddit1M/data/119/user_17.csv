26628,"I read somewhere once that Miyamoto considers the Mario cast to be actors in a play, and that's how Mario and Bowser can go from figuring each other over Peach to racing together in Mario Kart or playing soccer, tennis, etc. Each of the games, then, is a play with a story that is relatively isolated from all the other ones. Also, this is how Mario 2 and 3 got curtains. 

I'm more than fine with considering Zelda the same way. There is a princess who is fending off or attacked by a bad guy, and a brave hero to come and defeat the bad guy and save or help the princess. Works for me. Since I've had a relatively on-again/off-again with the games between BotW and the original LoZ, I don't really care much about the continuity anyway, just that the gameplay is fun and the story is interesting.
