LA was a sequel to LoZ, ALttP a prequel to those, and OoT a prequel to that. This isn't secret information; they are usually pretty clear about how one game relates to at least one prior one. Even this game, as unrevealing as it is, is clearly a sequel to SS and OoT. The creators' statement here means nothing. It's just a reiteration if what they always have said: gameplay first, story second. That doesn't mean they're discarding the timeline. They just won't let it limit themselves as they keep developing the series."

So basically they can create whatever world and story they want to suit the gameplay, but that doesn't mean there isn't some kind of timeline."
