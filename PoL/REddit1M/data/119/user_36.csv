#Huge spoilers obviously.

During her research with Purah and Robbie, Zelda discovered the shrine of resurrection. She wanted it to be functionnal, just in case, for when Ganon attacked.

During Memory 17, Link almost dies, but on Fi's advice (who states Link is not quite dead) Zelda orders sheikahs to conduct him to the shrine of resurrection.

It's mentionned Purah and Robbie were there when Link was put to sleep, and the sheikah slate is in the shrine of resurrection when the game starts, so I would imagine Zelda gathers Robbie and Purah, and escorts them to the shrine of resurrection. Robbie and Purah take care of the medical procedure, and Zelda goes off to the lost woods to put the MS there, and leaving the sheikah slate in the shrine.

After that, Ganon's still rampaging, so Zelda has to go to Hyrule Castle and using her new power, use herself to seal Ganon. So she's stuck in Hyrule Castle during the 100 years because the alternative would be giving Ganon a free pass to end Hyrule.

Link awoke 100 years later because that's the time it took for the shrine of resurrection to patch him up."
