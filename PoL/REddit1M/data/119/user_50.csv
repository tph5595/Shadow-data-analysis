That said, we're also told that there are ""thousands"" of years between Demise's invasion into the world and the events of SS. So ten thousand years is pretty comparable to the ""thousands"" of years between SS and its back story (since that amount of time could be more or less than BotW's 10,000 years)."

While I haven't committed to a theory for BotW's placement yet, we were told in the game 1) that there was a sudden catastrophic drought in this Hyrule's past that caused a sea to dry up, 2) that the birthplace of this Hyrule is the Great Plateau, which is an extremely elevated piece of land, and 3) that BotW's Zora's Domain is a brand new place that was founded around the time of the Great Calamity. While none of these three things confirm that we're in a post-ST era, they all lend credibility to that theory, so it might be less unlikely a theory than it appears on its face."
