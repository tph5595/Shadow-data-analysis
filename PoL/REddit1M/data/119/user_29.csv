LA is a sequel to LttP though and the same Link from those games is also the Link in the Oracle games.  I never was a fan of the time line though, I've always spoke out against it.  I believed the game should come first and if you can find a way to tie them together after, that's cool.  But just sprinkling in the easter eggs as homage to fans is usually better."
