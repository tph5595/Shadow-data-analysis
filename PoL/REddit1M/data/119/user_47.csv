45784,"Fans started the timeline theory back in the '90s after ALttP, and Miyamoto confirmed they internally had a loose timeline that the games follow all the way back in 1997/98. The emphasis was on ""loose"" as in they do fit into a timeline but they don't let it restrict them from doing things they think will be fun.

It wasn't to hype SS, it wasn't even really to hype OoT as the hype for that game likely could not have been higher. It was just a fun anecdote for the fans, acknowledging what was suspected for years, and it just grew into this ungainly beast and started restricting what they felt they could do creatively. So they're back to basics and either ignoring the now convoluted timelines and where this game ""fits"", or they've just merged them in order to keep it simpler from here on out."

Listen closer next time. They're all over the place."
48877,"Why do people keep bringing up SS and Hyrule Historia? Miyamoto confirmed there was a loose timeline for the games back in 1997/98, this wasn't something they just arbitrarily came up with for SS. All HH did was canonize the prevailing fan theory that there must be alternate timelines for WW and TP to make sense together."
50184,"Yeah they confirmed they have a loose timeline back in the late '90s. It was the fans that took that far more literally than it needed to be taken. Nintendo had a loose timeline for the purpose of being able to make references and easter eggs in their games, something to make the long time fans go ""OH! That's where that comes from!"" but not to so strictly adhere to things that newcomers can't enjoy the games as their own individual experience without having to first dive down a lore hole to catch up on what's happened. 

It was the fans that forced them to officially split the timelines because WW doesn't make any sense being on the same timeline as ALttP, then later neither did TP. So rather than just enjoying the games as individual experiences that loosely tie in with the other games, they pestered Nintendo to convolute things in order to appease a rabid fanbase that just couldn't be happy with WW and TP taking place with the other games. 

BoTW is Nintendo taking back control of something that was spiraling out of control and taking away their creative freedom. It still falls onto their established ""loose"" timeline as the new ""end"", but it doesn't adhere strictly to either of the split timelines."
51162,"&gt; There's so much to work with. The story is so malleable and it's pretty exciting to me, to find things like map comparisons and references buried away that tickle my brain and make me wonder ""What if...?""

Yeah that's what's fun for me. I love timeline theorycrafting and seeing all the references I recognize, even seeing map similarities from the earliest games (LoZ map is miniaturized in the southwest corner of AoLs map. And if you rotate AoLs map 90 degrees, it fits nicely as a slightly flooded version on the eastern half of BoTW, or rotate ALttPs map 45 degrees and it matches up almost feature for feature with BoTW.)

But I take every game on its own merit and references are just that, references. It doesn't matter to me where or even if the games fall into a timeline as long as it's a fun game. I much rather they focus on making the games fun, than backing themselves into a corner creatively, in order to slot a game into a strict timeline."
91050,"The canon timeline, at the time, was that adult Link defeated Ganondorf, and went back to his child time to warn child Zelda before any of that stuff could happen. One timeline, not two (or three.) Not two different endings.

The ""other ending"" you see, is actually what Link is seeing while in the sacred realm before being sent back to his child time. While Zelda is playing the ocarina he's seeing all the good that came about from ridding Hyrule of Ganondorf: ""peace will reign once again in this world... for a time"", and then it ends with him in the Temple of Time having set the Master Sword back in it's pedestal, Navi flies away as she's helped Link fulfill his destiny, and child Link goes to find child Zelda to warn her about Ganondorf, leading to his capture and execution (or failed execution as we eventually see in TP), preventing his rise to conquer Hyrule from ever happening in the first place. You never see adult Link in those scenes because he's in the sacred realm, outside of time, there were not two versions of Link. There was no child/adult timeline split back then, because Link wasn't given the choice to either stay on as an adult, or go back to his original time.

Zelda even says that she is going to make up for the mistakes that she caused by being too young to understand the consequences of what would happen if Ganondorf gained control of the Sacred Realm. She's sending you back to ""seal the door of time"" by placing the Master Sword back in it's pedestal, and to warn her child self about what Ganondorf will do in the future, preventing the adult Link timeline from ever happening, wiping all of that from existence: ""by doing this the road between times will be closed"" The canon ending is the child Link ending.

Then Wind Waker happens and just doesn't make any sense anywhere on the known timeline, we knew it was after OoT, but it also was before LoZ and there was nothing indicating a flooded Hyrule in LoZ or AoL, nor ALttP, LA or the Oracles, unless they were going to set it way after AoL, but then why only have references to OoT and nothing referencing ALttP or any of the other games? So in an interview around the release of WW, when asked where it fits on the timeline, Aonuma says ""there were two endings to OoT, one as an adult, and one as a child"". So ok, my choice of ""fans forced them"" was not entirely correct, what happened is they retconned the canon OoT ending (child Link) to turn it into two endings because wibbly wobbly timey wimey, and they now have an explanation how WW fits."
132110,"There's nothing to ""misunderstand"". You defeated Ganon in the adult timeline, then you were sent back to the child timeline, cutting off the adult timeline's existence. The hero ""left"" after fixing things *because he was sent back in time, to his child timeline*. There was never two timelines or two endings to OoT, there was no adult hero after OoT, not until they retconned it for WW.

I've been with this series, every game, since 1987. I've been involved with the timeline theorycrafting since the early 90s. I know full well how the timeline works, and how they have retconned it whenever needed over the years in order to make games fit. They've even confirmed it, most recently not only with Aunoma talking about how Hyrule's history has changed, but even Hyrule Encyclopedia has moved around some things again, putting the Oracles after LA, and having their Link not the same as ALttP and LA after years of the Oracles being set before LA and all 4 games having the same Link. They've also said numerous times that they are not going to let the timeline restrict them creatively. Allowing them to change it whenever they want or need to.

The adult/child split timeline did not happen until WW needed it to in order to make sense. If you are too young to have been around at the time it was first talked about, or if you simply don't want to believe me, then how about you Google when the first mention of a split timeline was. I'll give you a hint: it was around WWs launch, and never before that."
156796,"&gt; So which is it? The adult timeline doesn't exist, even though its existence is necessary for OOT to happen, or the adult timeline does exist, and adult link left?

I'm not sure why this is so difficult to understand. Once you complete the game and go back to the child timeline, the adult timeline no longer exists. The very act of going back in time to warn the child Zelda about Ganondorf before he can act which leads to his capture and (failed) execution, you prevent the adult Link timeline from ever happening.

&gt; I don't think you understand what the word ""retcon"" means.

Pretty sure I do...

&gt; The depiction of fictional events, as in a television series or comic book, that entail a revision of the narrative presented in an earlier installment.

Yep, I do.

&gt; So basically your argument boils down to ""They didn't bring it up until it needed bringing up, in the very next game in the series, that means they made it up out of their asses to appease people"". Doesn't that sound...ridiculous?

The next game in the series was Majora's Mask, a direct sequel to OoT and following the same child Link ending.

With Wind Waker they used OoTs time travel as a convenient way to serve as the jump point between two parallel worlds, or a branch in the timeline (*because they were already getting asked by fans how this waterworld Zelda fits in the timeline before the game even launched*.)

&gt; Also, OOT's ending literally features Ganondorf, in the adult timeline, threatening to return.

Yes. And then you travel back in time and prevent that from ever happening by defeating Ganondorf before he can conquer Hyrule in the first place.

&gt; The ending literally features Zelda saying that peace is restored to this land and for now, referring to ganondorf's eventual possible return.

Or it's referring to ""once the door is closed and you warn my younger self about Ganondorf, this time will no longer exist. So we'll enjoy this peaceful world...for now"""
160797,"&gt; If the adult timeline never happens, how does link recollect it all to zelda to get ganondorf locked up?

...because Link lived it. Link lifted the Master Sword, went to sleep for 7 years, fought and defeated Ganon/dorf, and then he traveled back in time to warn Zelda, because he saw what Ganon/dorf does in the future. That prevents the future from happening, it doesn't prevent his memory of it happening.

You keep going on what Zelda literally said, and what Ganondorf literally said. Well, Zelda also literally says ""I'm going to make up for the mistakes I made"" when she tells Link she's going to send him back... how does sending Link back in time to warn her younger self correct her mistakes, if the adult timeline still exists and all the mistakes she made still happened? She'd be preventing another Zelda (child) from making the same mistakes in a completely different timeline from her own, but she wouldn't be making up for those mistakes in her own timeline.

Or is it that she knows that by sending Link back to warn her younger self it will correct the mistakes she made by preventing everything from happening as it did, but also remove her adult self and this now peaceful but ruined Hyrule out of existence as a consequence? Do you live with what happened, all the hearache you caused (she feels responsible for it, whether she technically was or not), or do you reset the clock and do things differently by sending a messenger back to your younger self, preventing all the heartache from happening in the first place?

&gt; So you are saying there's NO WAY they had this planned before people started asking? Come the fuck on..

Nintendo have always said they have a loose timeline that they work from for the games, but they don't let that restrict them from doing whatever they think is going to be creative or fun for future installments of the game. Did they have this split timeline planned before people started asking? I dunno. But I do know that nothing up to that point had ever hinted that there would be diverging timelines where different realities exist based off the probable endings of any of the games, because every game up to that point followed a linear timeline from OoT to AoL.

Even TP, for a long time before Hyrule Historia, was officially placed on the (now) downfall timeline (back then it was just the child timeline), taking place before ALttP and after MM (and fans debated whether it was the aftermath of the Imprisoning War, or something else entirely). So it seemed for the majority of a decade that WW and it's direct sequels were the outliers in an otherwise linear story from MC to AoL, and SS was going to tell the beginning of the legend. Then Hyrule Historia comes out and suddenly we have three official timelines (which fans had also debated before Nintendo officially put it to print). To me, it seems like they're just kinda making it up as they go along, more or less to shush the fans that *need* everything tied up with a neat little bow, who can't just enjoy the games all being loosely related outside of the few that are direct sequels."
