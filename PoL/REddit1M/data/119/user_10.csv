13565,"Good, binding tLoZ to restrictions &amp; lore from games before any coherent overarching plot was required, or even wanted, would unnecessarily handicap new or other forms of game-play (which might not have been invented yet).

It would be unfair, unrealistic, and disadvantageous for both creators as well as players. 

Reboot, restructure, reinmagine. I look forward to where they, and we, may take the series."
