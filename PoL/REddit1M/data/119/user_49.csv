53815,"Yeah, it's funny to me for a couple of different reasons...1) They generally have a pretty thin plot, BOTW included. Our minds kind of fill in the gaps, not with substance necessarily, but the characters kind of fit in with classic tropes/archetypes. The name Link is actually the literal manifestation of this idea...he has basically no personality, it's whatever the player wants him to be. He is named Link because it was the player's link to the world inside of the game. 2) The downfall timeline is reeks of desperation to retrofit the timeline. I mean really, did some kids stop playing after they lost to Ganon at the end of OoT? The two way time split is actually a super novel idea, I think the downfall thing is pretty dumb though. I mean, couldn't Link have died in any of the games?"
