This means that trying to reconcile every piece of lore in the game to create a perfect fit is foolish. But throwing up your hands and saying that there is no timeline is also foolish - as we have been told time and time again that there is a timeline.

In other words - Aonuma is simply reiterating a fact of the series that has always been with us. This isn't anything new."
