Zelda has always been like Final Fantasy; retaining elements and mechanics from (and references to) previous titles but being stand alone for the most.  The whole 'timeline' nonsense was just retrofitting, pure and simple; it didn't make sense when it happened (*split timelines*...oh please) and didn't make sense after.  And Aonuma and co. who came up with that nonsense have finally seen it for what it is; not adding complexity but adding limitation.  They're painted into a corner and BotW (hopefully) has finally freed them from it.

Zelda isn't about lore, it's *never* been about lore.  This isn't a franchise of complex histories, civilizations...or even characters (let alone *world* development).  The kind of character development that *does* happen in a Zelda game is akin to what you'd see in a children's cartoon.  Zelda, like the Mario series, is designed based on gameplay first and context after - it has about as much *lore* as the Mario series.  See anyone in the Super Mario sub arguing about split/converged timelines?  Because if you think that's silly, remember that Super Mario's worlds have changed just as much as Zelda's.

This isn't Elder Scrolls or Tolkien.  These are just light-hearted games and they're brilliant *because* they are light-hearted; I wouldn't have it any other way.  Because what Zelda games lack in depth for their worlds, locations and characters they make up for with personality and charm.  I'd rather have depth in gameplay and mechanics and a charming world rather than the other way around and that's exactly what Breath of the Wild is and why I'm so happy with it."

Mario and Sonic happened in the 'Luigi screwed Peach' timeline. "
42813,"Literally, could not matter less; it might matter to you but it doesn't matter to the series.  You don't need to have played or understood Ocarina of Time to fully appreciate Wind Waker, Majora's Mask or Breath of the Wild, nor does knowing the former's details make the latter's experiences any richer.  The original NES LoZ or Link's Awakening aren't given more depth by Link to the Past.  Gorons don't become a complex civilization just because one was in Skyward Sword and while the the ruins of Lon Lon Ranch might be sad to see in Breath of the Wild, they're simply a reference, not added depth (because they have nothing to contribute except just being a nod to a previous game).

These are all just Easter Eggs and that's it.

Defending this as 'word building' is the same mentality defending Skyward Sword's silly 'level glueing'.  In Skyward Sword, the world was completely overcast with clouds except for these holes to drop through and land in specific region...except that after you dropped, you looked up and see clear blue skies to the horizon; it made literally no sense whatsoever.  In the same way, the continent and landmasses shifting in Zelda don't make remotely any sense whatsoever - but a writer (who couldn't care less) simply types in 'thousands of years ago...' and suddenly people rush to defend it as if it makes sense now.  Landmasses don't change so drastically, civilizations don't stagnate and if you want to argue it's ""fantasy"" or ""magic"", well I could use the same argument to connect Sonic 06 to the Zelda timeline.

People just need to let it go.  They're light-hearted games.  Their creators don't even take them as seriously as their fanbase seems to.

If you want to argue semantics and technicalities, you'll have to do it amongst yourselves.  I'm tired of just repeating myself over and over to make the same point in circles :/"

Of course Ocarina of Time would be still highly regarded as an extraordinary and revolutionary game; what was revolutionary about it was the level (dungeon) designs, the progression system, the revolutionary mechanics (Z-targeting and such), controls and context sensitive design approach, etc. which are all monumentally more important than the cut scenes glueing them together.  You change any of those around and the game's quality is directly impacted; you change the cut scenes around and all that does is change the context slightly - it has *no* impact on quality.  If Sheikah *wasn't* Zelda, if Link was a Gerudo instead of a Hylian, if Ganon *wasn't* introduced until the end, the game wouldn't have been *any* less enjoyable or impactful, just a slightly (read: *minutely*) different experience.  Those things are cool, thoughtful and charming sure...but they're simply garnish.

Case in point: the original LoZ that booted the ENTIRE franchise has no story elements outside of 'go save a princess', 'oh, you saved her'.  Is *that* game less significant as a result?  Nintendo games have never been about *story*, always about *characters* and each character is only relevant to their respective game.

As for my Mario analogy, I really don't see how Breath of the Wild's story is any different than Super Mario Galaxy's.  

 - A princess is kidnapped by a baddie

 - You save princess by beating baddie, end credits

 - You meet characters along the way who basically talk *at* you to introduce problems for you to solve

 - one character (a princess, funnily enough) has the most bare-boned, basically *contrived* character development ever via flashbacks you learn about in segments

 - ...that's it :/

And yet, no one is struggling to link Mario Odyssey to Galaxy and the Mario and Luigi series and which timeline Mario RPG is part of.  And hey, Super Mario Galaxy 2 was a direct sequel to Galaxy 1 so story must be important to this franchise too...no?  :/

Look, I'm not arguing that there shouldn't be story in Zelda games.  Like I said before, Nintendo's worlds and stories aren't deep but that doesn't mean they lack character or personality.  They're hugely charming and I love how they are.  But even Nintendo doesn't take their storylines as seriously as their fanbase does; what their fans argue is sacred, the devs are clearly just throwing up in the air and winging it.

These are light-hearted games.  That doesn't make them *lesser*, it just adds to how much heart and charm they have."

See any timeline talk before that?"

You'd think not but apparently..."
89922,"Of all the replies I've gotten in this thread, I appreciate yours the most.  I don't entirely agree with everything you say but you make your point very well regardless.

I totally agree with your point on ambiguity, though, and I agree that it doesn't just allow for imagination to fill the gaps but encourages it.  And I think that's something they can do without a rigid timeline stifling them; they can throw in easter eggs and references as they like but I'd rather developers weren't anchored by conventions but rather free to do anything they want with each game (that's how we got BotW after all).  Let the fans speculate but as dev, throw away the timeline and use YOUR imagination.

Also, my point wasn't to say that the story of Zelda is simply 'save princess', it's that it doesn't *need* anymore depth.  What Nintendo does exceptionally well is exchange depth for charm and personality.  And that goes a very long way too :) "
