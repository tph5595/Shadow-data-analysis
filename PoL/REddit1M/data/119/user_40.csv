40907,"This game takes place a *minimum* of 10,100 years in the future to the last game. Even if it does fit into a timeline, it's so far into the future that it's basically a complete disconnect."
55776,"It's stated that it's been 10,000 years in the memories; which took place in the past. At the time Link wakes up, it's 10,100 years since the last possible game (the Great Calamity). Ganons return was after 10,000 years. Also, the gap between the beginning of time and SS is the only gap comparable to BotW's. Most other Zelda games are within a few hundred years of each other; not a few thousand. "
