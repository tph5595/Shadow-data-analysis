28081,"It bothers me. You don't just establish canon, and then go no wait nevermind. Especially when the result is a situation where events that cannot possibly have occurred in tandem now occurred in tandem. "
35121,"Complete bull. There has been an established timeline since zelda 2.

2 is direct sequel to 1.

Lttp establishes the events that happened in ocarina of time.

Ocarina of time establishes the executed Ganondorf of Twilight Princess. 

Majoras Mask is a direct sequel to oot. 

Links awakening is a direct sequel to Lttp.

Skyeard sword establishes itself as the start of everything. 

Wind Waker establishes itself as a sequel to oot.

Not one of those is established by fans. "
81247,"uhhh the fact that OOT has two separate endings, one for each separate canon timeline, seems to indicate that there is no ""fans forced nintendo to make up a timeline to explain wind waker"" going on. Wind waker explains its own timeline positioning literally in the opening cutscene, too. Did fans force nintendo to make that cutscene, after the game came out, then somehow retroactively inject it into their game discs? No, they didn't. "
120092,"They didn't retcon a thing. It's not their fault you don't understand how the timeline work. Wind Waker tells you, once again, that Ganon was defeated (only possible in adult timelime) and that the hero didn't show up next time (because the hero from the adult timeline LEFT after fixing things). "
142393,"&gt; cutting off the adult timeline's existence.

&gt;The hero ""left"" after fixing things because he was sent back in time, to his child timeline. 

So which is it? The adult timeline doesn't exist, even though its existence is necessary for OOT to happen, or the adult timeline does exist, and adult link left?

&gt;There was never two timelines or two endings to OoT, there was no adult hero after OoT, not until they retconned it for WW.

I don't think you understand what the word ""retcon"" means.

&gt;The adult/child split timeline did not happen until WW needed it to in order to make sense. 

So basically your argument boils down to ""They didn't bring it up until it needed bringing up, in the very next game in the series, that means they made it up out of their asses to appease people"". Doesn't that sound...ridiculous? 

Also, OOT's ending **literally features Ganondorf, in the adult timeline, threatening to return.** The ending **literally features Zelda saying the road between times will close**. Notthat one will cease to exist. That the road between them will close. As in, both are still here, but you can't come here. The ending literally features Zelda saying that peace is restored **to this land** and **for now**, referring to ganondorf's eventual possible return. 


"
157248,"&gt;Once you complete the game and go back to the child timeline, the adult timeline no longer exists. The very act of going back in time to warn the child Zelda about Ganondorf before he can act which leads to his capture and (failed) execution, you prevent the adult Link timeline from ever happening.

No, dude. This isn't that kind of time travel. This is ""You got on a bus to another point in time"" time travel. If the adult timeline never happens, how does link recollect it all to zelda to get ganondorf locked up? If the adult timeline was erased, why does adult zelda say that her time is safe for now? If theadult timwline was erased, why does ganondorf threaten to return to it later?

YOU are injecting this into the story, this idea of ""It stopped existing"". That's not the time travel idea Nintendo went with. 

&gt;(because they were already getting asked by fans how this waterworld Zelda fits in the timeline before the game even launched.)

So you are saying there's NO WAY they had this planned before people started asking? Come the fuck on.."
