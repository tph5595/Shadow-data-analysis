43304,"A midquel?  **Complicated**?  Oh no!  I had numbers 1 and 3, and then number 2 appeared!

Next you'll tell me a timeline split is even more complicated, because 1, 2, A3, A4 and 1, 2, B3, B4 is just an unreasonable linear system."
43553,"He's pretty clearly talking in-world... like, the history *within* Hyrule has changed just like history books in schools change, which allows for inaccuracies in-world.

It means ""Don't worry about the details"", like having places named after every character from the entire series all in one game.

It doesn't mean there has never been or isn't a timeline anymore.

Also, did any of you read the Hyrule Historia?  Aonuma said this exact same thing in the author's notes in that book.  History changes and even the Historia's timeline may be subject to change if new things come up.  And then they proceeded to confirm the timeline placements of ALBW and TFH when those games released.  (And as it happens, those two games DID change the timeline because they delayed the Golden Age after ALttP by another several generations.  Just like he said.)

What makes this statement ""confirming they're ignoring the timeline""?  Is this going to be one of those things people cite as ""damning fact"" 10 years later, after BotW, Zelda 20, Zelda 21, and Zelda 22 have all had confirmed timeline placements but people still want to believe that a timeline isn't real for some reason?

Also, there has been a timeline since Adventure of Link came out.  I dare you to prove me wrong.

------

Also also, how is having no timeline ""growing as a community""?  Like, cool.  Now there are fewer things to talk about.  Want to talk about how Hyrule fell due to Ganon and eventually survived only through a cleansing armageddon and became reborn as New Hyrule?  Nah, there's no timeline anymore, so that plot doesn't exist, because those games can't be linearly connected."
76190,"You think Miyamoto is the only writer on the Zelda team?

Why does Miyamoto not caring about the timeline override Aonuma caring about the timeline, btw?"
76278,"&gt; and it just grew into this ungainly beast and started restricting what they felt they could do creatively

They've never once said that.

They have repeatedly said throughout the series' history that they **don't allow it to restrict them**.  By default.

This is not ""it was chafing so we got rid of it"".  This statement from Aonuma is just the same thing they've always said."
76427,"&gt; There was never really supposed to be a consistent Zelda timeline

Adventure of Link is a sequel to The Legend of Zelda.  Explicitly.

The box of A Link to the Past also [explicitly states it is a prequel to The Legend of Zelda](https://gamefaqs.akamaized.net/box/3/2/2/18322_back.jpg):

&gt;The predecessors of Link and Zelda face monsters...

Immediately related directly to the original two games."
76627,"&gt; not to so strictly adhere to things that newcomers can't enjoy the games as their own individual experience without having to first dive down a lore hole to catch up on what's happened.

Where has anybody said this is the case?  Since when has Nintendo claimed that the timeline restricts them or shown any indication that it does?

The Historia literally has an author's note stating ""HEY GUYS WE'RE ABLE TO CHANGE THIS THING IF WE WANT JUST SO YOU'RE CLEAR!  :)""  They released the timeline with a giant sticky note attached saying &lt;not a restrictive device&gt;.

&gt;It was the fans that forced them to officially split the timelines

Have you played Ocarina of Time?  Beaten it and watched the credits?

Because Ocarina of Time has two endings.

One shows Lon Lon Ranch, with all the characters from the Adult Branch partying after Ganondorf's defeat.  The Awakened Sages fly away to do whatever they do as Sages.

The other ending shows Link entering the Child Branch to warn Zelda of her failed plan.

These two endings are incompatible.  They are part of Ocarina of Time, exclusively.  The timeline split was canon *the day Ocarina of Time was released*.  Claiming it was invented by fans is pure ignorance."
76772,"They won't stop using the timeline.  Every time Aonuma or Nintendo in general says something that can be interpreted anti-timeline, anti-timeline people take it as pure gospel that he's done with it.

And then a few weeks/months/years later Aonuma confirms the latest game's timeline placement.

"
76786,Which games in the series have been restricted by the timeline thusfar?
76896,"How can the story about a princess splitting the Triforce of Wisdom and being rescued by the Hero be the same story as the Hero forging a sword to fight a demon-god from Basically Hell and the same story as seven maidens getting captured by a Wind Sorcerer and a single Hero split into four Heroes saving them?

Also, how does the ""retelling"" bit justify the fact that every single Zelda game has an explicit connection to at least one other, in the form of backstory?"
76970,"&gt; There's nothing preventing previous games/stories from happening between the Calamity Ganon of 10,000 years ago, and the one from 100 years ago.

Purah's journal does claim that Ganon had been sealed those entire 10,000 years, so unless she is faulty, any games in between would need to be not-Ganon.

Not that I have a problem with that."
77012,Which games don't fit?
77049,How can you draw connections if there's no timeline?
77304,"&gt; Some games went together

- AoL sequel to TLoZ

- ALttP prequel to TLoZ (origin story of Ganon)

- LA sequel to ALttP (the game says Link has defeated Ganon and become a Hero)

- OoT prequel to ALttP (origin story of Ganondorf, as named in the ALttP backstory) (establishes the 2-way timeline split in the credits cutscene)

- MM sequel to OoT-Child

- OoX kind of nebulous, so the first game in the series to not have a clear connection to one other

- WW direct sequel to OoT (explicitly describing the Hero of Time's heroics)

- Four Swords standalone for now, no relation to others yet

- Minish Cap prequel to FS (Vaati and Four Sword origin story)

- FSA sequel to Minish Cap, (takes place sometime after a Ganon died so he could be reincarnated)

- TP sequel to OoT-Child/MM (Ganondorf executed due to Link tattling on him)

- PH direct sequel to WW

- ST direct sequel to PH, literally detailed ingame

77427,"They said they don't let it restrict them - which is the same thing they always say, including **in the Historia** - not that it doesn't matter."
78321,Surprise for you: Adventure of Link was a sequel to The Legend of Zelda.
78357,"Yes, it's a sequel in the franchise.  It's a prequel in the plot.  This isn't hard.

Are you suggesting that the box text is mistaken or lying to us?  Why?"
78593,"&gt;If it's not explicitly referencing its predecessors in the game itself

While it does not do this, it gives Ganon an origin story -- one which logically cannot occur after TLoZ (Ganondorf is born a man, gets the Triforce, becomes a demon, and then remains in the Sacred Realm/Dark World until the events of ALttP).  Thus, taken on its own, ALttP is quite clearly a prequel to begin with -- the box just confirms it outright.

Technically that could all be after TLoZ if we assumed another Ganondorf was born after AoL, but we're in the universe where the creators did not decide to go that route and instead picked the other 50/50 where there is only one Ganon (until FSA came out).

&gt; Any sense of a link was certainly dead by the time OoT came out.

Ocarina of Time, the game that shows us the evil man Ganondorf seeking the Triforce and transforming into Ganon when he gets it?  Like the plot in-game in ALttP said - albeit with some in-world inconsistencies (such as him having a small army)?

&gt;any sense of a consistent timeline in Zelda was abandoned twenty years before this post was created

Proof?  The developers have been saying they have an internal timeline document forever."
79124,"That was an error in localization, yes.

Anyway, ALttP details the origin story of Ganon.  So, logically, the game already places itself prior to The Legend of Zelda.  Can you deny this?

By the by, downvoting people you're arguing with doesn't make your argument stronger."
79424,"Allow me to elaborate.

There has been a timeline since the second game came out.  1 -&gt; 2.  Denying this isn't possible, since the plot of Adventure of Link is totally dependent on being a sequel.

The third game in the series described the origin story of Ganon, a character from the first game in the series.  3 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2.

There is no ""retrofitting"" needed here.  Those games have always already fit together.  You can try to prove me wrong if you want."
80421,"But how can you draw meaningful connections if there's no timeline?  You can't say one game comes before or after another if there's officially no timeline, so they can't be connected in significant ways.

I can't say: ""I wonder what Vaati is up to in the Adult Branch"" because there is no timeline - he simply doesn't exist there if there is no timeline.  In fact, I can't even say that the Hero of Winds created New Hyrule if there is no timeline."
102934,All I did was state a list of in-game facts.  There are no opinions here.  Feel free to request citations if you haven't played or have forgotten some pieces - I kept it short for the sake of brevity but I will certainly go seek out the cutscenes and dialogues that prove these facts.
103128,"&gt; do you believe Nintendo was secretly withholding the fact that ""oh, there's THREE branching timelines, and we just won't reveal it for the next 8 years""? 

Yes.  The creation of the Fallen Branch was probably a mistake -- by the time TP came out, it was obvious we had 3 sequels to a game with 2 endings.  That was one big continuity error.  In a 30-year long series.

So they came up with a solution.

And Nintendo **has** told us, in the past, that they had a secret timeline document they were withholding.  Do ""Do I believe that?""  Yes.  Why the fuck wouldn't I believe that?  They told me that's what they were doing.

&gt;They've been making it all up as they go along. It's okay. There was no grand Zelda vision set out 40 years ago, that somehow all these new Zelda games are built in accordance to.

...I know that?  Why does that mean that the timeline isn't real and has never been real?

When The Legend of Zelda came out the timeline was 1.  When Adventure of Link came out it was 1 - &gt; 2.  When A Link to the Past came out, it was 3 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 2.

Out of curiosity, do you like Star Wars?  Do you think the newest set of movies are canon to Star Wars?  Because they weren't planned when the original trilogy came out.

&gt;BotW doesn't fit at all.

How does BotW not fit?  It fits at the end of the Fallen Branch with no issue."
103432,"Well, that's the problem.  We do have timeline support for just about every game.

People who deny that just aren't aware of the facts in each game."
116900,"This is already what they do, though.  Except less than ""an afterthought"", they just don't let the existing timeline restrict them.

Look at ALBW - that game fits into the timeline but its backstory also completely screws with the known history of that era.  It talks about the Era of Chaos, Ocarina of Time, and then skips ALttP, and then talks about something SIMILAR to ALttP but with a different ending.

ALBW still fits in the timeline.

This has been the case forever.  It's not going to change and it's not new, and it doesn't mean the timeline isn't present."
116929,"How could Ganondorf get resurrected if he's sealed away?

For the record I'm not claiming that Purah's journal MUST be 100% accurate, but for now with no conflicting evidence I'm assuming it probably is."
117633,"I mean he can't be sealed away and running around being a villain at the same time.  Unless it's an Agahnim situation and he sends out an alter-ego to try to free himself.

Actually I wouldn't hate that."
120617,"&gt; They're just there.

Ok?  What does this have to do with the timeline?"
123617,I'm not sure what your point is.  Are you arguing in favor of the timeline or against it?
130765,They're definitely not ignoring it.  It's the same prominence as it's always been.
