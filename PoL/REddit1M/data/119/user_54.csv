57024,"The issue I have, personally, is that they (Nintendo) released their official timeline. They (Nintendo) stated they had a timeline in mind when they made most of the Zelda games.

Show me where Nintendo has said Mario has a timeline.

July 2010, with a quote from Aonuma

&gt;Yes there is a master timeline but its confidential document! The only people to have access to that document are myself, Mr. Miyamoto and the director of the title. We cant share it with anyone else! I have already talked to Mr. Miyamoto about this so I am comfortable in releasing this information – this title [Skyward Sword] takes place before Ocarina of Time. if I said that a certain title was ‘the first Zelda game’, then that means that we cant ever make a title that takes place before that! So for us to add titles to the series, we have to have a way of putting the titles before or after each other.

And even Miyamoto, who doesn't take the timeline into real consideration until well after the game is fun, says there was a document they used to follow along with where the stories were time wise.

Basically, they don't feel the story is as important as the 'fun' of the game, but they did have some sort of timeline well before Historia came out."
