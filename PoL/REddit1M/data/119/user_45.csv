45345,"&gt; Like I don't think that they set out to create a canon where the timeline splits when they were first developing ocarina of time.

Considering OoT has 2 specific endings that both show a different end result even beyond the point Link is send back from/too.  
it is hard to argue that the idea of both timelines continuing wasn't planned."

That is exactly how the timeline is tho..."

&gt; Trying to force a timeline on a series that was never really built with one in mind was...ill advised.

Ever singly game except four sword had an existing connection to atleast 1 previous game in the series.  

the only thing the historia ""forced"" was giving us names for eras and when the other major ""past"" events took place in relation to each other."
