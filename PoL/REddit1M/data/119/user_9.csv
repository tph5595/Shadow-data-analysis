11794,"The Temple of Time likely has been rebuilt over the years. As for Lon Lon Ranch, it likely was brought to ruins when Calamity Ganon brough ruins to the kingdom 100 years ago. Ganon was apparently stopped pretty efficiently according to the backstory of BotW, so might have not done any damage to the kingdom.

Lon Lon Ranch might have been running since OoT till 100 years ago.

12066,"The 10 000 years backstory is not describing the events of OoT.

The Zora backstory mentions that the Zora beast is named after Princess Ruto from OoT, and this beast was created even before the first appearance of Calamity Ganon 10 000 years ago. The Diary clearly mentions that Princess Ruto was from an age long before the 10 000 years old backstory.

Which means; 

**OoT's events** -&gt; Ages -&gt; **Beasts are created/First appearance of Calamity Ganon** &gt;- 10 000 years -&gt; **BotW's past** -&gt; 100 years -&gt; **Current BotW**"
13007,"I'm okay with some stories changing over time .... but if they decide to merge the Downfall timeline with the Dhild timeline (which would explain the first memory's mention of the Twilight as well as the massive amount of Downfall Timeline clues), I would be extremely disappointed.

While introducing ''The Hero of Time is defeated'' scenario did not make much sense and only seemed to be there in order to make the older games fit, now that it is there, I sure hope it stays for good.


I'm not saying this is exactly what happens here but I see this a possibility as people are stuck between those two placement .... And I just hope Aonuma would spill the damn beans already about this.

16791,"**The Divine beast Vah Ruta, built ages later to face off against Calamity Ganon, was named in honor of Ruto**

**When the divine beast Vah Ruta was discovered at Zora's domain, my daugther Mipha hurried to see it**

This seems to strongly imply that the beasts were named, as they should logically, when they were initially created more than 10 000 years ago.
