34877,"&gt; Yes, MM was a sequel because our ""Hero of Time"" wandered into a cursed forest and ended up without friends in a doomed world. He saves the world. Now what does that actually add to the Zelda lore? 

It actually adds a lot. Because if he didn't depart to Termina, chances are he never would've died and became the Heroes Shade. Therefore he never would've of taught TP Link the hidden skills. Thus TP Link would be significantly weaker.

&gt; The Legend of Zelda"" but that's where the Zelda connection ends until you meet Ganon.

No. Because of the direct results of OoT, this world exists. Without the connection of OoT, WW's world would not exist. They would not have an endless ocean, the zora would still be around, Hyrule would still be around. 

As you can see because of one event they are not.

37836,"To be honest, one of the main enjoyments I have with Zelda is the overarching timeline BS. It's fun just exploring the world and finding ruins and places that you know are from old Zelda games and placing the game on a certain spot in the timeline.

To get rid of this would really dampen my experience with the series. BoTW on a gameplay standpoint is great. It's fun, easy to master, and over the top. However. It isn't difficult enough to hold my interest and on the story side. Zelda has never truly been that original. And things can remain the same for so long. 

I think the plot (For an Open world game.) was done rather well. But It's still ""Save Zelda!"" And it's in Hyrule. The moment they branched out they made games infinitely better than anything in Hyrule (For the most part.) 

And they have mixed and matched timelines in Hyrule Warriors. And you could argue in BoTW too. However in this game it feels like they're here just because why the hell not and that's not exactly a good feeling. So I don't hope they stop using the timeline idea. Otherwise I won't be able to enjoy Zelda for much longer. Although I'm not sure why they can't use a convergence theory. Or even in one of areas where there's a very long pause between games. They can do whatever they want and it'll still be good.

So if they made timelines an afterthought and just toss in things for more of an easter egg than story reasons it wouldn't exactly have the same effect."
120254,"From the previous two main titles (BoTW and SS.) BoTW uses mainly of these areas as nothing more than nostalgic areas that vaguely resemble how we remember them. There is no plot significance, no incentive to side quest, not even a memorial or some type of confirmation this is the same place. 

They're just there. 


And SS while it does get a pass given that it was the first chronological game. It doesn't really have that appeal that other games such as WW, TP, or even the original Zelda game had.

They are good in their own right. But given how they keep reusing the same things such as the
""Save Zelda!""  plot and in Hyrule the series gets more stale overtime. So I feel like the timeline fixes that issue a bit. 

Get rid of that or just ignore it for a while and the game doesn't exactly resonate well with some.

Sacred Groves in TP. Clear reference to OoT Castle town, dungeon, portal to the past, an object of a race of the sky resides there. 

**It has plot relevance.** And it directly ties in with OoT and (Potentially SS. But that's a if.)

WW's Forest Haven and Forbidden Woods are the Lost Woods and Kokiri forest respectively. Not to mention there are vague outlines of the old  hyrule (Oot) if you zoom out from Hyrule Castle.

And by all technical means. Every game has rupees in the grass due to the minish. Which ties all Zelda games together in a sense.


Those are a few examples."
125517,"For. 

Ninty in the last few games seem to just ignore if for ""Originality."" And they have been slacking because of it on the story front. Which is one of Zelda's strong points."
