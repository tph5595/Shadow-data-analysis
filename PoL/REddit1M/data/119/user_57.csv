63293,"&gt;See any timeline talk before that?

Uh... yeah?  People have been arguing about the timeline since the late 90's.  There were entire sections of forums cordoned off for timeline arguments before the Historia hit.  If anything, timeline discussions actually died down after the Historia, since Nintendo blasted the canon cannon through all the crazy fan theories.  Prior to WW there wasn't too much to theorize about, since the only real wrinkles were conflicting quotes about whether LoZ or LttP came first and inconsistencies between LttP's backstory and OoT, but from WW up to the release of the Historia a lot of people got super deep into debating timeline possiblities.  The idea of split timelines was popularized long before the Historia by several developer interviews.  The only really surprising thing about the Historia's timeline was the third branch being a ""what if Link died"" scenario."
