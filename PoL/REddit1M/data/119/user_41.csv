41826,"It's been stated several times in this thread that the franchise always had a timeline. Since Zelda II. Aonuma even stated way before HH that OoT had two different endings, leading to different universes. "
41953,Where did they ever say the timeline doesn't matter? All they said is that it doesn't follow a strict rule set. They can change it however they want.
42855,"We're in Hyrule. That much gives us an idea where we are in the three timelines. I guess you could argue that the Great Sea somehow dried up and the Master Sword was restored from Ganondorf's skull, and we're in a post Spirit Tracks era. However, that seems unlikely. The timeline doesn't have to be extremely important, but there's still a difference between importance and irrelevance. 

The explanation for the inclusion of several WW races could be that their evolution was always the natural outcome, given time. Same with all the cross-universe place names. They can simply be references to other games, however they can still be explained in-game. Mikau for example could be a BotW era Zora and a MM one.
