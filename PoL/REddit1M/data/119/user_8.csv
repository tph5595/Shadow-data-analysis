10043,"Agreed, but I dislike that they made up this entire timeline nonsense just to hype Skyward Sword up. They've repeated countless times about Zelda, ""gameplay first, story second"", when will people get the message that they never cared about a timeline and just made games that are fun to play and experience.

Before BotW was even released, there were already videos on YouTube analyzing in which timeline the game took place. We knew nothing about the game back then. Get a life."

Sure, you can spin that in all kind of ways to say people enjoy things that weren't meant for enjoyment. At least you can say, within games you have to do/find x number of things towards completing the game.

Now back to ""analyzing Zelda lore"". They obviously just draft a story around the gameplay elements they create for a game. They put in some references to another Zelda game (wow, every game has a ""It's dangerous to go alone"" reference, that must make them all come after the original Zelda, timeline-wise! or was it just the first Zelda game ever released?) and create new versions of old characters. That isn't lore, that's trying to sell games and toys.

In terms of ""lore"". Skyward Sword is literally and figuratively the Star Wars prequels of Zelda. ""Hi, I'm Demise! See that sword you're holding? I just cursed it by lifting my finger so that every time a goddess farts, Ganondorf is reborn and the cycle of triforce fighting starts over again."" We didn't need that explanation, because it isn't an explanation. It removes my ability to imagine my own story around these characters because real lore is handled with real care, not as if it's just a cut and paste job.

Discussing the timeline is totally fine and I'm sorry if I offend anybody. I was only trying to say: Don't be the guy that starts speculating about the timeline placement of a game before we can even play it. That's just a pathetic way to farm views on your YouTube video. I only ended with my apology to get some more downvotes, see if I care, I'm totally not triggered :D"
29658,"&gt; majora's mask is the sequal to OOT and TP and WW story is heavily influenced by the actions of hero of time of OOT.

Yes, MM was a sequel because our ""Hero of Time"" wandered into a cursed forest and ended up without friends in a doomed world. He saves the world. Now what does that actually add to the Zelda lore? Aside from being a side-story? I'm really curious. The lore you speak of is very fragile to say the least. WW is the same, they start of with a narration of ""Last time on The Legend of Zelda"" but that's where the Zelda connection ends until you meet Ganon."
