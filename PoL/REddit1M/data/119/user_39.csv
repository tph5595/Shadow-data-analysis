You don't need to play any of those games to understand what is going on because they're self sufficient games but that doesn't mean the elements connecting the games don't exist, and they are very obvious sequels. It matters, if not, why would Nintendo have made an obvious sequel? Seriously. I know most of the time there will only be references and that's fine, but that doesn't mean it holds no impact. 

Moreover I was saying the story in a single game is more elaborated than Mario's even if it is simple. And yes it matters to have a little bit of story at least, in a the single game that you're playing. Imagine if Ocarina of time was removed of all its story and Majora's Mask was the same? It wouldn't be the same game at all. Or if BotW was just : save the Princess and you had no memories or any cutscenes, would that be fine? There would literally be nothing else but exploration. I care about those. Skyward Sword also had a story and they even went out of their way to made some sort of beginning to the legend."
