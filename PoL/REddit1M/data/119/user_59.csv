That's why I'm kind of hopeful that if they're really doing a 'soft reboot' they treat continuity/canon with more attention this time around. Or even plan for cool twists, come on! It's more than proven that us Zelda fans love the story."
64604,Good points. I think they have an opportunity on their hands however to make an attempt at gaming's first Tolkien-esque story starting with BoTW. Or maybe that already exists. I'm not very hardcore.
