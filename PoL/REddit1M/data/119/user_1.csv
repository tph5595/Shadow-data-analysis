4160,"To my understanding didn't they only create an overarching history to the games only because the fans wanted it? Like I don't think that they set out to create a canon where the timeline splits when they were first developing ocarina of time. 

In terms of this game I didn't really think it fit anywhere with the traditional three pronged model. Forgot the canon guys it's a good game regardless of where it fits in some arbitrary order."
4895,"I will say though that one minor reason I'm sad that the game stands alone is that the soundtrack doesn't really borrow any themes from any of the previous games. There's a bit of it in the Rito place referencing the Dragon Roost tune from Wind Waker but on its own the soundtrack is meh.

Like it's not bad at all but like it's nowhere near ocarina or wind waker levels.

Edit: Yeah I've realized that I should listen closer. Understood"
5739,"I agree with what your saying that it could be any timeline. However your comment begs me to bring up an ancillary point about the plot of the game. So if  I understand correctly, Zelda, Link and all the champions went to take on Ganon but they got their ass handed to them. And just as Link was about to die Zelda puts him to sleep and somehow saves him and he wakes up 100 years later in a cave meanwhile she's still stuck all that time in Hyrule Castle? Lol wtf logic is that?"
6133,K so don't spoil what they are but am I to understand that there are multiple endings? I haven't beaten the game mind you so don't ruin it for me. Also what's this talk about DLC? will it be an expansion to the main story or what exactly?
