37854,"But... by playing the game YOU make it canon. Everything you do in the game is what is told when someone by a campfire tells ""The Legend of Zelda""

Just because you played Breath of the Wild, and make that ""Legend of Zelda"" it doesn't invalidate the canon you also created on your playthrough of ""The Wand of Gamelon""."
38533,"One thing: There's nothing preventing previous games/stories from happening between the Calamity Ganon of 10,000 years ago, and the one from 100 years ago. Zelda is not an infallible narrator, she can very well be correct in everything she is talking about when referring to the Sheikah artifacts that she's gleamed from her research, but there could very well be artifacts, stories, etc that happened 1,000, 2,000, etc years ago that faded away into history. Maybe ""Calamity"" form only happens every 10,000 years like a limit break when he's SO ANGRY that is improbably hot Ganondorf form is killed for the Xth time.


There's so much to work with. The story is so malleable and it's pretty exciting to me, to find things like map comparisons and references buried away that tickle my brain and make me wonder ""What if...?""


What I'm trying to say is that Link: The Faces of Evil totally happened, you guys."
38772,"I am having trouble understanding how things would suddenly not matter? I enjoy a lot of Time Travel type fiction. So by the entire nature of the genre things are becoming undone and redone etc. But they still happened? It's hard for me to articulate, I guess."
38919,"Wait. Are you trying to tell me that Mario Kart, Super Mario Bros, and Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympics don't take place in a unified timeline????"
39541,"Yeah, exactly that! That's where I'm coming from on this. :)"
39965,"Man I hate that timeline, they only created it to fit Luigi's Mansion into the canon."
116726,"But aren't her journals based off of the information she got from the control stones? Maybe her info is referring to Calamity Ganon form specifically, and the Gannondorf resurrections didn't get as meticulously recorded. "
117104,"Same way he gets out every other time. Some wizard casts a spell, a trans-dimensional lady lusts for link so bad her soul splits in two, y' know. The usual."
117851,"Yeah, joking about Hyrule Warriors aside; Agahnim did it, the Twinrova did it, etc. Apparently the dude just needs the door opened just a tiny bit for him to get out in some way or another."
