34335,"Eh, I like any game I play to have its events be solidly canon. I don't play Zelda to live a legend, I play it to save a kingdom in what I would only hope is ""real time"" with their current events. Rather than playing something based on an old tale, I want to play something happening in the present of their universe. I want all lore in the game to be accurate to the world, and not shrouded behind myth. I hope they don't start taking that approach."
34456,"How did King Daphnes stay alive for more than a hundred years without aging when Hyrule was burried?

Goddess magic. Goddess magic is like anti-aging cream that works."

38042,"That's nice and all, but AoL was officially stated to be a sequel to TLoZ. ALttP was official stated to be a prequel to TLoZ. OoT was officially stated to be a prequel to ALttP. There was already a competent shared history before the stupid timeline shenanigans, and I liked that. I liked the thought of a series that has legitimate background history that isn't necessarily limiting to future titles. You can play all of the titles I mentioned without playing anything else before hand and nothing will be lost, but knowing previous history only enriches the experience of those titles.

The only thing that I don't like is the fanbase trying to tell the Zelda devs that everything needs a place in the timeline. Things like FSA and other spin-off titles should pretty much just be considered fun games with no connection to anything.

I like seeing returning story elements and having them matter in a symbolic way. I like the idea of Hyrule having its own shared history of destruction, but the timeline business was wack. I like that the shared history brought us a great story in Skyward Sword, but I don't like the constant back and forth in the fanbase."
38276,"You say that like Zelda games are choice based RPGs. What you said makes sense in regards to TES, but not Zelda.

Like I said though. I don't want my playthrough to be relegated to a campfire story with inconsistencies. I want my ""Legend of Zelda"" to be happening at the present point in the history of whatever world the games take place in. I want it to matter. I hate when games retcon things."
39318,"Oh, you mean like a Dragon Break? Where alternate realities are created by choices, but then they all merge together, causing history to be contradictory on the events that took place?

I thought you meant that the games we play are all just myths centered around a basic truth, rather than playing the game during the time its actually happening, so what we see and do IS the truth."
39634,"Ah, okay. I'm on the same page now then!"
57866,"That's common though. A lot of game series where every game fits into a chronological history has lore inconsistencies like this. Look at Fallout and TES. It's just the nature of gameplay coming before narrative. Everything is shaped around the gameplay, because it matters most. That doesn't mean the devs don't want to make an enticing shared narrative, it just means that it's always the last part, and sometimes inconsistencies arise from that. 

For me, Zelda will always be a series with a timeline. A legend of a civilization wrought by constant conflict brought on by an ancient curse. Breath of the Wild is the ""modern day"" event in the timeline. The point where all of the legends, the past history of Hyrule all long fogotten, surface once more."
58099,Seems more like they're just retconning things to make a more concise and less convoluted history for Hyrule.
