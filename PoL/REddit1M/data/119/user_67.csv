Zelda as a series is obviously not connected in a traditional sense, but I still do believe that there is a lot to look into. It's the ambiguity of everything that makes it so much fun. Each game isn't totally connected to every other game, but the threads do exist. It's because of this subtle framework that makes it so much fun to ask ""so if A exists here, and A also exists later on here but slightly altered, what could have happened to make that so?""

There absolutely is lore and story-depth in Zelda, and I think it's incorrect to claim otherwise. Zelda just delivers it a different way; it gives your brain a little bit of material to work with then  it lets your imagination piece together this grand legend that stretches over millennia. That's what this entire series is about: imagination. It was founded on Miamoto's imagination from when he explored the outdoors as a kid, and, when the first game came out, it used imagination to get past the NES's limitations and recreate that sense of adventure.

Now, of course, you can play through the games as individual units and say ""cool, that game was fun to play,"" and I'm totally cool with that. I've just always had a lot more fun looking deep into the games to challenge my mind and connect them all and seeing the messages like ""loss and letting go of the past"" from Wind Waker, ""grief and suffering"" from Majora's Mask, ""the rise to adulthood"" in Ocarina of Time, ""the defiance of fate"" in Skyward Sword, and so on. At that point it becomes more than just ""Princess and Hyrule in trouble, go save pls for the 19th time + fun gameplay,"" and I've always gained much more enjoyment by seeing it as more than that."
