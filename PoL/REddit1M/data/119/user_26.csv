31960,"He'll leave it to our imagination?  That just made my morning.  Some games went together and others referenced other games, but that's IT.  The time line was for SS and the Hyrule historia.  It's a convention made for people who keep asking questions, not a creative tool.  Zelda is not about deep continuity at all...   They never used it before that except very very loosely for things like WW and it certainly wasn't a fleshed out concept.   

Downvote me all you want I'm right.  The timeline came about because people couldn't shut up and just fill in the blanks themselves.   SS sucked because it focused on it's place in the timeline as opposed to being a good Zelda title."
80704,Nope I'm good you seem pretty rooted in the timeline.
