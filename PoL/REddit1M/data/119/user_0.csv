0,"""Fujibayashi and Aonuma also took on a question regarding where Breath of the Wild’s story is positioned in the history of Hyrule. Fujibayashi said that he’ll leave it to our imagination. Aonuma explained things a bit more, stating that Hyrule’s history has changed with time, and even now there are some occasions of canon histories becoming slightly changed. Some detailed parts in the history books have been changed as well. What’s being said here is that even history books used in schools have changed, so why not Hyrule? Aonuma also joked about how that’s why this time the situation becomes like finding a new ancient document.""

It's vague... somewhat, for arguments sake I guess... but with everything they've said before it's pretty obvious. 

If it's for fun that's awesome, but I'm still seeing quite a bit of arguing on here. If they can grow, break conventions of the franchise, then we can grow as a community too."

4532,"yeah that's how I saw it. with all of the references from all the games everyone loved, it was amazing and im still finding really rad things, myself, and from other users. I'd like to see more discussion than bashing someone because of ""timeline"" debates.  "
4950,"I'd be game for that. I've always loved Aonuma and his hand in how Zelda has evolved, and he's stated he makes games he loves so restricting that to ""this has to fit here"" would have a negative outcome in the long run. "
5324,"I thought that too, but as I play with headphones on, relaxing... the sense of ""I'm out here, exploring..."" listening for that faint 'korok' windmill chime sound, etc... as I do get to areas with music, Heteno, etc, they hit really nice. 

Also, there's a video on YouTube where someone adds all the music in from the other games in the appropriate areas...and it COMPLETELY changes the game and I found myself really happy with the decision they made. if they choose to add more dungeons with some great soundtracks too and compromise a bit, that would be awesome as well.  "
5420,"lol, you're prob right. "
5532,"that's a cool look on it. I do remember reading something along the lines of ""since Ganon keeps destroying things, technology can't advance, hyrule is always in this medieval time state and that's why the games share that theme."" 

I think that opinion and yours can really explain why 10000 years later it's still a perfect zelda game with the atmosphere we all know and love. "
42606,"exactly, they're not getting rid of the history or lore but being able to branch out from those awesome stories as they please in these new games. I love seeing ruins from all the games in this story, they made the right move. "
63134,"not having precise places to place games or base the story off of tho won't take away any epicness. this was the most epic game due to the fact it combined so many things from every game, why would u want to cut that down to 1/3 of what it is? "
