25349,"Now that's just unnecessarily condescending, why would you care about how people approach and discuss a piece of entertaining media like they want to in their spare time? By the same logic just playing a video game is a complete waste of time. People don't do it because it's meaningful, people do it because they find the process of reading, analyzing and puzzling together lore entertaining and find joy in it. Doesn't have to be your cup of tea but it also doesn't have to be your problem"
31248,"&gt;No it's actually quite different from the enjoyment of playing a video game. They make a video game for you to have fun. Sure, you can spin that in all kind of ways to say people enjoy things that weren't meant for enjoyment. At least you can say, within games you have to do/find x number of things towards completing the game. 

Just because you can quantify it easier doesn't mean it's a ""more legitimate"" way of having fun.

&gt;Now back to ""analyzing Zelda lore"". They obviously just draft a story around the gameplay elements they create for a game. 

I don't think there are many games of the scope of 3D Zeldas or beyond that were developed the other way around. You don't write a story and then come up with a sprawling game around it, it's usually done by deciding on rough central themes early on and figuring out the concrete stuff as you go along. For example, the Dark Souls series is (famously) very centralized towards its gameplay, yet has really extensive lore to explore (far deeper than anything TLOZ games are trying to accomplish) with a couple of glaring plot holes here and there. Does that mean people are not supposed to discuss and theorycraft to fill the plot holes because of some arbitrary decision that the devs didn't intend you to? Are they not allowed to interconnect each Dark Souls game because all references to previous titles are deemed fanservice?

&gt;Don't be the guy that starts speculating about the timeline placement of a game before we can even play it. That's just a pathetic way to farm views on your YouTube video. 

If someone makes a video carefully explaining their speculations and expections of the possible overarching lore of a game based on promotional material, that's not them pathetically farming views, that's them being excited and translating their anticipation into something as productive as conveying their thoughts and creating a piece of media that inspires other people and gets *them* excited. Even the process of formulating ideas, compiling them into a single continuous piece of work and putting oneself out there is enjoyable on its own for many people. For some, it's even a vantage to practice their rhetorics or their editing skills or (at least some aspect of) stage fright in a context they feel comfortable with. And even if I *didn't* like discussing the timeline stuff of zelda games, I wouldn't think ""what a pathetic waste of time"", I would think ""good for you"" and move on with whatever I'm doing.

No offense, but frankly the only one wasting their time and resources here is you trying to tell people what they're supposed to enjoy doing and what not."
