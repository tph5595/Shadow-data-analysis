56725,"&gt; OoT was officially stated to be a prequel to ALttP. There was already a competent shared history before the stupid timeline shenanigans, and I liked that.

Even before they started breaking things into multiple timelines, there was some weirdness with continuity between the games. Ocarina of Time seemed to be the series' ""origin story"" on its face, but it also contradicted the other games' established backstories in weird ways. 

OoT loosely portrays the events in ALttP's backstory, with Ganondorf being sealed in the Sacred Realm, but there's no real ""imprisoning war"" and the knights of hyrule are nowhere to be seen. And then there's the fact that OoT has a Zelda, yet the Zelda from AoL was supposedly the reason that all princesses are named Zelda. Was she asleep since before OoT, back when the Triforce was sealed in the Sacred Realm? Why did no one use it to wake her up back then? 

The reality is that the plots of Zelda games have *always* been treated as legends. The timeline stuff made things more complicated, but that was really just a creative way to continue doing what they always had been doing, which was to vaguely reference the previous games without strongly tying themselves down to a shared history.

57577,"I broadly agree with what you're saying (even though I do find the Zelda timeline interesting), but...

&gt; And yet, no one is struggling to link Mario Odyssey to Galaxy and the Mario and Luigi series and which timeline Mario RPG is part of.

[I beg to differ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGTddc62fXc). Fans will create theories and backstories out of *anything*."
