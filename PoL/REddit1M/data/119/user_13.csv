21828,Why is this a problem? and how having a timeline hurts gameplay?

And if they just made the game without thinking about timeline placement in the first place then you may be right, but they made adventures of link as the sequal to the original LOZ, and they made LTTP as the prequal of LOZ, same as OOT being the prequal of LTTP, majora's mask is the sequal to OOT and TP and WW story is heavily influenced by the actions of hero of time of OOT.

PH and ST both made to be the sequal to WW and show what happend to tetra and link after they went out to search for a new land. 

SS is the prequal to the story as a whole

More games in the series were made with a more or less clear timeline than the ones that don't give the player a connection to the whole story (minish cup and the FS ones gives you their own ""side story"" and then you have the oracle games that don't have clear placement)

and even BOTW gives us a really clear placement with no much room of thinking as to where this game falls in the timeline.

TLDR: saying that the devs don't have a timeline in mind is just not true, they may pull BOTW everytime and throw the game in a distant future but thats still says that they have timeline in their mind, they are just gonna be flexible about it"
32976,"the LEGEND of zelda is like its name, a legend, the legend of the various heroes and their heroic deeds against evil. each entry of the games tell you the story of the hero that saves hyrule/other kingdoms in need. 

you can play each game in any order you want and how you want, but each game is connected to another game and reference said game and creates the whole story of the series.

i really don't understand why you are so aggresive toward the idea of a lore anyway, you sound like those genwunners that says that EV training and IV breeding ruins the game, you can be interested in it, you can ignore it, doesn't change the game at all"
