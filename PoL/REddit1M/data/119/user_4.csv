5157,"I think the '10,000 years' before the beginning of the game's story(before Link goes unconscious) is indicative of sort of a soft reboot. I know, I know. That doesn't make any sense, but I use 'reboot' in a loose sense here.

It reminds me of KOTOR, and how that game takes place 4,000 years before the Star Wars movies. It takes place that far back so that the writers had total freedom with the story without having to pay much attention to continuity. I think the same thing has been done here with BotW, but more in a way that effectively discards continuity. 

I think BotW takes place so far into the future, that literally any timeline can exist in the past, and it's up to the player to decide which one existed, if any of them did at all. 10,000 years before BotW could be Ganon's last appearance in each timeline(which could be the original LoZ, Four Swords Adventure, or Wind Waker), or perhaps even something else entirely, for those new to the series. But no matter what happened, its 10,000 years before BotW. This was done so that BotW could be literally anything Nintendo/Aonuma wanted it to be. "
