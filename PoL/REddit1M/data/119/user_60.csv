67373,"I could make a hundred rants about this. If the timelines rejoined, wouldn't there be some MASSIVE legends about that? Suddenly there's three times more people, a bunch of buildings, weird terrain, water everywhere, everything would break! Plus, what would cause such an event? And furthermore, why from both an in-universe and game development standpoint would any of that happen?

Also I'm salty because Wind Waker's story is perfect and this ruins it fight me"
67889,"Thank the Goddess. Now we can get back to drawing connections, theorizing, and just loving and enjoying *each* game for what it is.

 I was honestly disappointed when after the first teaser for Breath of the Wild (back when it was just ""The Legend of Zelda"") and everyone was trying to draw timeline connections instead of talking about how the technology would fit the tone of the game, the art style they chose, gameplay bits they wanted to return or new ones they imagined...

 Next time a Zelda gets teased I hope that we can use this statement and move past the series's ""lore"". I love Zelda games for their gameplay, the High Fantasy setting, and the tonal similarities between games, not because I can read an in-game history book that tells about how the Hero of Men from Minish Cap affects history leading to A Link to the Past like many high fantasy RPGs would.

Also, I have no problems with Skyward Sword's story (game was meh), because nobody needs to know it in order to enjoy the other games. Nothing that happens in it would be completely alien to the uninitiated, which is excellent. The whole game is basically frosting on my Voltfruit Pie.

In other words, Zelda will stay exactly the same tonally (e.g. not getting more lore-heavy) but move forward in other aspects. HUZZAH!"
67916,Finally someone else who sees that that theory is ridiculous
80111,"There doesn't have to be a timeline. It's like when people saw the Triforce in Ikana Valley and thought ""How could they have known about that?"" Stuff like that."
80202,How can you not be aware that an ocean is suddenly missing? 
81117,"I never said games can't come cronologically. Majora's Mask makes no sense without its prequel, and Minish Cap without Four Swords as its sequel. With no support for a timeline for EVERY game, fans can speculate which MIGHT be connected to their hearts' desires."
81196,"I just think that almost any other idea is more satisfying, makes more sense, whatever. This is the only theory for anything I've ever unconditionally hated.

(Actually that sans is Ness thing was also trash)"
82135,"It's the WORST. Earthbound is probably my second favorite Nintendo IP, so trying to find community activity buried in furry trash is awful. I liked UT but ugh I'm so sick of it and its cancer fans"
83630,"Yeah I'd really recommend it. Don't bother playing through it more than about twice, though. Gets stale."
