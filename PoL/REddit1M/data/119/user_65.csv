76755,"The convergence theory is similar to the concept of the ""Dragon Break"" in The Elder Scrolls.

The idea formed back in TESII:Daggerfall, pretty much Bethesda wanted to have multiple endings but didn't want to invalidate the outcomes of them. Despite the two endings being wildly different they found a way to make them both Canon. So they created the ""Dragon Break"", I won't go into specifics but basically the concept means that eventually time ""fixed itself"".

To answer your questions, no there wouldn't be any legends about it because no one would even be aware it happened. To the perspective of the average person in Hyrule they would be no different. The example within TES is one person may remember this happening, but another may remember this, another person may remember both and be confused.

A converged timeline isn't some massive ""event"", it'll be the slow merging of information and legend into a singular world. Besides the easiest way to explain how would be the Triforce, either through a wish or even the Godess of Time trying to bring the world back together. BotW is far into the future of whatever timeline it's in.

Anyway, I'm almost convinced it's the Child Timeline anyway. I'm just not opposed to the convergence theory, it makes sense once you wrap your head around it."

Who knows though, maybe they just aren't because magic."
81752,"Well as you can probably tell, I don't have any problems with the theory. It makes some sense but has it's holes.

I'm pretty certain it's adult anyway.

I never played Undertale and I'm certain at least half it's fans probably don't even know who Ness is anyway."

Undertale has a cancerous fandom, much like FNAF.

When (if) I ever play Undertale I'll make sure I steer clear of the fandom, I've heard only good things about the game so at least there's that."
