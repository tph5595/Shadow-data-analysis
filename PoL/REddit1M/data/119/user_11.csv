Most fans simply read too much into it. But basically, since *Link to the Past*, Nintendo has been hitting the reset switch when necessary. And that's okay, no one Zelda really depends on the other to justify itself, even as some lean a bit on others (eg *Wind Waker*'s stained glass reference to *Ocarina of Time*). And it opens up new interpretations of what would otherwise be the same o'l story. We benefit from the creativity of not rigidly adhering to an arbitrary timeline. 

Heaven help us if anyone demands a coherent timeline of Mario. Most gamers are content to just enjoy the games without overthinking it."

And Calamity still had the same Ganondorf theme. The old tunes are everywhere, except this time, with a full orchestral score. As a long time Zelda fan, I've been loving it."

Any sense of a link was certainly dead by the time OoT came out. It's more like James Bond at this point -- sometimes there are sequels, but usually, it's just retellings. Of course, even Bond fans have come up with strained rationales like ""007 and James Bond are just code names used by different agents."" The real answer is ""the studio wants to keep using the same premise because customers are willing to pay for it.""

In any case, any sense of a consistent timeline in Zelda was abandoned twenty years before this post was created."

All the Zelda games strung together, and the strained logic of the 'official' timeline, and how BotW doesn't fit at all.

When they made *Wind Waker* -- which is much more closely connected to OoT than any of the other Zeldas, and clearly ends the tale of Hyrule insofar as Link and Zelda leave it and the Master Sword behind, and thus, *Link to the Past* and the original NES titles couldn't possibly take place afterwards -- do you believe Nintendo was secretly withholding the fact that ""oh, there's THREE branching timelines, and we just won't reveal it for the next 8 years""? The truth is, they never bothered to conceive of this silliness until they went about publishing the Hyrule Historia, and had to figure it all out well after the fact.

They've been making it all up as they go along. It's okay. There was no grand Zelda vision set out 40 years ago, that somehow all these new Zelda games are built in accordance to. They come up with a concept they want to explore, and then build a new story around it. Whether or not it fits a timeline with any consistency is mostly irrelevant to the development of any given Zelda title. They'll always retcon or outright not think through certain connections that they feel suit the current title, regardless of how it screws up the timeline because *they don't care that much.* Nor should they, it would only constrain them creatively. We get better games for it.
