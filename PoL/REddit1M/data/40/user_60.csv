26907,There should be an app called Daily Log on your Wii U menu. You don't get a lot of info on the TV screen but the Gamepad will let you view total play time within a month. So you can look at March and see how many hours you've played BOTW. 
27255,"Does the Master Sword have to completely run out of energy before it will recharge? I unequipped it when it said it was ""low on energy"" and after like 15 hours of play time it hasn't recharged. It's still flashing red in my inventory like a damaged weapon. Is it not recharging because it isn't completely out of energy?

Not everyone would do it, but you could get more rupees if you're willing to spend the time to offload certain things in specific places. "
27768,Well poop. It seemed like it shouldn't take so long to recharge but I was afraid to use it all the way down for some reason. 
28928,Damn. It said it was -54F where I left the horse. I'm a terrible person.
