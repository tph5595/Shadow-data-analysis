47599,Don't bother buying ancient cores. Get some Ancient Arrows and kill guardians (walkers or fliers) with them and they'll drop often.

Oddly enough, I only had the rubber trousers, and after selling it the Tarrey Town merchant sold me the whole set. Score."

Headshot them with arrows to disorient them, then you can mount them and deal 5 hits (use a double handed weapon). If you jump at the right time (perfect guard) you'll get to flurry rush them. This is really the only way to beat them. They drop some majorly over-powered loot. You will be farming them later in your quest for sport and upgrades.

Keep some meat skewers and fairies while you practice. After a while you can flawless-victory them."
