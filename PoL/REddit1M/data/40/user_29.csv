9663,"sorry if this sounds stupid but how do you tame a horse? i've been able to tame the spotted ones with no problems but the solid color ones are giving me trouble. i haven't gotten any stamina upgrades yet, if that helps- i always run out of stamina before i can soothe them. do i just press L rapidly or press and hold it or what? TIA"
