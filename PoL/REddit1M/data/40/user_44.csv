If you unequip all items that have the electricity indicator on them (weapon, shield, and bow) you won't be struck. "

I swear I tried this once at the beginning of the game and nothing happened, so I've just been ignoring those statues ever since. I guess I need to go back and find them all!"

Have you been able to successfully soothe regular horses? You're hitting the left shoulder button and not the trigger, right? "
19782,"Yep, that's your problem. You want to be hitting the ""activate rune"" button, not the ""shield"" button.

On the Wii U at least, Nintendo calls the shoulder/bumpers ""L"" and ""R"" while the triggers are ""ZL"" and ""ZR"". So when the game says ""press L"" it means the bumper. I assume the button names are similar on the Switch. 

To be honest, I think the Xbox's bumper/trigger distinction (RB vs RT) is a lot clearer. ZL/ZR don't make sense unless you remember that the trigger on the N64 controller was Z."
