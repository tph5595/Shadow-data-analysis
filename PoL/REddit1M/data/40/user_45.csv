18522,hm i do have one stamina upgrade but I haven't had any trouble with the solid color horses. I do have full sheikah armor on but you don't seem to be having trouble with getting on them anyway right? just make sure to cook some stamina enhancing food and eat it right before your stamina wheel runs out. i usually just need to refill stamina once and i'm good. apples + courser bee honey makes good stamina food!
