16847,"I've seen some say there's a rhythm, others say just mash... have you tried using stamina food?"
18319,"OH! I thought it meant metal and can get struck by lightning, thanks!"
18377,Look around and see if there's a different kind of statue near you. I found one that took durians
18468,I believe there's a quest to take a pic of him too fyi
18955,Dye questions. Taking suggestions for color schemes for my extra Wind and Twilight outfits :)
19083,"LOL! Maybe, L (shoulder), not ZL (trigger) is the one you need to hit"
19096,that's what I was thinking then! 
25390,"AMIIBOOOOOOOOO!

Here I thought I had an idea for duplicates of my Time outfit and make the blue and red tunics :("
25494,Comment later this afternoon and I can check my guide to confirm/deny that for you :)
89274,Buy them a drink
89405,Find a shrine map online and just start visually scanning your map in comparison to it.
89439,Which shrine was that?
89621,"If you have amiibos, the Wind Waker ones drop fish too..."
90078,"I've gotten 2 sets of the Wind and Twilight outfits, I've got the hero outfit and almost a full time one. Got 2 shiek masks and the WW boomerang twice. Haven't seen Gannondorf's sword, Zelda's bow or the Hero Sword yet.

Do em all daily (Zelda series and Zelda figures from Smash series), that's 14 amiibos that'll drop rupees, arrows (all varieties), weapons, bows, shields, fish, meats, herbs and fruits. The Smash link will keep dropping goods after Epona has been claimed. I've only tried Wolf Link once since I assume it only spawns him and not drop other goods
"
90116,Depends on the item. Wind Waker and Twilight outfit pieces won't stop dropping lol
90201,Were arrows and bombs not limited? I've not played it since I cleared it
90209,Easily. I miss that system. Zelda and Metroid did that well
90277,"The Spinner, come on the name is so awful it's impossible to forget! ;)

But yes, Hookshot or Double Clawshot would be a dream"
90421,"I spent a long time trying to think of a witty response to that but nothing I came up with topped yours. Bravo!

Edit: but honestly, I've actually not even seen a bear in game yet... I have seen a rhino, and now I wonder lol"
133792,"oh right, I liked the game... Struggled with that hidden bridge in the fire temple, finding one maimai (bottom left, on a ledge you got to it by wallwalking) and figuring out step 3 for gannon (firing arrows backwards across the wall lol"
133805,Oh don't think I did that one
