19120,"Speaking of chu-chu's, do you have any idea how to make yellow chu jelly other than shooting it with a shock arrow? i found a neat way to do it and made like 10 of them and now I don't remember. "
21899,"I mean, I haven't done a number of things but you can still talk about them. I haven't played Skyward Sword either, I'm assuming the parts you're talking about are the ancient technology parts? Since Skyward Sword involves the advanced cloud society Hylians?  
  
Otherwise i pose his same question, which elements are you talking about. Like if i said, ""wow this game incorporates elements of wind waker"" and someone said I've never played that, I would respond ""The koroks!"" for instance. And they learn something new and have a reason to check out that game. "
