9485,"Any tips for catching horses? I haven't been able to finish either the Big Horse or White Horse sidequest. I can get on them just fine (equip Sheikah armor, crouch, sneak up behind), and have three full stamina wheels.

I'm hammering L as fast as I can when I get on, but I don't see any sign of progress (even if I extend my stamina a couple of times). Is there a specific timing/rhythm I should use?"

18701,I've used enough stamina food to go through about 20 wheels total. I think /u/swissarmychris is on the right track; I've probably used the wrong button.

Skipped the WiiU and never owned an N64, so I was equating this with the Gamecube controller. That'll do the trick."

Thanks for your help. I'll stop checking this account now, as it's a throwaway I created to hide my shame over such a simple thing."
