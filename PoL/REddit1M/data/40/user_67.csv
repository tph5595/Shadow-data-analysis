37653,"Same here. I always thought I woukd really like motion controls when nintendo finally went all-out with them.

Realized very quickly I just hate motion controls. Skyward sword is the only main zelda I didn't beat. I watched all the cutscenes online. "

49223,"True, but a spinner rune could have been a permanent shield surf item.

Much like we already have climbing but a hookshot could get you higher faster.

And like how in the game we have the ability to make updrafts from flames and then later get the jumping power. 

It's not needed to progress the game, but would really give a sense of progression. "

There are 50 different animals but like 10 enemy types. "
