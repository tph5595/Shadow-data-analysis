Is the star fragment item still there unmarked or has it despawned? How important are star fragments? Does the shooting star event only occur rarely?"

It often reminds me of Dark Souls - obviously it's not as nail bitingly hard, but there is little hand holding and the open world feels fluid and has a great sense of exploration."
