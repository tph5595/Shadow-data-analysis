A nice thing is that he has true infinite endurance (it instantly replenish upon use), but he immediately despawn as soon as you unmount it.

65612,"you'll need 30 topaz for the rubber set, 15 ruby for the rito outfit, 45 opals for the zora set, 90 amber for the hylian set ans 15 sapphire for the desert voe outfit. Diamond are used if you wanna reforge unique weapons, but they can sometimes be bough 5500 instead of 5000 (edit : for 10 of thoses) by the gerudo lady in the goron village.

also you''l need  22 of each if you ever wanna fully upgrade jeweries (47 for the opal earrings and 63 for the amber earrings)

You'll need a whole lot of luminous stones to buy and upgrade the luchador set, and then you can exchange 10 of them for a diamond in the zora domain

The rest you can sell"

Keep the rare ancien materials (gears, shafts, small and big cores). Screws and springs are easy to come by, but keep in mind you'll need some to buy stuff from the Akkala laboratory"
