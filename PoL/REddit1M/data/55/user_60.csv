14386,One of my favorite games even with these controls. But they were a hassle. Zelda needs to be played with a controller.
14737,I felt different about it. Only things that really bothered me was Fi and the motion controls. The art style really kept me interested. I enjoyed just exploring in the watercolory world.
16130,I know.  You would find something out and she would just reword and repeat it every time. It was awful. The game tried to hold your hand too hard.
