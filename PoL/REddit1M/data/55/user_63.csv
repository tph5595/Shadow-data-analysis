Unless you think someone who thinks ""beating a bunch of dudes to open a door"" is a good puzzle, is right.  

he made some good points but 9/10th of the video is spend getting distracted, making comments that work against each other and just showing how little he actually understands about the game."
19101,"&gt; The 3D aspect of Ocarina of Time did introduce a lot of issues, which they solved with Z-Targeting, which was brilliant, but it does actually cause the disconnect he talks about. How many 3D games have used Z-targeting since then? That's pretty good evidence that it wasn't a fantastic idea, although honestly it was brilliant for its time.

Almost every 3D action adventure game has a lock on in it, Bayonetta for example.  

&gt;He never mentions that beating a bunch of dudes till a door opens is even a puzzle, that was him talking about how intense sudden combat is engaging. But looking around for an eye to shoot isn't engaging. The former is satisfying, and the simple puzzles of ""find the thing in the room you have to look at before the door opens"" is not satisfying.  

Arin also decided to completely ignore the ACTUAL PUZZLES in Oot, and said that the eye/crystal things were bad puzzles for progressing, he then compared those things to beating a bunch of dudes, neither of the two are good examples of 'puzzles' like his original 'theme' for that part is supposed to be.  
(then again you can't expect anyone to have a good 'flow' in his script if it was written over the course of 3 years by someone that didn't even do his research completely)  

&gt;Then he talks about how OoT handles suspense and item chests, and I will admit that's a pretty minor point, but his points about suspense and creating a dungeon narrative? Those are all 100% valid.  

They are also filled with how a spoiled 3 year old would reaosn : ""WAH I don't WANT to WAIT, I SHOULD BE EXITED, not link, **I**""  
It is also an exceptionally moot point, and completely based on preference.  
LOTS of people like the chest opening animations.  

Also : a LOT of the points he made about what other games did well, were also done well by SS.  
Arin is just incapable of accepting SS did something good.  

SS didn't ""give it his all"" ?  
OW yeah, adding an entirely new mechanic to swordfighting isn't special at all.  
Being the first zelda with a crafting and upgrading option, and with an actual USE for money, isn't 'something' at all  

INFACT he talks about how ALBW gives 'value' to the rupees  
Yet he completely disregards the fact that SS did that before ALBW, and BETTER.  

Not to mention how it is pretty obvious that Arin lives in the past, and is completely incapable of accepting the video game 'market' and 'community' has GROWN and CHANGED in the meantime.  
Have you SEEN his WW playthough BTW ?  
Honestly, it makes everything so fucking clear.  

The disconnect between exploration and combat isn't an issue, its an issue HE has.  
Sliding hockey pucks ""out of nowhere"" that any normal person would be keeping an eye out of since you can SEE the pucks when entering the rooms with them in (in fact every single room with those things in is designed in such a way that you can see their path before entering it)  

Arin is just incapable of PAYING ATTENTION to games, to LISTEN to them.  
everything needs to be a simple 2 button control scheme for him, cause else he gets confused.  
HELL, he sucks so bad at paying attention to shit, he STILL didn't know how to parry decently in WW by the time he reached the fucking wind temple.

63082,"Jep, Arin thinks that anything that is different from the old games is automatically a flaw.  
And his total disregard for any storyline/character development shows how little he actually understands about the series."
63409,"It's funny how the sequilitis shot itself in the foot, while that playthrough made sure to shoot the other foot clean off.  
after seeing the total incompetence Arin displayed in that game, I'd say it is hard to really take stuff he says about the series serious.  

I especially loved the part where he starts saying WW is 'hard'  

Like... for fucking real ?  
WW is by far one of the easiest, of not THE easiest zelda game out there."
66015,"Jep, he also acts like OoT isn't allowed to be criticized or something, which hasn't been true for AGES by now.  
in fact, by now it has gotten as much, if not more, discussion and criticism as any other (zelda) game.  

it is pretty obvious how he spend more then 3 years writing the script to that video, it is ALL OVER THE PLACE.  
and the needless bashing on SS just show he loosely he tied all his 'parts' together."
93104,"Yeah, when he said ""this is hard"" I almost choked in my drink, it wasn't pretty.
