6157,"I think one of the other thing that got me was just how compartmentalized the items were in some cases. I mean, I know the whole formula of Zelda games has a focus on using the item in the dungeon to beat the dungeon, but there were a few items that were rarely used again, and a couple of them had huge potential. 

For example, the ball and chain was a bit clunky to be super practical, but I still liked it, but you didn't use it much. It hit hard, but moving slow was usually too impractical.

I mean, I know the spinner was used a few times outside of Arbiter's Grounds, but not a ton. Thank goodness. The animations of things done by the spinner (like raising shit out of the sand) and the boss fight was pretty cool, if gimmicky, but otherwise I personally think the spinner is stupid.  

The one that really got me, though, was the Dominion Rod. Yes, I know you solved some puzzles with it during the quest to get to City in the Sky (which follows the tedium or restoring Ilia's memory), but other than that, you almost never use it. I think that could have had some excellent applications, but it ended up being little more than an inventory placeholder.

17501,"I don't think you could do anything with the Dominion Rod if there weren't statues around. You should be able to! It's a stick! Use the damn thing as a bludgeoning weapon! 

For what it's worth, I dislike Skyward Sword too. "
