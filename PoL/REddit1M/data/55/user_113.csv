40795,"Damn, pretty late to this thread, and a lot of what I was gonna say has already been said, but I'll add my two cents anyway, I suppose.

**WARNING. WIND WAKER IS MY FAVORITE ZELDA GAME, AND I ADMIT THAT THIS DOES INFLUENCE A FEW OF THE REASONS WHY I LIKE TWILIGHT PRINCESS LESS THAN THE OTHER 3D ZELDA GAMES.**
Anyway...

1. The artstyle really isn't my favorite in the series. I always prefer the more animated artstyles because they'll always look better as time goes on. When TP first came out, it looked gorgeous. Now though, it doesn't look even close to the way it did before. That's because realistic artstyles will always age horribly. Look at GTA4. At the time, the realism looked phenomenal. Now, the animations can be very laughably bad at times. GTA5 is starting to get this way too, and that game is only a year old. On the flip side though, look at Wind Waker when it first came out. Now look at it again, 11 years later. Even on the GameCube, it still looks just as breathtaking as it did before, and that's because of the cartoony cel shaded artstyle.

2. The new items in Twilight Princess are really cool, but you really don't get to use them that much outside of their dungeon. The Spinner, Ball and Chain, and the Dominion Rod, to be precise. The Spinner gets used a lot in the Arbiter's Grounds, and then gets 4 mandatory uses again throughout the rest of the game. The Ball and Chain does not. I don't believe you ever have to use it outside of the Snowpeak Ruins. And the same goes for the Dominion Rod. In fact, after the Temple of Time, you literally can't use the Dominion Rod again. And then there's the slingshot, which shouldn't have even been in this game. You get the bow very early on, and then the slingshot never sees use again. The Clawshot/Double Clawshot does get used consistently, which is pretty cool, even though it's really just a fancier Hookshot.

3. The overworld is empty. Massive, but empty. I've heard Skyrim's overworld described as ""large as an ocean, deep as a puddle"" meaning that, while huge, doesn't really have a lot of depth. The same could be applied to TP's Hyrule Field. There just really isn't anything to do. There are some bugs to catch, a few chests to grab, some enemies to fight, a couple of hidden holes, and that's it. If the field were the same size as Ocarina of Time's field, then my opinion would change, but it's not. It's four times the size, meaning there should be four times the amount of things you can do.

4. The lack of side quests upset me. It just seemed like after Majora's Mask and Wind Waker, I was ready for loads of side quests, and unfortunately, this wasn't the case. It was like this in Skyward Sword too, which worried me greatly. I hope Zelda U doesn't continue this trend. I will say that the few minigames you get to play are a lot of fun though, namely the snowboarding, and the star game in castle town.

5. The misconception that TP is dark. I went over this [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/truezelda/comments/2iif6i/what_are_your_most_hated_legend_of_zelda/cl2nceu) a while back, so I'll just mention it briefly. The comments in that thread changed my opinion a bit, but overall, I stand by what I said.

6. Once again, going back  to my preference toward Wind Waker, but this always bothered me. I've always felt that Twilight Princess was Nintendo's attempt at ""correcting the mistakes they made"" with Wind Waker, and by doing so, they made it extremely similar to Ocarina of Time. People complained about the art style, so they went back to a realistic style. People complained about sailing, so they went back to fields and horses. People complained about a large number of things, so Nintendo fell back on old mechanics and tropes that people liked before, and the end result was Twilight Princess being pretty much Ocarina of Time 2.0; almost a remake, rather than a new game entirely.

This is getting really long as is, so I'll stop here. I'd just like to say that, while there are a lot of things I dislike about this game, my overall experience with my two playthroughs was very positive. I do like Twilight Princess, and I'd recommend it to anyone who's never played it before. It's just that TP is, in my opinion, the weakest, and least original of the main series 3D console games. It seems like every mechanic from TP was borrowed from another Zelda game, but none of the mechanics worked as well as they did before. In all honesty though, having to think about TP so much has made me pretty eager to play it again, so maybe a third playthrough may change a few of my opinions."
