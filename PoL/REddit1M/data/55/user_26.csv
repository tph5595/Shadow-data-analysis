7546,"It certainly wasn't the only Zelda game to have utterly useless items. Allow me to direct your attention to the all-time fan-favorite, Ocarina of Time, and the Ice Arrows, which are probably the most challenging item to acquire, aside from Biggoron's Sword, and had **absolutely no useful function at all** in the entire game. Other than missing out on the challenges of the Gerudo training grounds, which are actually pretty fun, you would miss nothing by not having them at all.

Most of them have at least one or two items like this."
