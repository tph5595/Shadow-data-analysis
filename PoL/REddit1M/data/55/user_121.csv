46571,"For me personally it was the graphical style. Not the art direction, but the fact that everything is so damn orange and blooming with it really hurts my eyes as I am colorblind. But the game itself was great, at least the GameCube version was at least. I wasn't a huge fan of the wii version except that you got one more item to use.

I wouldn't mind an HD version with that adjusted and corrected the lighting, I would play the crap out of it actually. It would probably make the best of both versions and would be a huge success just like Wind Waker was. Also I think a skyward sword remake that gave the option to do without the motion controls would help a lot of old school Zelda fans really get into the game, as I'm sure it was a large reason there were mixed reviews on the game. I personally really liked SS once I got used to the controls, and I personally liked the story more than TP, and I think opening up the game to everyone else would be a great move, and fit in with nintendos ""everyone can play"" attitude.
