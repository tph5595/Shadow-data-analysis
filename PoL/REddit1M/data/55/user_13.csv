Twilight Princess is my least favorite console Zelda title to date, but not for the popular reasons listed, but here are a few of my reasons.

-Painfully slow start.

-The wolf form was meh in general, but the collecting bug mini game got redundant fast, and bored me to tears.

-I hate how Zant was the main antagonist, and then, at the very end, shoehorned to Ganon, for the sake of ""GANON HAS TO BE THE BAD GUY"" tradition/thing.

-Hyrule field felt pretty empty and barren. (To be fair, this is something I have a gripe with in all 3D Zelda games.)

-The 5 pieces of heart thing didn't sink well with me personally, wasn't particularly bad though.

-Some of the mini-games/side-quests were just weird and out of taste for a Zelda game. Like the collecting bugs for that lady or whatever.

-The sword upgrades felt useless, and because they were optional, they had to be useless, and couldn't be required for anything.

-I played the Wii version. The motion controls worked okay/meh most of the time, but never was GOOD. If it wasn't meh or okay, it was awful.

-With the exception of the Ball &amp; Chain and maybe the Gale Boomerang, the weapons/items in this game were pretty boring, and didn't offer anything new.

ALL of this being said, however. I'm not one of those people who really express ill-hate towards this game to my friends or online or anyone in general, I just didn't enjoy the game as much as I enjoyed other Zelda titles."
6600,"Yeah. You're totally right, but the Dominion Rod and the Spinner is that, while they were cool when you first got them, (and I know you literally just said this) you didn't use them often.

I guess you could say the same thing about other Zelda games too, the item that comes to mind immediately is the Megaton Hammer.

Yeah, you rarely used that item, but it was still a weapon. If you wanted to kill something with it, you could. The Spinner and the Dominion Rod, not so much. (Well, maybe you could with the Dominion Rod, I'm a little rusty on the items in TP.)

There is also the fact that the Double Clawshot upgrade/item was lazy, and the game could have totally been designed without having two clawshots. At least Skyward Sword (I have my issues with this game too, but let's save that for another day.) cut the bullshit and just gave you both right away, but that could just be learning from their mistakes.   "
61488,I also thought the longshot was lazy to be fair; an upgrade to an item just to cross a larger distance is pretty boring to me. I don't know. It's my opinion. You don't have to agree with it.
