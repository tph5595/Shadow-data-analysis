9649,"I agree with almost everything you said, but would like to add one of the biggest for me: many of the items were totally useless outside of the dungeon got them it (or a few puzzles later).  Specifically I mean the Ball and Chain, Spinner, and Dominion Rod.  They are all so bad in 99% of situations."
10088,"&gt; Honestly, though, it's not all bad. It's not like it was Skyward Sword.

What!?  I loved Skyward Sword!  The art style was colorful and fantastic, the upgrade system on sub items/shields was a nice touch, the stamina mechanic was fun (Link felt so much more mobile), the bosses were some of my favorite in the series, the dungeon items were almost all great, and the pacing past the intro was pretty fantastic.  Also the final boss was amazing and several of the temples were top notch.  The Sand Sea is also probably my favorite place in any Zelda game.  

I admit it's not perfect, the overworld did feel segmented, though I kind of liked how sparse the sky was (reminded me of The Wind Waker) and I did encounter some hiccups with the controls (though I generally enjoyed them).  That said, I would place it second in my list of favorite 3D Zelda games (under OoT and above TWW).

Why did you think it was so bad (or subpar, I don't mean to put words in your mouth)?"

Eh, Egoraptor is kind of hit or miss for me.  He can make some good points, but kind of blows everything out of proportion for entertainment.  I get it, he is an entertainer, but still.  Half of that video is a silly analogy when he could of just said ""I think this game gets undue praise because of its name.""

&gt; But that was way too little in a pile of terrible drivel masquerading as a Zelda game.

I almost stopped reading right here.  I'm glad I didn't, because you have solid things to say past such an overly dramatic opener.

&gt; In addition to what Egoraptor mentioned in the video, the entire game seemed rushed and incomplete. Oh, you have to kill this annoying boss where you kill puss-filled toes? Great, hope you enjoy killing it three times! 

I can agree with The Imprisoned.  3 was a bit much.

&gt; Oh, you enjoy exploring this area? Sure hope you enjoy exploring it again while playing an odd stealth game then again when some random mechanic has changed like it's flooded and you're collecting music notes for no adequately explained reason. They reused everything, well past the point of it being entertaining.

This never bothered me.  I kind of enjoyed revisiting the zones with a twist.  I thought they put more detail and stuff into each zone than in any other Zelda so I didn't mind.  It kind of like Pikmin: there are only a few zones, but each was really well done.  In my opinion anyway.

&gt; There was no real world to explore, and everything was reused. In no other Zelda game do you literally have to walk through an empty dungeon you already beat.

I kind of agree with you.  There was no continuous world to explore, but I enjoyed exploring the sections.  I do wish it were more open.  You totally have to walk through sections of dungeon that you already beat several times in Phantom Hourglass.

&gt; I'm not going to talk about Fi because honestly there's a 87.5% chance she really didn't annoy me any more than Navi or Tatl did. I consider that a draw.

I found each of them mildly annoying, but never enough to complain about.

&gt; Ultimately, there was no exploration, no freedom, bad controls, and consistent reuse of everything.  It had super neat moments like the sky whale and the lumpy pumpkin, but you had to go through the same annoying fight three times in order to get to those cool things, and throughout it all Link is by far the hardest part of the game, harder than any boss. By the time I'd gotten to the sand dungeon, the game had already lost me, and I could only help but think, ""Wow, this is kind of fun, I wonder if it will be fun when I have to come through here for the third time?"" Because that was the game's MO for most areas.

I suppose we may just be looking for different things.  I appreciate that the game tried something new and went for smaller, more layered areas rather than sheer expanse.  I much prefer the areas in Skyward Sword to the giant barren field of Twilight Princess.  I guess going back and revisiting never bothered me because it was always a bit different each time.  It kind of reminded me of certain aspects of Metroid or Castlevania (though with less freedom, I'll give you that).  I think I felt like SS has far less freedom than other games, but not necessarily less of a sense of exploration.  It kind of forces the area you explore, but not how you go about it necessarily.  I also feel like the overworld is more dungeonlike than previous Zelda games.  SS was more of a string of dungeons and puzzles and I think that's okay.  I actually enjoyed that it strayed a bit from the open-overworld -&gt; puzzling dungeon split cycle that the other games have.  It helps differentiate it from the other dozen+ Zelda games.  I would rather that than a game like Twilight Princess, which basically felt like Ocarina of Time 2.

&gt; In many Zelda games, I always feel like what I'm doing helps my quest. I'm saving a sage, getting a magic crest, collecting the triforce, whatever. In this game, I always felt I was playing a particular level not because it helped my quest, but because the developers felt at this point I really needed to do a stealth game with no items, and then at this point they really felt I should be collecting music notes. There was no sense of connection or overarching purpose in literally anything you did.

I never really felt that way.  I actually really liked the section of the game where you're tempering the Goddess Sword.  It was a cycle of outdoor section -&gt; new item -&gt; dungeon -&gt; new item -&gt; more awesome sword and I loved it.  I was getting something neat after everything I did.  Compared to other 3D Zelda games, it really feels like Link gets substantially stronger from start to finish and I really enjoyed that.  

I'm also only lukewarm on the stealth sections, but still applaud the developers for trying something new.  And some things didn't make so much sense, but I kind of liked the whimsy of the music notes.  It gave the game a nice sense of silliness and irreverence that I appreciate.  to each their own.

&gt; In terms of 3D Zelda games, many have been far from perfect. But I never quit on Windwaker until I beat it. I always felt an urge to keep going, to save Hyrule. But by the the third time I had to fight the Imprisoned I literally said, ""Oh come on!"" turned off the game, and didn't pick it up for months.

It's funny because I did the exact opposite.  I couldn't stop playing SS, despite hating fighting The Imprisoned three times (that we totally agree on).  On the other hand, the first time I played TWW, I quit during the Triforce collection section of the game and didn't finish for months.

&gt;And that, my friend, is the short version of my rant. Bet you regret asking me now (-:

Not at all."
