It really shows that link's first love will always be Hyrule above all else because his soul was hardened to anything else. While I recognize that the manga isn't ""officially"" canon (even though it was in the darn lorebook) I think it really shows that any romance in the games needs to come from zelda and link needs to be almost oblivious to it. Hylia loves link for giving up everything, his life, his family, his friends, for Hyrule and that's supposedly the whole reason they reincarnate to fight evil together.

I'm not saying it adds depth to the game to give link love interests, I just think that if it's rooted in the story and lore of the whole series you can't really say it doesn't belong."

Heroes have families too, and usually they care about their family more than about anything else. I think Link is different in that he would sacrifice everything he has, including his loved ones, to save Hyrule and its people.

I don't think Link and Zelda should ever be a couple at the end of a LoZ game, but I'd love to see a story where they start out as a solid couple and then their relationship degrades as Zelda is alienated by Link's dedication to his people."

While I agree that in SS Link and Zelda are definitely just childhood friends, I think that if the world hadn't been put in danger that they would have become a couple. It's not like anybody else in Skyloft had a close relationship with Zelda."
