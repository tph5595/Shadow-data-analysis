6193,"I really fucking hated the bug hunt as a wolf. It was a massive time waster and wasn't really enjoyable during any playthrough. This shit was just lazily thrown in to make the game seem longer. 
The music for the twilight beast is fucking awful, I thought it was cool my first time through but afterwards I couldn't stand it. It was painful to hear it. 
It's easy and a majority of the ""dungeons"" sucked. 
I enjoyed finding the hidden techniques but they were not very beneficial besides the badass way to put your sword away. 
The fucking forced fights while in wolf form was annoying as fuck and just seemed repetitive and just slowed the game down really hard. "
