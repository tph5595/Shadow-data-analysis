62791,"I have ~~two~~ three problems with SS:

1.  Fi is annoying as hell.  She's Navi on steroids.  At least with Navi, you could deal with a binking c-up and ignore her most of the time.  Fi stops you in your tracks, repeats herself multiple times, and treats you like a child (which admittedly, fits into Nintendo's target audience of general consumers).
2.  Being forced to read the material text *every time you boot the game up* for every material got really old, really quickly.
3.  Fighting The Imprisoned became a real chore.

The first two problems could be solved with a simple option of ""disable tutorials"" or something.  It's so rare to find games that just throw you straight into the game now.

At the *very* least, that crap should be disabled when you run Hero Mode.

I loved the game in just about every other aspect."

You take your blasphemy elsewhere.

N64 or go home."

It's true, but the intro really made it hurt.

1.  YEAH!  Wolf form!  This is gonna kick ass!
2.  ....It's pretty underwhelming...
3.  Man, this sucks.  When can I be normal Link again?
4.  Holy crap, just let me be human again.
5.  Why did I pay $60 for this damn game?

All in the span of the first hour of gameplay.

It really turned me off from the entire game.  Instead of being able to just enjoy it for what it was, the impression it left on me was that the game was a chore.  Literally *any* time I had to turn into a wolf, I hated it a little bit more.

Deku &amp; Goron Link were awesome.  Zora Link was meh.  Wolf Link made me want to join Ganon and bring the Hylian Apocalypse so I never have to play the TP timeline again."
