85142,That dungeon is the worst. 
85743,"I loved skyward sword, but my main complaints are map-related. I want the option of having the map on screen like with every other 3D Zelda game. Maybe I'm weird but I actually use those. I also want to be able to check my map in a menu screen and look at any area. I really really don't like that I can only look at the place I'm currently adventuring in. 

Also, I have mixed feelings about the mission-based overworld. I enjoyed most of the tasks, but by the time I completed them I just wanted to get to the dungeon and had no desire to aimlessly wander around and explore like I usually do. 

Other than these minor things I have no complaints. I am VERY excited for the Zelda Wii U game, though!"
