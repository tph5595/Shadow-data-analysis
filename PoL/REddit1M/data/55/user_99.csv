28347,"The ""tutorial"" phase of the game felt like it went on way too long. I understand that it was a release-day game and we needed extra effort to get used to the motion controls, but it really treated you like you were dumb and didn't spend time playing Wii Sports or building Miis. The wolf wasn't really fun. It felt like a chore whenever I had to spend time locked as the wolf. The wolf was a major part of the plot but it didn't feel like it could do too much that was both fun and special to being just the wolf."
