26771,"For me, I didn't really like it for a few reasons.

1) Overworld - My problem here is not so much that it's boring and there's like nothing to do in it, but the fact that it was so big AND the things I mentioned. I thought for OoT, it was fine, because, to me, that overworld didn't feel too big, so it didn't feel as big a chore to run around in.

2) Art style - I actually feel the opposite of this that most do when comparing it with The Wind Waker. I felt that art style was better, but I would not want to change it for TP, because it fit the game perfectly. Simply put, I just didn't like the realism and the dull colours, as it reminded me of the kind of games I didn't like to buy.

3) The start of the game was probably the most boring thing to me. Which leads into my last problem...

4) The Wolf - I don't think anything else needs to be said. Playing as the wolf sucked. It was only good for the Twilight portals. Any time I played the wolf, I so badly wanted to be Link again."
