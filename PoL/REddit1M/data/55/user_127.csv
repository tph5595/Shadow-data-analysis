48648,"Rook me a while to notice the subreddit this was posted and realize the conversation is about Twilight Princess. I must be quite the odd egg because overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the game. I did find some of the segways tedious, especially the ""gathering tears"" in Lake Hylia, though I actually ragequit several times when trying to reach Snowpeak Castle. Easily my favorite dungeon of all time (I love ice, snow, and winter, plus the salmon soup recipe? To die for), but that and the graphics are really the only great things I can point out.

It tried to be dark, but was nothing near MM. It tried to be realistic, and on gamecube, it was better than OoT but worse on Wii. It tried to be playful with those damn kids who should just GET OFF MY LAWN. Seriously, I absolutely loathe those little snot-nosed shits. At least in WW they made the kids into believable characters instead of a bunch of mentally retarded, vertically challenged fuckwits. The only half smart one was a capitalist dick, and... Ooh, I hate them.

Anyway, that's my two cents, and it really is one of my favorite Zelda games to dick around on. Just don't expect me to start a new file without cheating past those little brats..."
