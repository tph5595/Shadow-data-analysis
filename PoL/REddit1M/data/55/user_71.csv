It's always arrive at the new area as a wolf, get the bugs, free the area of twilight, go to the temple, repeat. It got really boring to me and took away the feel of exploration. I also absolutely do not enjoy any bit of the wolf play. 

Characters felt very flat to me. I felt no ties to anyone, especially Midna. I know that a lot of people feel totally opposite but I felt Midna was completely underdeveloped. I never bought her motives or interaction with Link. 

Overall all the concepts were there for it to be one of my favorites but I always felt like they dropped the ball on what things I wanted more of. I liked the idea of an ineffective hylian guard with discontent citizens making an underground organization to stop Gannon. They touched the idea with showing a little of Telma's bar but it never went anywhere. I felt like after Link saves Collin he has no personal motive to care anymore other than ""because you're the hero and you have to care about this princess"".

Items and temples were overall excellent but outside the temples there was so little to do in the world. The overworld was huge but felt like a placeholder. ""here's the spot to ride the horse fast because we want that to be a thing in this one"". I need more of a sense of the secrets to uncover. I loved the spinner but there were so few places to use it outside temples... Etc. It left this strange barren void. If I get off the horse in Hyrule field it just feels very pointless. I can find a ruppee I can put back, I can get a heart piece I don't need. I also am completely against having a mandatory mini game to get to an area. I want every area accessible through exploration. I don't want to have to talk to a weird clown and fly a cucco to get to the lake. I don't want another weird clown to shoot me to the desert. It broke up the exploration and ruined the continuity of the land for me. 

Bosses were awesome looking and intimidating....  Until you realized every single one dies in a three attack set order. Do the thing to stun them, attack until they get up, do twice more and they are gone. Plus damage was a joke in this game. Everything did a quarter heart. Where are the 4 heart hits of an Iron Knuckle? I thought the music lacked the real stir and excitement that I felt hearing other overworld themes. 

Overall the game is full of potential and has a nice look, excellent temples and items, but completely lacks character development or investment for me. The overworld feels empty and sidequests sparse. I hate Midna and the wolf. I was so stoked for this game for about 4 years so I think I just built my expectations from the where nothing could meet them. "
17577,There's nothing hardcore about TP. It is the easiest Zelda game in terms of enemy/boss damage. Everything only does 1/4 heart.
