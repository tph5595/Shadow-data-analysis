6982,"Twilight Princess was the first Legend of Zelda game I ever played and I loved every minute it. I just finished playing through Wind Waker HD on Wii U and I must admit it was a huge relief being able to use the pro controller instead of waving the Wii remote around like a maniac. 

I'm also currently half way through Skyward Sword (put it on hold to play Wind Waker HD as i got it as a free download with Mario Kart 8) and I'm not looking forward to going back to the Wii remote waving, though at least it's the Wii remote plus, so it's not quite as bad as the original Wii remote / Twilight Princess combination.

Off topic, but which Legend of Zelda should I play next? I have all the Nintendo consoles (though would probably just use an emulator for NES / SNES titles).

TLDR: The wii remote controls were a let down in Twilight Princess."
