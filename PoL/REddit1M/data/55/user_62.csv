14391,"I really liked it, but one of the things that annoyed me was that there wasn't anything to spend my money on. I've played through twice, and I just found myself running around most of the game with a full wallet and nothing to spend it on.

There really should have been more interesting things to spend money on, even just silly fun things. "
