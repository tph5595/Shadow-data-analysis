20728,"I want to like Skyward Sword more because I feel it had a lot going for it. Lovable characters, colorful and vibrant worlds, memorable moments... But it was such a pain in the ass to actually play. It was artificially extended by rehashing the same parts in the three main area. The game kept finding some reason for me to trek up and down that damn volcano, and the water dragon kept doubting that I was really the hero and kept testing me. Much of the game felt like a chore because of this. The motion controls worked well 90% of the time, but in a 30-40 hour game that 10% adds up fast.  
  
The sky was a big empty void. They somehow found something more boring than an ocean, and found somehow to make flying restrictive and boring. I understand that the game had technical limitations, but it didn't result in it being fluid.  
  
...And yet I WANT to like it more. I want it to be less of a pain in the ass to actually play so I can enjoy everything else more."
20906,I loved the wiimote controls. Something satisfying about even a removed analog of flicking the wiimote and slicing through an enemy. The bow controls were perfect (no idea why they bothered changing it for SS; it was more accurate and hassle-free in TP).
