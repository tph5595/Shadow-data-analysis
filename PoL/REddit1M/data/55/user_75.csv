18439,"Remember, to those complaining about the overworld being vast and empty, I hope you hold this same criticism to Ocarina of Time as well, which had a much more empty overworld.

Me personally I enjoyed the spacious overworld. Not every square inch has to have content on it. Look at Shadow of the Colossus. Yes I know that was done for thematic reasons, but the feel of exploring vastness is the same for me. 

I think the spaciousness has to be done properly. I think it needs to evoke a sense of exploration and adventure, and that response will vary depending from person to person.

Wind Waker's sea played on the idea of the unknown. Whats out there across the seas? I enjoyed the feeling of seeing islands come closer and closer in view, not knowing what they contained.

Skyward Swords ""sky"" was confined. There was nothing to explore, and there was no sense of unknown. The majority of the game was spent going from portal to portal in chore-like fashion. "
