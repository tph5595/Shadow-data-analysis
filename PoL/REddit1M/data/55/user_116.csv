I mean Arin sucked horribly at that game (like really bad, I haven't seen a GG playthrough where they were THAT incompetent, even Danny was better at Shadows of the Colossus than Arin was at WW and Danny barely plays new video games) but they seemed to have a fun time doing it."

Also, Midna is up there with Tatl as one of the best helper characters ever. Also, frozen leaf snowboarding, Yeto's mansion (forget what that dungeon is called) and Arbiter's Grounds."
