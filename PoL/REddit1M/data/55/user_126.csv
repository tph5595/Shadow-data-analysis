He had some good points hidden in there: Zelda should be about exploration. My favorite Zelda games have included vibrant worlds with tons of secrets... but the majority of what he was saying were flaws were actually things that could *easily* coexist alongside exploration."
49720,"/u/malaroo covered it pretty well for my complaints.

When I first started playing, I loved it. The intro to the game, in my opinion, is fantastic. My jaw dropped in awe as I first entered Hyrule Field--*this game is huge*, I thought with excitement.

And then I found the world to be bland. There was no excitement of finding a new place, like Wind Waker had. The dark, gritty style was cool, but *everything* was brown, gray, and maybe-sort-of-green. It was, to me, Ocarina of Time rehashed, except dressed in drab colors. I'd already played OoT; I didn't need to play its gloomy, empty cousin.

Also, as an addition, I don't like the sci-fi aesthetic of the Twilight Realm's monsters (I have similar complaints about the robots in SS). It just feels... I dunno, like it doesn't fit.

Zant was an *epic* antagonist, then the twist just... left me disappointed. He could have been like FFVI's Kefka, basically destroying the world and ascending to insane godhood, but instead he copped out and then we had Ganondorf again. I don't mind having Ganondorf as an antagonist, but Zant could have been amazing.

I adored a couple of the dungeons, mainly Snowpeak and Arbiter's Grounds, but the rest of the dungeons could have been much more. The Temple of Time was built up to be *amazing*, and then was just the Tower of the Gods all over again. I felt like this was reflective of the game as a whole--it could have been so much more, but was just a dull version of what had come earlier.

I don't blame people for liking it. I don't think your opinion is invalid or anything; one of my close friends *loves* TP and considers it his favorite game. I respect that. There are elements I really enjoy about it too. I wouldn't say I hated it, but it left me feeling disappointed."
