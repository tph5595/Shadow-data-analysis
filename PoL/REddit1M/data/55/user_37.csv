9982,"Overall I really liked the game, but no where near as much as other entries in the series. I only really had three issues with the game. They weren't game breaking to me, but they're what makes it hard for me to go back and play the game.

Hyrule was pointlessly massive, which made traversing feel like a chore instead of discovery. Wind Waker had that issue too, but each island in each sector had a purpose to travel to in the end, and each island didn't feel massive.

Zant was such an awesome villain. The reveal of Ganondorf was just a disappointment. I hated Ganondorf in Ocarina of Time, I love Hyrule and when I saw it years later in ruins because of him. Zant was this cruel invader, but for him not to be the master mind? And besides, as far as I was concerned I buried Ganondorf in Wind Waker, and that was such a perfect ending to him I felt it cheapened him to just bring him back as the villain.

It was dark and bleak. Majora's Mask by comparison was dark, but I was around characters I loved, and it was still colorful a relatively colorful game, and full of hope in the end. Twilight Princess just left me feeling depressed and not wanting to return to the game."
