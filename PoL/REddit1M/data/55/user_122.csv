46750,This link having love interests thing needs to die in my opinion. I liked the zelda games because it felt like Link always put the world and people he saved above all of his own personal feelings. They never really put in the link and zelda love interest stuff until SS and I frankly hated it and found it pointless.
47338,I see the bad anime argument a lot (and agree and have made the case to friends). I feel like it's only overlooked by people who've always wanted the link and zelda romance concept to be validated and I'll never understand it.
61950,"You do understand the difference I mean by love, right? I'm talking about people who want/see link and zelda as a couple. I don't think that belongs for any reason in the story. Why does link need typical human romance when he basically always lives a life that has no time or place for it. You even mention that he loves Hyrule above all else. I don't need to see him fall in love in a typical human sense."
