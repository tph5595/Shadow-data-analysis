I didn't buy the connections with them, it was like, here's a gaggle of sad saps you have to save for some reason. Compared with the colorful personalities and strong connections with the characters in OoT, MM, and SS it's one of the weak points."
30626,Yeah! They're all just so dang endearing. You care about the world you're saving.
31165,"Yeah. And the love interest with Ilia is not very believable. They never have any real connection, hell, they never even touch each other! SS you totally fall in love with Zelda."

95247,"Sure, there are just a handful of characters that are the main focus, but I always found that the games with a multitude of side characters make the whole world more endearing. Like in MM you've got all the Clock Town characters and the various characters you have to help in the 4 main areas. It feels like you're really trying to help everyone, not just your main good guys.

I guess it's somewhere in the middle between SotC and MM, the mysterious world versus the endearing world. I guess if you go in expecting or hoping for it to go one way or the other you'd be disappointed."
