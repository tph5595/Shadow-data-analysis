16226,"Here's one: they were shoved in, clunky, distracting and obtrusive. Also not fun. Oh, I get to fight the same moblin for the 100th time and put my sword in four directions around his shield again? Repetitious. Bring me an actual combat technique to use. Oh, the boss key is a turning puzzle? Why? Is there any reason other than the fact that Nintendo wanted to shove in their new gimmick that was failing so hard in every other game for its system? Or randomly shoving a sword into things and twisting to unlock forward progress? There is no purpose for me, the player, to do that and doing so takes me out of the game's immersion. 

SS's motion controls were distracting, obtrusive, and not intuitive. "
