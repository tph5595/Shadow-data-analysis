2736,TP is my favorite Zelda but I have a few problems with it. Beginning kinda sucks and is slow. The overworld is terrible. Not as bad as OoT though. Bit easy.
10835,"I love Midna, I love the dungeons, I love the art, I love the items, I love the environments. I love all the memorable parts like fighting that guy on the bridge and then twice after that or the western shootout. The game felt epic. The architecture was really cool on a lot of the buildings. They put new twists on old items to make them even better. The music was also pretty great. Not the best but good."
52173,"MM dungeons are actually my favorite. I think they're by far the best. The only drawback is the fact that there are only 4.
