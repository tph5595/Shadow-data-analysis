1519,"I like it a lot, it's actually pretty high on my list of favorites... but it does have a huge amount of flaws.

To me, the art-style is drab and boring.  Nothing against realism, no, but realism contains more colors than the faded green and brownish orange that makes up 90% of TP... which is done for the sake of making the game seem 'dark' and 'grim', and yet it doesn't actually manage to be as dark as most other Zelda games, aside from the color palette.

The pacing is wretched and all over the place.  It takes 2-3 hours to even start your quest, and it only gets a little better afterwards.

The overworld is empty and segmented.  It didn't feel like one large, cohesive world like most other Zeldas.  It felt like a few large, empty rooms, often only accessible through 'special' means because of how disconnected it was.

It's *absurdly* easy.  There is *one* place you might actually have to worry about dying in the game, and that's the Snowpeak Ruins.  Everything else is pretty much completely without challenge.

It has *two* fantastic dungeons (Snowpeak and City in the Sky) but the rest are *absolutely* flat, boring and tedious.  The Forest Temple was basically 'go save some monkeys that constantly make annoying sounds', and the Fire Temple came down to 'walk really slowly along these magnetic walls'.  Everything else was just a rehashed, less impressive version of a dungeon from a previous Zelda game.

The combat, to me, feels clunky as all hell.  The sword movements are slow and choppy, and the hidden techniques that *would be* awesome actually become absolutely useless and mundane as they're actually less efficient at killing than just mashing the B button.

It's still a great game all-in-all, but there are a plethora of legitimate reasons people have to dislike it."
4555,"Because aside from all those flaws, it still has a lot of things that make it very fun to play.  A ""bad"" Zelda game is still usually a cut above the rest."
6664,"I agree with that as well, and through that the whole story itself felt a little hard to care about.

In Wind Waker for example, I wanted to 'save Hyrule' to help Link's little group of family/friends.  They felt integral to the whole thing - almost the most important part.

In Twilight Princess it was just a couple of neighborhood kids that Link had to save because he's Link."
40319,"Honestly, the 'link' between Ilia and Link was so mild that I never even considered them to be anything more than friends on my first playthrough.  "
40422,"I very much did enjoy Stallord, especially with the musical throwback to Volvagia.

Don't get me wrong, though.  Like I said, I still love the game, and many parts of it are very fun.  It has some really good bosses, aside from the fact that they're mostly piss-easy."
40741,"I knew someone would pick that one out, but to me it seemed just like Tower of the Gods.

Now that dungeon was actually one of the most disappointing things in any Zelda for me.  It's the freakin' Temple of Time, it had *so* much potential for awesome, crazy things to happen... but really all you do is walk up some stairs, takin' out baddies along the way, grab the item at the top, and then walk back down the stairs to the boss.  I can't personally think of a dungeon that I would consider worse than it, which is again, a huge shame, because of the potential.

You know, the whole concept is actually ripped *straight* from cut content from Ocarina of Time.  If you look at the Temple of Time (from OoT) in a level editor, you can see the *exact* same rainbow/magic staircase leading up to the window behind the Master Sword.  It was theorized to lead to the 'Light Temple' back in day, and when I saw it in Twilight Princess I almost shat myself with excitement... until I actually played the dungeon."
41113,"I'd actually consider Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask to be a better take on serious, realism.

I understand where you're coming from when you say you want seriousness in Zelda, and I agree (though I do like the cartooniness as well), but I don't feel that TP was actually all that serious.

It certainly *tried* to seem serious... but if you compared its content to anything relatable from past Zelda games, it fell flat.  When a kid dresses up in all black clothes and walks around all broodingly, it's more silly to me than the 'serious' that they're going for, and that's how I see TP.

Darkness is shallow without light to give it contrast, and Twilight Princess lacked that contrast.  It was just kind of a murky mix of mid-toned darkness to me.

But I do agree that the bosses were fantastic, even though they were too easy."
41761,"I loved the sections of Twilight, actually.  They're some of my all-time favorite parts of Zelda, even despite the fact that I don't enjoy playing as a wolf.  The music still gives me chills to this day.

However, when the *entire* game consists of that theme (or a less intense version of it during the non-twilight sections) it becomes bland to me.  Contrast is important to show the weight of an opposing situation, and Twilight Princess lacked anything to weigh against the Twilight.  Hyrule itself was already so 'washed out' that the Twilight didn't seem like much of a threat/change at all.  I often asked myself a question that Midna actually asks in game - 'Is the world being covered in perpetual twilight really all that bad?' (paraphrasing) - and she's right.  It didn't actually seem like some terrible, horrible thing, because it didn't actually seem all that much different from normal Hyrule.

A good example of the contrast I'm talking about would be Ocarina of Time's worlds as young and adult Link.  In the beginning, when you're a kid, everything is so absolutely bright and cheery that it makes Hyrule seem like the nearest place to Heaven, and this makes the impact of seeing Hyrule Market/Castle decimated as adult Link *much* more powerful.  It's a *serious* change, one that is unquestionably horrible.  Twilight Princess's entire mood being *already* dreary really takes away from the impact that anything negative (like Ganon or the Twilight) might have."
41989,"Yes, I agree, and that's actually much more of a flaw than it seems at first.

A lack of useful items is one thing, but with that comes with a lacking overworld, because your items offer no real exploration or progression inside of it.  Normally, a new item would mean new potential to explore new areas, but in TP, like you said... they simply don't.  They're mostly one-off dungeon tools, and this was a huge part of why the overworld felt so utterly empty and useless."
42507,"To me, TP and SS are the worst in the series (aside from the two DS games which I rarely even consider), but compared to 95% of other gaming?  They're absolute gold.  Even a shitty Zelda game is a great game."
42680,"I'm sorry but there are a *huge* amount of flaws with the motion controls.  Even if you like them, and even if you were lucky enough to have them work flawlessly... consider this:

At E3, when Miyamoto himself was demoing the game... he couldn't get the motion controls to do what they were supposed to.  This is in a situation where everything would have been absolutely optimal.  The player (Miyamoto) *obviously* knew what he was doing, and the set up was *obviously* tested before the presentation... but they still ran into *heavy* technical difficulties, and this was the case with a *huge* amount of people who played SS."
47194,"I 100% agree.  It reminds me of something I would have longed for... as a small child, but even back then I didn't care for it.

Reminds me of a bad anime.  In SS's case, specifically Inuyasha."
57203,"They often fail to read movements correctly.  For many players, the 'stab' move was the hardest to make work, simply because the Wiimote/game wasn't able to read it correctly.  Inputs are sometimes ignored completely, or misread to where Link will swing in the opposite direction of what you actually did.  For me personally, the wonkiest thing was the Skyward Strike.  I had to raise my Wiimote in *just* the *exact* right angle to make it work, and by that point I had usually already missed the opportunity to use it.

It's a very, very common complaint with the game.  Recalibration sometimes helped, but usually not for the specific ones (like Skyward Strike in my case), and it was always temporary."
57310,"No, I just thought there was interesting potential for the cut content to finally be shown, but was disappointed with the actual execution.  I expected much more from the legendary Temple of Time."
