55055,"&gt;  There is one place you might actually have to worry about dying in the game

The mines were rather difficult. Fire burns away your shield if you didnt upgrade and falling into lava did surprisingly serious damage, considering the rest of the game was ""any hit=1/4 heart"" affair.

EDIT: Also hijacking top commment:

My biggest issue was, despite a huge slew of creative ideas and items, they almost always under delivered. 

* There was obscene amount of potential for the Dominion Rod-and you use it for one small puzzle outside of its dungeon. 
* The Spinner was ludicrously fun, but outside of designated areas it was too slow to use at all. 
* They force a slingshot on you despite the fact that it gets replaced soooo quickly be a bow and arrow. 
* 'combining' equipment for special effects made a zooming bow (okay) and exploding arrows. 
* Different bomb types involved ""Bomb, same bomb but you can use it in water, and a bombchu that doesnt really work""
* they introduce you to a nifty lantern and oil system right away that is nothing but a pain to use. Never developing it int something more
* there is a large cast of supporting 'adventurers' to support you- who just stand outside of the entrance to the second wave of dungeons.
* horseback sword fighting was so fun in concept, but its so weak that its pointless

So much potential for awesomeness, but so little payoff"
55376,"Why not let Zelda possess other enemy types as well? Maybe she could be a Chuchu and squeeze into tight spaces, or a River Zora that can dive under water?"
55871,"Why limit it to just the desert?

Look at the hookshot in Ocarina of Time- you figured out that it would work on all wooden structures. This opened up tons of potential areas to use it to navigate, including some totally worthless ones (getting inside the windmill in Kakariko)

Then look at it in TP/SS- the Clawshot only works for designated spots. making it a glorified switch like every other item. No emergent gameplay, no huge boon to exploration (although not gonna lie, the double clawshot was a great touch)

Then look at how you use items in aLBW- while some are better than others, all of them have a huge array of uses outside of just activating their switches. 

Items should be given as much utility as possible, definitely not relegated to a single area or object"
64238,"Bear in mind that all of OoT's hyrule field is about the size of one quadrant of TP's, and in a game with the shortest day/night cycle of the series, you could pretty easily walk from one end to the other between sunrise and sunset. In contrast, any time you have to navigate the overworld without Epona in TP tends to be more tiresome than enjoyable

Skyward Sword disappointed me- the little floating islands were neat and jungle-gymy, but because you *knew* they were linked to the Goddess cubes you were discouraged from exploring them until you hit the right switch on the surface world"
64542,"There was more character development in the fisher's cabin, just from looking around and zooming in on stuff and letting her talk about it, than there was in practically the entire game"
65327,"Skyward Sword hits or misses depending on whether or not they liked the controls. I've literally *never* seen someone actively dislike the game without having a negative reaction to the controls, and I've never seen someone praise it without enjoying the controls.

Theres a bit of variance between the two, but its reliably been about the controls at the heart of it"
65835,"&gt; The disconnect between exploration and combat isn't an issue, its an issue HE has.
&gt; Sliding hockey pucks ""out of nowhere"" that any normal person would be keeping an eye out of since you can SEE the pucks when entering the rooms with them in (in fact every single room with those things in is designed in such a way that you can see their path before entering it)

Its hilarious. He describes *that exact situation* later on as something OoT is missing. A spinning spiked monster that you can't necessarily kill that forces you to be aware of your location in 3D space

He also complains about disjointed mechanics (How was I supposed to know I needed those stupid golden guantlets??!?) yet praised eqully disjointed mechanics (This one dungeon, you needed an item you found  *in some random ass cave*, how cool is that?!)"
71053,"I've got similar complaints. I didn't mind the first few dungeons so much (although I found having to retraverse the first one pointless, but the third dungeon was great if you didnt mind the anachronism) but Fi was terrible

To me the greatest issue was, outside of the core cast, there was no characterization, no story, no lore. The entire village was filled with no-name (or no personality) characters except for a few, and those few were largely just there to fill in archetypes we've seen before. There was no real depth to the Kikwis or Mogmas, and the robots despite living in a postapocalyptic time paradox never have any useful information except ""Bzzt Brrzzt I like mining timeshift stones!"" *they never gave the Crimson Loftwing a name!* They even brought back Gossip Stones, which existed to give hints but also provide crucial background information, and they never provide anything but super obvious game tips."
