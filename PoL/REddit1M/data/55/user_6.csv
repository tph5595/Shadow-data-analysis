3497,"/u/malaroo hit a lot of it. I would reiterate that the visuals really threw me. I had higher hopes for a game that was pushed back so long that it had to be put on a new platform, but TP looks just like a Gamecube game. I was hoping for some more interesting graphics coming from a brand-new console (I know graphics are really not the most important thing in a game, but even the color palette was just disheartening). I also felt like the world was cold and uncaring -- probably a goal for the game, but it threw me coming from the worlds of Wind Waker and Ocarina. I was still pretty young, like 12 or 13, and it honestly made me a little uncomfortable. It felt lonely. 
 
I found most of the wolf quests pretty boring -- I remember a lot of basic grinding. The fighting as wolf Link was just a more tedious version of regular combat, which, by the way, did *not* live up to my expectations. Just slashing back and forth rapidly easily killed almost any enemy. I was hoping for a chance to have some combat-like combat with my super cool motion remote that was supposed to define this system. 
 
I found it so disheartening I didn't even finish the game. I'd love to go and play it through sometime soon just to see the whole thing. I think I gave up after Snowpeak Ruins, so there was a good bit of game left. "
59644,"I think that's totally valid. I bet I would appreciate it a lot more at 20 then I did at 12, though -- I wasn't ready to be so alone in Zelda coming out of Ocarina and Wind Waker. "
