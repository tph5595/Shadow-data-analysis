14267,"I hope someone from Nintendo is taking notes from these kinds of threads and any other feedback they can get. It'd be fantastic if they made an effort to address the issues people inevitably find to complain about, rather than excusing themselves with the ""trying something new"" approach. You can try something new *and* address old issues.

Anyway, here's my two cents.

I liked the game, and I appreciated the motion control integration, although I was hoping for more advanced control like what they ended up doing with SS, on that front. 

After the introductory dungeons, we got a slew of one-time-use items for the remaining dungeons. The spinner had about three tracks outside of the temple. The ball and chain is utterly pointless, except as a redundant tool for boulder smashing. The Dominion Rod had no further utility outside of one or two piece-of-heart puzzles. The sword techniques were overpowered, to the point that combat was laughably easy, except when facing multiple dark knights. 

I'm seeing others complain about the lack of character endearment, and the segmented overworld. I can agree with those points, but I don't find them particularly important. You don't play Zelda games for advanced storytelling. They're designed so that a 5-year old can follow what's going on, so of course the story is only intricate enough to keep you interested. MM was the only one that took much analysis to understand. 

Others complain about the art style. I argue that it set the mood for the game. Without the dark undertones, it would have been a completely different setting, and would have conflicted with the intended environment.

Anyway, just my two cents. Agree or disagree as you will."

I have yet to hear even a slightly detailed argument about precisely *what* was wrong with the controls, other than whining that they didn't mimic the N64 titles. Oh, they weren't complicated enough? These games are designed for all ages, and that includes 5-year-old's. Since there are no difficulty settings on these games, aside from hard modes that unlock after you beat the game, they can't make it too intricate."

55350,"Ok. I don't mean to be attacking, here, but you didn't answer the question. I'm not asking how much went wrong or how badly it went wrong. I'm asking for details. Precisely WHAT went wrong? Can you give an example? Maybe I had these issues, but recalibrated my own movements to compensate, and had no problems beyond that. I won't know until I see some examples. "
