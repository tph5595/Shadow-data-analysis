16541,"&gt; Everything else was just a rehashed, less impressive version of a dungeon from a previous Zelda game.

Temple of Time?  It had its flaws to be sure, but I can't remember a similar dungeon."
16657,"Couldn't even use them on Twinrova, which is a bit silly. You can freeze Bongo Bongo's hands with them though, if you put off the Shadow Temple until then."

The kids you're supposed to be rescuing are pretty flat. Malo's funny because baby businessman but that's it.

Tears of Light collection gets really old really fast.

A fair number of dungeon items are barely used outside their dungeon. The Dominion Rod is the worst offender since its uses are all tied to the plot, meaning there's NO opportunity to explore with it.

Zant was really anticlimactic once he went crazy for his boss fight.

Ganondorf felt shoehorned in.

The overworld is very obviously broken up into different sections connected by narrow paths to disguise loading times.  It's also pretty big and empty.

The poe collecting sidequest is fine on its own, but there's no way to force the day/night cycle along so if you find one at dawn you're SOL for a while.

Now for the good:

The dungeons are some of my favorites in the series, except maybe the Forest Temple.

Likewise for the bosses, they had a few good ones.  (They also had a few bad ones though, so that's sort of a wash.)

The hidden sword skills are pretty badass.

Malo Mart is hilarious.

Midna is one of the best Zelda companions."
