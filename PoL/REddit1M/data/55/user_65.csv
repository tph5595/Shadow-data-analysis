15342,"I think you're hitting on a big part of the Twilight Princess problem: It favored spectacle in some very uneven ways. It tried really hard to look dark, but very rarely presented you with some psychologically chilling stuff, ala Majora's Mask. The bosses were phenomenal, but topped off largely boring dungeons. Everything was pretty but it had little to offer.

Twilight Princess's strength is the same as its weakness: It's an aesthetically-driven game. For some that sells it, and for others it's a deal breaker. For me, I thought that made it ""modern"" in all the wrong ways. Modern skill gaining system, modern ""gritty"" appeal, and modern intentions; the linear progression through a very pretty world. I liked the sword skills, too, it seemed like the first time anyone acknowledged Link as a swordsman. I just wish it had amounted to more."
