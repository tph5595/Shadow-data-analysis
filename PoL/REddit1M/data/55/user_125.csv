48510,"The thing is, I got Skyward Sword. I had heard so much bad about it but I was like ""nah it can't be that bad"" and I got into it, the intro was a bit slow like Twilight Princess but that was fine for me, but then the unthinkable happened... Fi was introduced. Fi is the absolutely most terrible character ever introduced in the Zelda universe, as bad as 100 Navis at the same time this little bitch would pop up and interrupt the gameplay every fucking minute! Often also locking progress until you heeded her fucking word. The pacing maybe would've been fine but taking a minute to talk to Fi every minute ruined it completely."
