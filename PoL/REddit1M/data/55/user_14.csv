4897,"I suggest you play some of the other Zelda games for comparison.

Basically, I hated the art of it in that everything was drab and dirty. And to cover up the fact that it was a Gamecube game they ported over to the Wii, they covered everything in way too much bloom. I honestly couldn't see half the things on the screen most of the time.

And the characters were kinda all bad. They have a lot of side characters you're supposed to care about, but really don't give you any reason to care. That doesn't happen in any other Zelda game.

Plus, the controls. The motion controls were cute, but... ugh.

Honestly, though, it's not all bad. It's not like it was Skyward Sword. Actually, the snow dungeon in TP may be my favorite Zelda dungeon of all time. And Midna was amazing. The part where she's sick? I really genuinely got upset and wanted to help her as soon as possible!

Plus, there was no exploration. It was very formulaic. You have to understand that Zelda games were, at their heart, entirely about exploration. This game, though, had none of that. There were very few sidequests and no real secrets and fun things to find out in the world. It was all so linear.

And let's not forget about the creepy nipple chickens.

No, if you want to see what a true Zelda game can be, you need to play A Link Between Worlds. It's such an incredibly polished example of everything Zelda games should be."

I acknowledge that the visuals were great (I love the redesign of Zelda herself and Groose) and the mechanics for the Sand Sea were pretty neat. Also the flying mechanics and the Lumpy Pumpkin were pretty great! But that was way too little in a pile of terrible drivel masquerading as a Zelda game. 

In addition to what Egoraptor mentioned in the video, the entire game seemed rushed and incomplete. Oh, you have to kill this annoying boss where you kill puss-filled toes? Great, hope you enjoy killing it three times! Oh, you enjoy exploring this area? Sure hope you enjoy exploring it again while playing an odd stealth game then again when some random mechanic has changed like it's flooded and you're collecting music notes for no adequately explained reason. They reused everything, well past the point of it being entertaining. 

There was no real world to explore, and everything was reused. In no other Zelda game do you literally have to walk through an empty dungeon you already beat.

I'm not going to talk about Fi because honestly there's a 87.5% chance she really didn't annoy me any more than Navi or Tatl did. I consider that a draw.

And the controls you mentioned. I'm not the best at video games, but I'm not bad at them. I can beat the crown level of Super Mario 3D World. And yet, I could not convince Link to not run randomly off edges. He controlled like an 18 wheeler. I swear, it was almost as if he wanted to be in the game less than I wanted to play it. Every time he even saw a ledge it's like he just ran toward it to his doom.

I also have a beef with the end boss because Fi specifically says you can't do the Skyward Strike in that realm, and it's the only way to beat the boss. That's what I get for listening to Fi.

Ultimately, there was no exploration, no freedrom, bad controls, and consistent reuse of everything. It had super neat moments like the sky whale and the lumpy pumpkin, but you had to go through the same annoying fight three times in order to get to those cool things, and throughout it all Link is by far the hardest part of the game, harder than any boss. By the time I'd gotten to the sand dungeon, the game had already lost me, and I could only help but think, ""Wow, this is kind of fun, I wonder if it will be fun when I have to come through here for the third time?"" Because that was the game's MO for most areas.

In many Zelda games, I always feel like what I'm doing helps my quest. I'm saving a sage, getting a magic crest, collecting the triforce, whatever. In this game, I always felt I was playing a particular level not because it helped my quest, but because the developers felt at this point I really needed to do a stealth game with no items, and then at this point they really felt I should be collecting music notes. There was no sense of connection or overarching purpose in literally anything you did.

In terms of 3D Zelda games, many have been far from perfect. But I never quit on Windwaker until I beat it. I always felt an urge to keep going, to save Hyrule. But by the the third time I had to fight the Imprisoned I literally said, ""Oh come on!"" turned off the game, and didn't pick it up for months.

And that, my friend, is the short version of my rant. Bet you regret asking me now (-:"
16773,"Well now we're off topic from the OP, but I do think you may want to watch the Sequelitis video again. For one thing, you seem to be taking it as a serious review, when it's a video that takes time to explain what ""Poopy castle"" means. Comedy is a big part of the video.

His points are seriously valid. I'm now rewatching it as I type. Link to the Past is basically like the first Zelda, only more like Disney Land, and a ton more content.

The 3D aspect of Ocarina of Time did introduce a lot of issues, which they solved with Z-Targeting, which was brilliant, but it does actually cause the disconnect he talks about. How many 3D games have used Z-targeting since then? That's pretty good evidence that it wasn't a fantastic idea, although honestly it was brilliant for its time.

Even as a kid, I also got the idea that 90% of the battles are ""wait, attack, wait, attack"" and how separated the fighting and exploration were. Though I didn't have the game design lingo I have now.

He never mentions that beating a bunch of dudes till a door opens is even a puzzle, that was him talking about how intense sudden combat is engaging. But looking around for an eye to shoot isn't engaging. The former is satisfying, and the simple puzzles of ""find the thing in the room you have to look at before the door opens"" is not satisfying.

Then he talks about how OoT handles suspense and item chests, and I will admit that's a pretty minor point, but his points about suspense and creating a dungeon narrative? Those are all 100% valid.

Then he kind of goes back to his main point. Keep in mind that this is talking about how OoT is as a sequel, not as a game in general. Zelda has always been a series about exploration. And as it goes on, it's getting more like Disney than the wilderness. And Ocarina of Time more than any other made it very linear, very formulaic. All the dungeons follow the same pattern. You solve a puzzle to get the item to let you into a dungeon, then you get to the miniboss then get the item you need for the rest of the dungeon, then kill the boss by using the new item on it three times.

Ocarina of Time was amazing. It was not perfect. Link Between Worlds improved upon it in so many ways. But what Ocarina of Time really did was that it removed the feeling of exploring caves, and changed the Zelda series dramatically. It would be like if they made a sequel to Tetris that played like a Final Fantasy. The sequel may be great, but unless it's a puzzle game about falling blocks, it's not a Tetris game.

I will ask you this. Have you played the original Zelda and Ocarina of Time? Do they play like the same game? Why or why not?"
18589,"Well, not shooters... I'm assuming you mean 3D melee combat. Except, not massive brawlers like Dynasty Warriors. The 3D melee combat with a small number of enemies.

According to the several lists I came up with, it seems like a bunch of Nintendo games use it, and the only other big names are Assassin's Creed and GTA. Like from this source: http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CameraLockOn

I don't know, I just couldn't think of any games I'd played with that mechanic. There definitely are some, but not that many."
