30452,"&gt; And, I disagree with people who say TP had no exploration. It certainly had more exploration than either OoT or MM. In addition to the overworld features seen in OoT and MM, there were at least a dozen caves (several of which were extremely long and winding with dozens of paths to explore)/spinner tracks/hookshot target paths/etc to discover that contained significant rewards (usually heart pieces).


You are seriously the first person, I've ever seen say this on the internet besides myself. I never understood why anyone would say Hyrule Field was empty in TP with all those hidden mini-dungeons, chests, grottoes and whatnot. There was so much stuff to do, that it seems to me that the majority of players didn't even try to find stuff. I think you had at least 2 or 3 of those bigger caves in each section of HF. 


I personally think TP was the best game in terms of exploration (out of the 3D games, I think either AlttP or Minish Cap is my overall #1)  Sure, Wind Waker had all those islands, but the majority of them were tiny and part of a set of isles with the same or similar puzzles/secrets, which is really the only gripe I had with that game. And Aonuma said it himself, Wind Waker was a ""faked open world"", in that sense it is actually even more sectioned than TP "
