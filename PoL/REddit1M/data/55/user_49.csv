I thought the game was very realistic, yes it was empty at parts but the dungeons were beautiful and the bosses (even though they were easy) they were epic."

I think more could have been added, but I think (from what I remember), the release date for TP was being delayed and maybe they had to cut production at a certain point and left things out? Who knows. However, from what i've been seeing from the Wii U version, the next game should be epic and have what TP missed in content of the game."
