While I enjoyed it more this time than I did the first time (back when it first came out), my biggest complaint was that all the wolf segments were incredibly tedious. Combat as a wolf was not fun. Following scent trails without being able to see anything else was not fun. Pressing the same button over and over again while Midna does all the platform jumping for you was not fun.

The segments where you actually play as Link were fine, though. And Arbiter's Grounds is one of my favourite Zelda dungeons."
