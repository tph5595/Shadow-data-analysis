28269,"I think you missed the idea. I feel like the reason for the few characters that make an impact is that you were supposed to see the desolation that the twilight realm's influence was causing and have a connection with the citizens of a slowly collapsing world. Being able to exist in the twilight while witnessing the panic in the masses let you sympathize with the people's whose entire lives were falling apart. Admittedly that led to a bit shallower of a connection with the individual characters (besides Midna, whose playful interactions were necessary to establish a meaningful tie to the twilight), but was an interesting turn on what you were fighting for. Just my understanding of the themes, and I'd love to hear what the rest of you think. "
