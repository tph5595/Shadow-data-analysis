15348,"That's because it *wasn't* terrible.  Zelda fans on Reddit tend to say really extreme things, but I'd say the general consensus is that all Zelda games are good, but some are better than others.

Also, I think people get pretty fixated on a single feature of Zelda games and let that drive their whole decision about whether a game is ""good"" or ""bad"".  For example, in most threads I've seen, the general consensus is that the temples and bosses in MM are among the worst in the series.  Yet many people say MM is their favorite because of the atmosphere and numerous side quests.

Personally, I value dungeons and exploration. I think TP had the absolute best dungeons in the series (the first five temples are all incredible).  And, I disagree with people who say TP had no exploration. It certainly had more exploration than either OoT or MM. In addition to the overworld features seen in OoT and MM, there were at least a dozen caves (several of which were extremely long and winding with dozens of paths to explore)/spinner tracks/hookshot target paths/etc to discover that contained significant rewards (usually heart pieces)."
