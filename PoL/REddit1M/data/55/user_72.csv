17198,Agreed. Taking few things and spreading them out as opposed to packing them densely together artificially lengthens playtime by making players hike to every point of interest. It's a cheap gimmick and it sucks.

No, game, fuck you. Just slip on the armor, wait for a bit, and the treasure is yours. That way, you never have to return to some godforsaken corner of a dungeon for a single chest (although this would never be a problem if we could just collect the treasure with a full wallet, like in previous games, but I digress).

Or when you know you're about to be in the shit up to your elbows (e.g. Cave of Ordeals, bosses, and mini-bosses), the armor lets you not have to rely on potions and fairies. In the Zelda franchise, money is useless anyway, so the totally OP armor is a good way of making the money valuable again.

Plus, it looks cool. In TP, you have a choice of boring, generic green tunic, or the ugly, impractical Zora Armor. This leaves Magic Armor as the only other option, so I look for every opportunity to put it on."
