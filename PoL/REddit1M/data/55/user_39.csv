10436,"I find that Skyward Sword is very hit or miss with people - people either loved it to death or they hate it

I loved it the first time through but I find that I don't have much desire to replay it, which is weird for a zelda game as I am constantly replaying them

I'm not sure what it is."
14552,"I'm not sure it's the controls, although that is admittedly part of it.

It's more... the terrible pacing of the first few dungeons. The game is awesome in the intro, but super boring for the first 2 dungeons. It gets pretty cool for the time changing ones and the few after that but it takes too long to get to the parts that I actually want to play."
14978,"That is fair for sure, I loved it the first time for that reason but the poor dungeons keep me from replaying it.

I do think the story of skyward sword is great!

Fi is terrible though... She actively told me answers to puzzles and reiterated everything way too much. A real letdown after Midna."
50510,Yeah! I think you hit the nail on the head there
50532,I thought groose was hilarious!
69575,"That's pretty true, although the majority of critiques I have for it are related to Fi and the first few dungeons"
81601,Good points! I hadn't considered it specifically that way before.
