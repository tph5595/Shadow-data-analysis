Those fucking kids (except Colin) suck. Those monkeys from the forest temple are annoying. Those skull kids from the forest grove can die in hell and burn forever. Also, the tear collecting portions of the game...really? Bleh idk until you get the Master Sword the game is pretty terrible."

For me, the first half of Twilight Princess is very hard to get through. In the second half you see the strengths that make the game great: the cooler items, the awesome dungeons, and more
Importantly the character development (I speak specifically of the relationship between Link and Midna)."
