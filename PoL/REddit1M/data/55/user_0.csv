0,Twilight Princess is the first zelda game I've played and my favorite game ever but a lot of people seem not to like it so I'm wondering what about it do people not like.
7655,Sure it didn't have as many hidden things as other games but I think it had a fair share
8499,Really? Midna is definitely the best helper to me. Unlike the others she actually had a personality.
8991,"I agree the wolf parts could get annoying but there weren't THAT many of them, but seriously, Arbiter's grounds is the best dungeon in any game."
9566,Well I've played others and Like it more than them. Of course I wasn't disappointed with them but I still thought TP was better.
11388,Oh. Well I don't think she's bad.
