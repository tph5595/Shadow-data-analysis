13432,"I agree with a lot of this, but one of the worst things for me is that the game takes too long to do things that don't matter.  There are so many useless cutscenes.  For example, every time you battle a dungeon boss, there is a cutscene that feels like it takes forever right before the battle.  That alone isn't a big deal, but the game continuously does things like this and it adds up.  The part of the game I hate doing the most is collecting tears.  Who cares about tears?  There is no reason that needs to be in the game.  And there's that mailman guy interrupting what I'm doing.  And the letters are just advertisements.  At the beginning of the game, you have to herd goats for no reason.  Is this game a fucking chore simulator?  I don't think so.

But it's still somehow fun to play for the most part, just not the best in the series."
