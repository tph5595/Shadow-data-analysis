even if its only in the desert or something. speeding around would have been so much fun."

When I finally got around to replaying it had almost no replay-ability and was a chore to get to where i was. And I really didnt want it to feel that way so I waited a long time. Around a year. I dredged through just for the sick boss fight at the end. Honestly If all the fights in that game were like the final boss it would have been awesome. Like if you learned techniques from something similar to the wolf. would have made all the monotonous combat versus those fucking shock rod assholes so much better. Like introduce an enemy whos annoying to kill but then learn a technique which allows you to kill him with ease. Maybe something similar to the sword techniques in red steel 2. I dunno I just hated playing through all that shit to get to that one really fun fight. Really wish it was funner replaying. "
37084,Those are a bit different. Those are a much more polished version where you click once then done as opposed to holding Z the entire time. Though you are right almost all hack and slashes use them.

It somehow breaks the code that initiates when you fall into the other areas, meaning it doesn't initiate the changes in the areas such as the mountain sneak mission or forest floodng."
