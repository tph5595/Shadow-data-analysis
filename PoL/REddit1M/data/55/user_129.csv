Those guys you save you are saving because you're a hero and you *should* save them, not because they are the key to defeating Ganondorf or they have huge helpful dialogue. It's normal for a whole Zelda game to focus on maybe 3 characters 99% of the time. "

The combat was by far the best too in my opinion because it was the first time so much thinking was required before sword strikes. Ghirahim was a brilliant boss in every fight with him. The story was wonderful, and Zelda was a wonderful looming figure to have as motivation to keep going. The art style is arguably the best, and it's the coolest Link has ever looked for me. There are tons of reasons to love SS, and also tons of reasons to hate it that you can focus on if you choose to (empty sky world, little done with flight mechanic, dowsing being pointless, amber relics!, Phi being too helpful, a plot hole with the time traveling, etc.). 

It really comes down to what people choose to focus on. It can very easily be seen as the best Zelda game or one of the worst. "

I think the best way to handle the Zelda series is to make a world with enough content such that once in a while, while exploring, you find something interesting that makes you a bit less lonely and makes you want to explore more. But at the same time not overdoing it, to keep those things you find feeling mysterious and well-worked for. Pacing the world, basically. 

Exploration seems to be a huge focus on the next big Zelda and I'm REALLY excited for it. "
