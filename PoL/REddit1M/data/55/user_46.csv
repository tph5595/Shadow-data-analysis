Holy crap that was the worst part of the game, by far.

The ridiculously easy game got even easier when you learned the hidden skills. The one hit ko move made destroying medium strength enemies a joke. The backslice made enemies such as ganondorf and the darknuts boringly easy. Yes, I know, you can just not use them. That's not the point.

The best part of the game though was the cave of ordeals."
