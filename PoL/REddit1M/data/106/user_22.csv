Even compared to The Wind Waker(which is my favorite Zelda game to this day) Twilight Princess was a major disappointment.  The visuals were dark and muddy, the plot was predictable, Zant was a waste of a villain, and the wolf sections were atrocious.  I think I would have enjoyed the game better had Ganondorf not been in it though.  Zant was so cool to me until ol' Ganon came in.

While the game isn't my favorite, there are some things I really enjoy about it.  The soundtrack is amazing, Midna was a companion done right (Like the King of Red Lions, but not still not as great imo) and the dungeons are some of my favorites in all of the games. 

 I personally didn't feel a connection between Link and Ilia.  She's probably the most wooden character Nintendo's ever written.  We learn almost nothing about her during the entire time we are trying to save her.  I think Link had a better connection with Midna than he did with Ilia or any of the other kids.

I think Nintendo tried too hard to recreate the success of Ocarina of Time.  The game hasn't aged well either, visually speaking.  That's just my nitpicks.  If you enjoy the game, that's all that matters.  It's still a fun game too, I just think things could have been done a little better.  And they've definitely improved in later games since then."

OOT, MM, and TP are just the three Zelda games I feel haven't aged well, or are starting to show their age.  I think OOT and MM are more of a case of just showing their age, and not aging bad or anything like that, if that makes any sense.  Like how Twilight Princess is only 8 years old, but it just doesn't look as good as it could be.  That's just me though.  "

I recent replayed the game, and noticed how it tackled the Zelda/Link/Ganondorf trilogy.  WW Link is just a kid who had his sister kidnapped, and he's thrown into this old fight between the king and Ganondorf, along with Zelda.  and at the end (Spoilers) Hyrule floods, and Link's ""link"" with fate is broken, freeing him from the typical destiny between the three characters.  These kids keep being thrown into this fight between the goddesses and evil (Demise or Ganondorf, whichever) and Wind Waker was a way of freeing them from something they shouldn't have to be a part of.

Nintendo has been doing the Link/Zelda/Ganondorf business for a while now, and I think that Wind Waker addressed the whole thing perfectly.  The king told Link to live his life in a new land, instead of Hyrule.  I've been getting bored of the Zelda formula for a while, but I feel like The Wind Waker was the best response to doing away with the whole conventions that Zelda has fallen into.  Might also be why they remade Wind Waker before Zelda U.

That was a big ramble, and it probably made no sense lol  Just some thoughts I had after replaying The Wind Waker."
