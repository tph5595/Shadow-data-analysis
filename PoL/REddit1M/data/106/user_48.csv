This game sucks. A lot. The graphics are easy on the eyes because there's nothing to look at. The controls are fucking terrible. Coming from someone who grew up playing SNES and 64 games, the Wii mote was the worst idea Nintendo ever had and ultimately made the game unplayable for me. 

I love Zelda. I love every Zelda title I've ever played, except this one and the weird DS game with the trains. TP was such a huge letdown. After OoT, after Majora's Mask, especially after Windwaker.

0/10, will never, ever play that trainwreck of a game again. "
