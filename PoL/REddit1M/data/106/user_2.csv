1563,"My experience with Twilight Princess made it my favorite one of all time. The story pulled me in, characters were charming and well done, the music was well done and memorable for me. This Zelda game is one that any person interested in playing the series should play, it has  some of the best level design (dungeon layouts, Hyrule field, etc, etc.) in all the games I have played (I played *A LOT* of Skyrim, Zelda Majoras Mask, Ocarina of Time, Oblivion, and many more) amazing boss fights, and many mini games that had me hooked. This is a Zelda game that gives me the most memories (got it in November of 2006, when I was 10). These are some of the reasons I love Zelda TP, and hope for a HD remake for the Wii U in the future. I advise anyone who hasn't played TP or a Zelda game in general, to play this one, it will open the gateway to you playing other Zelda titles like it did to me."
