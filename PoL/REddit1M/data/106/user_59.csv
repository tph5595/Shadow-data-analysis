33241,"My half brother and I are 16 years apart. I grew up on video games and currently so is he. We'd run Super Mario Bros/Galaxy/Kart, Donkey Kong, Kirby's Epic Yarn and Smash sometimes; but most above all, both he and I cherished our time spent playing Zelda together. After thoroughly playing OOT, WW and SW with him, TP was the Zelda game he liked the most and would always ask me to do the last boss fight as he watched in awe. I never really realized how much it meant/means to him and probably thousands of other players too until this post. He's a little older now and has moved on to other games on Xbox, but sometime soon I think it will be my turn to bug him to share a run through TP again. :)"
