48708,You have no idea how good it feels to for once see so many people praise TP. Everywhere I go people always insult the hell out of it. I dont understand why it was the most horribly received Zelda game yes it does have flaws and I will admit its not one of the best Zelda games but its not a bad game. Theres no such thing as a bad official Zelda game.
48768,I hate Zelda fans so much.
48875,Your the kind of person who would say MGS5 looks like Atari.
48964,TOO MUCH CREDIT? Your fucking psychotic it was the most poorly received Zelda game ever unjustifiably so.

They're behavior is what has practically ruined the series for me to where I cant call myself a fan anymore despite loving the series it makes me sick to have to be paired up with them.
172838,Because its still a good game that deserves better respect and needs to stop being pointlessly insulted by assholes like you.
