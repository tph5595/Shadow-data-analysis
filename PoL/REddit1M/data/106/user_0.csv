0,"Now, just to clear things up, I'm not much of a video gamer. I don't really play COD or FIFA, or World of Warcraft or anything that most gamers are into. I guess I've played a few Super Mario numbers, some old Pokémon, Kirby and other Gameboy games, a bit of assassin's creed on Xbox, as well as Skyrim, and some Lego games. Oh, and I can't forget Runescape, haha.

You can probably tell from the randomness of the list that I don't know much about games. Yeah, I prefer a bit of chess and sport.

Anyway, back in 2008, when I was about 10 years old, I got Legend of Zelda Twilight Princess on Nintendo Wii. The only other Zelda game I'd ever played was A Link to the Past and a bit of Majora's Mask, and I had found those ones quite good so I was expecting this to be similar. 

I had this thing about Zelda games - the characters and the plots kind of stay in your thoughts after you've finished the games. You don't get that with Call of Duty or Super Mario. I felt the same connection with Twilight Princess - but multiplied by at least thousand.

The first thing that struck me about the game was the quality.
The sounds were so ambient, the village music was so soothing, and the graphics were gentle on the eyes. The controls were very comfortable too. 

But that's beside the point.

You see, Twilight Princess has stayed in my thoughts ever since 2008. It's just such a lovely, artistic, dreamy bit of work by Nintendo.
The first time I played the storyline through, I was not sure exactly what was making this game such a great part of my afterschool routine (I played at least one hour as soon as I got home - *sighs* those young and carefree days). 

Back then, I was just awed by the bow and arrow's range, the sword skills, the bustling Castle Town, the blue expanse of Lake Hylia, the mysterious Gerudo desert, the cosy Snowpeak Mansion, and the sheer depth of extra detail in every Town, Temple, Castle and Field and minigame. 

Furthermore, the Link in this game was not a little boy with a high-pitched voice. He was at least 17 or something, and way more grownup. 

As I was a boy, I was also enthralled by the combat: sniping down the bulblins was awesome, as were the screaming skeletons in the desert temple. I used to think some enemies were epic too, like the shadow beasts - they were just so twisted and demonic and vicious! The darknuts were probably the biggest, most devastating tanks ever in any Zelda game, and the final showdown with Ganondorf was, frankly, formidable. Those were good times...

I was about 14 when I replayed the whole game again. It was summer, puberty had started to kick in, hormones and deep emotions were on the go, and I was now old enough to appreciate the more sentimental aspects of the storyline. 

The relationships between Link and the various characters - from Fado the shepherd and Mayor Bo, all the way to Midna and Princess Zelda - felt so genuine that I actually felt these people existed somewhere, someplace, sometime.

I don't want to sound soppy, but I was genuinely touched by the gentle romance between Link and Ilia throughout the game. When I first played the game, the scenes with the two of them used to bore me, but this time I paid attention to the warm expressions in those animated blue and green eyes, really soaking up the feeling. And I'm sorry, on the outside I try to keep up a hard façade, but the scene where Ilia regains her memory made me cry inside.

This time, I was also aware of the villainous personalities of Zant and Ganondorf, and was genuinely eager to finish them off - especially Ganondorf after the cutscenes which showed what he had done to Princess Zelda. The hostility between Midna and these two villains is also very deep. You really see her loathe and struggle against the two bigger and more powerful *male* fiends.
The feeling of triumph when Link stabs the master sword into Ganondorf at the game's end gives you such a rush. And Ganondorf's bitter final speech literally gave me goosebumps.

And I cannot forget to mention the ending credits, and the scene where Midna, restored to her tall and stately true form, must return forever to the twilight. Link's facial expressions in that are heart-rending.

I used to dream about the characters and the story and the places in the gameworld - haha. Kind of sad really, but I guess the game has had that effect on other people. 

The game is just so deep. I cannot express it in words, really. I congratulate the game makers, for producing such a beautiful world and storyline. There are some Japanese geniuses who I presume are alive right now, somewhere in the far east, who created this beauty. I thank them for enriching my youth.

Playing the game made me feel as though the events in the game were actually happening in some alternative universe. And, to be completely honest with you fellow Zelda fans, I often wish they really were.

2000,"The game quality is one thing that was pretty ground-breaking, but for me, the storyline is what got me hooked, and even though I'm not into games, I think if I ever have kids, I'll recommend them this game (but it'll probably be way outdated by then, haha)
"
2489,I agree haha
2534,oh the nostalgia if that actually happened XD

6503,them feelz
7453,...and not all games can have that emotional affect on the gamer - which is why TP might be one of the best games ever made. I'd definitely rate it higher than some of IGN's top-rated numbers.
