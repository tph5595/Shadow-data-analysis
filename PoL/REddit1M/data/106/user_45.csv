27992,"When I finished Twilight princess for the first time, I felt like something was taken from me and I felt empty for a number of days because that game was so EPIC and filled to the brim with interesting characters, environments, and gameplay mechanics. I love all zelda games, but twilight princess will always be my favorite game. It definitely influenced the person I am today. Since I found the game to be easy after the second playthrough, I did things like not collect all the heart containers and bottles to make it more challenging. there is no game I can think of that can compare to the bosses and their scope. arbiter's grounds to this day is the best area/dungeon in any video game ive played...god i love this game"
