36749,Can't each game be reviewed on its own merit? What's to stop the latest Call of Duty from being great if it's your first time with the series?
37010,"&gt;after hearing about how dangerous and devastated the surface was its real confusing when it then shows really bright green colors the first time you go there

I agree with all the complaints except this one. All they have to go on are stories from long ago about how it was dangerous down there so the goddess saved some people by putting a chunk of land of into the sky. It makes sense that after living in the sky for so long, so they have no idea what the surface is like. And to be fair, it is more dangerous down there than it is up in Skyloft."
