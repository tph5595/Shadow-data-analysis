The game I grew up with and dreamed about like you did as a child was Link's Awakening when I got it back in '94 (7yo), so I like to think that my love for TP (frankly the best Zelda title ever made imo) isn't based on nostalgia, but its quality. Damn you care about the characters!! The kids, Midna, even that fat woman in the town. I remember the epicness of the bridge joust and carriage protecting scene the first playthrough- I was blown away! And the wild west music that plays when you're sniping in the Gerudo town with the bow and arrow, and making the soup.. There are just so many moments that stay with you that are found between dungeons unlike in the earlier games where you pretty much linearly head to the next dungeon. And the music and graphics are just stunning. I love thecrealism of this title compared to the artistic style of Phantom Hourglass/WW.

A lot of people criticize TP for being dumbed down and easy, but I wonder if this is because the internet and ign guide websites were widely accessed by the time of its release in 2006 iirc. When OoT first came out you were on your own figuring it out, but now you can google the solution in seconds with the smartphone in your pocket. I remember being stuck at Link's Awakening for weeks at a time because there was noone to ask (and I was a dumb kid), but even with my years of experience having played most titles, I still got stumped a couple of times already in my 4th TP run this week.

Tl;dr: TP is the best Zelda game."

You get to know the villagers and the kids, and I quite like how you help them out. I don't consider it the tutorial, just part of the story of Link's life before he finds out he's the Hero."

29701,"The plot was predictable? The wolf sections were attrocious? Really?! Sneaking around as a wolf breaking into houses, talking to animals and following scents were the best parts! And there are so many side stories and little moments that happen, how can you call it overall 'predictable'? Or do you mean the story of 'you must go to the dungeons to collect the --- pieces' because that's the staple of all games, of course it's predictable.

You sure you played TP?"
