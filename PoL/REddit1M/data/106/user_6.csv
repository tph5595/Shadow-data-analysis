3917,"Our opinions of Twilight Princess differ greatly, but regardless, this was very well written.

If you haven't already, I suggest giving Wind Waker a try. I'd love to see your thoughts on that."
6741,"I'm the opposite. Twilight Princess is alright and everything, but there were too many plot related problems that I had with it. Wind Waker, on the other hand, had me invested from the outset (teehee), and it's easily the most enjoyable Zelda experience, at least to me."
24716,"Actually thinking about it, a lot of my problems weren't exactly plot focused, but here's what could be considered plot issues that I had.

I personally don't have a problem with Ganondorf being in the game, but they shouldn't have introduced him the way they did. It seemed like his inclusion was rather forced.

Zant's fall into madness was a great idea, but it happened way too suddenly. In every scene we see of him throughout the game, he seems calm and serious, almost emotionless even, but at the end of the game, all of that is thrown out the window. It would have been more effective if they spaced out his fall to madness a bit more. Like, at first, we see Zant how he normally is. The next time we see him, he should be a bit angrier. The next time, even angrier. His stern personality breaks more and more with each time we seem to best him. That way, when we see him go crazy at the end, it seems more believable.

No one in castle town reacts when Hyrule Castle becomes encased in the large barrier. You'd figure at least someone around town would be like ""Hey, some barrier thing appeared around the castle. I wonder what that is about."" But no, not a single person has anything to say about it, positive or negative.

Around the half way point of the game, Midna is nearly killed by Zant, and Link has to take her to Zelda. Zelda heals Midna, but by doing so evaporates into the air. I believe Midna refers to this as Zelda's Sacrifice. Okay, so Zelda sacrifices her life to save Midna, but after you defeat Zant, Midna tells you that Zelda is in Hyrule Castle, and you need to save her. How did Ganon trap her though? Didn't we watch her disappear into thin air? Maybe the game was trying to make you feel like there were larger forces at work, but it certainly didn't seem that way to me. If Ganondorf somehow explained how he got Zelda's body back, I would have been satisfied, but at this point, it's completely up to the player to fill in the blanks.

Most of my other problems are not as plot focused, but I can list those too if you're interested."
25325,"They made Ganondorf into a tragic villain in Wind Waker, and it was a great contrast to how he is nothing but power hungry in other games, not that he isn't power hungry in WW, but still."
32245,"I refuse to believe that this would be how the situation would realistically play out. I understand that this is a video game, with a somewhat unrealistic setting, but a certain level of realism is still expected. If a weird barrier suddenly formed around the White House, you'd have people rushing to inspect it, people freaking out, mass paranoia, etc. The same should happen when Hyrule Castle deals with the same situation.

I don't know, it just doesn't seem right that not a single person in town seems to notice it."
45111,"Yup, Ghirahim was handled in a similar fashion as Zant, but I felt with much better results."
52467,"I don't hate Twilight Princess, far from it, actually. I just find more things that I don't like about that game than I do with any of the other 3D Zelda games.

And while Wind Waker is my favorite video game ever, I'd be a fool to call it perfect."
