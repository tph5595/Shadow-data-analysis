46897,I agree completely! There is just something so unique about it that sticks with you.. I was about that age when I first played it and now looking back I realized how much the plot and characters stuck with me. When it showed zant take over the castle for the first time I knew it wasn't going to be a normal zelda game. It seemed more real and dark. Midnas lament literally stirred something emotional in me. I can go on and on about notable memories from that game that effected me a lot
