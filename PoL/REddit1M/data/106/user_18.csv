Midna's attitude, plight, and anger make her a fantastic sidekick, Zelda's selflessness really tugs at the heartstrings, Link's humble beginnings as a farm boy make his rise to a powerful young man all the more amazing.

I'm currently at the end of Skyward Sword, and while I have some complaints (I'm not such a fan of the graphics, it seems a little cartoony for my taste, the dungeon setup wasn't what I thought it would be), I think it, too, does a great job in including emotion. The relationship between Zelda and Link, how it changes when Zelda truly understands herself, how she actually apologizes for using him... I admit, I was really high when I watched that cut scene, but I think I would have teared up anyway.

That, I think, is what draws so many people to these games. It combines interesting gameplay that has a balance of brawn and intelligence, with a heart-felt story that takes place in a strange and beautiful world.

Here's to hoping that the new game makes me cry."

The visuals in TP are definitely conducive with being stoned. The Twilight realm is very pretty (who else loves that gorgeous glowing cyan linework?), and much of the rest of the game has a very nice earthy aesthetic. Also, the motion controls are fun; same with Skyward Sword.

Other fun, casual games to play while high: Katamari Damacy, The New Super Mario Bros., Dokapon Kingdom (which is a relatively unknown but super underrated game), Portal 2 multiplayer, Mariokart... probably some others I'm not thinking of."
