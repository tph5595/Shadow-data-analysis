I gave it a second shot around 2010ish because there were things I generally enjoyed.  The temples thselves were pretty spot on and I loved the variety.  Traversing the many locales like Zora's Domain, Snowpeak, Death Mountain, etc was so much fun.  But I barely got passed the first temple when I was yet again forced into becoming the wolf (probably my least favorite game mechanic in the whole series), and I just couldn't go on.  The ruppee thing is one thing.  But the massive amount of time spent having your hand held at the beginning, and the massive amount of time between puzzle solving you have to play through searching for shit, playing without your items, in that ugly dark world, hardly interacting with anyone, is just god awful.

It sucks, because I really would have liked to play through to see Snowpeak and Zora's Domain again, but I would much rather spend my (now pretty limited) time playing things I actually have fun with."
