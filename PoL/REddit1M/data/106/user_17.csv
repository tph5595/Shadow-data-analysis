10327,"midna has always been the best side-kick in my mind

the game is great but not free of complaints, like the game constantly reminding you what blue and yellow rupees are

and some of the items were poorly designed and were only useful in their predetermined locations in the world or quickly became obsolete (looking at you Spinner and slingshot!)

if not for issues like that the game would have been perfect"
14916,"yes, one of several reasons why i don't think i will ever replay that game"
16829,"dowsing was a dumb crutch mechanic (i actually could write a small article about why dowsing and quest markers promote lazy design) that i quickly stopped using all together except for finding the invisible ship (and i tried for a long time without it then), the hint stone is dumb crutch, the aforementioned rupee issue multiplied by those crafting items, the crafting system wasn't good (farming for ingredients is the worst for that kind of game), abandoning real time day/night cycle, the idea behind Fi's character was fine but giving percents when we all know its certain is dumb, the world felt so small or disjointed, and the overworld traveling by loftwing was sub-par, ""thank-you Link, but our princess is in another castle"" wasn't that good for most of the plot, oh, and after hearing about how dangerous and devastated the surface was its real confusing when it then shows really bright green colors the first time you go there

thats about all the bad stuff i can think of right now, i did like some of the boss fights and the motion controls that finally delivered the experience i anticipated when the Wii first came out"
20815,"did you not see me list more reasons below? or fail to comprehend the meaning of ""one of *several*""?

see you completely missed the point, because twilight princess does have that but i am replaying that game right now actually"
22957,i would be tempted to consider IGN's numbers garbage if they consistently rate COD highly despite them remaking the same game over and over
23063,i would like to hear what these plot related problems are because i consider TP's plot to be the best
32759,i seem to be one of the few people that was satisfied with the motion controls if not the game as a whole
33177,"yes there do seem to be some plot holes and areas that could be improved, but now that i think about it i wonder if i'm less critical of plot in video games than other media. maybe when i look at the plot of video games i look to just make sure it is no worse than its predecessor with some improvements in general. which i think TP delivered in terms of succeeding wind waker. i suppose the thing i actually really like about TP is the characters like Midna even if i lump that into talking about the plot"
