20139,"The fact that they remind you how much a rupee is worth is enough to make you never play the game again? Okay.

That's like saying ""I will NEVER go to Disneyland again because Dumbo was painted the wrong shade of grey on the Dumbo ride"""

It really makes it feel like an epic saga by the end and it's so much more satisfying.  Fantastic game, I echo yours and the OP's sentiments. However I have never cried at a video game &amp; I doubt I ever will. But that's just me, I have a heart of stone."

However anytime there is a supernatural element (Zombies in TWD, &amp; Zelda clearly set in a fantasy land) it brings the emotion out of it for me. I still enjoy it and the plot is my favorite part of some games, I just can't get so invested where I find myself welling up. I have yet to try The Last of Us though. Perhaps that will do it.

One movie I definitely teared up was ""Life Is Beautiful"" however. Probably because it had a *very* real element to it."
