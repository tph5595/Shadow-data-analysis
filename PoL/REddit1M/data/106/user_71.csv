I asked her about her Wii and what her favorite game was on it. She said Zelda. It was Twilight Princess, one of the few I hadn't played yet. So we continued to hang out after that and played it together.

It was one of the best moments of my life, especially when we both participated in beating Ganondorf at the end."
