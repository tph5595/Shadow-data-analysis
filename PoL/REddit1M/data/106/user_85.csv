51619,I gotta disagree. I'd love to discuss it more though because I've tried several times to like TP. I just find all the character interactions hollow. I can't see any depth in Midna and the plot seems totally lacking to me. I just don't get why it's so polarizing. It should be my favorite Zelda game but something is just wrong and idk what it is. 
51724,I've tried 3 full playthroughs and it feels hollow and gimmicky every time... What do? 4th? What am I missing? 
51763,I hate TP too lol. Windwaker is the perfect game. 
52196,"Yep. I have tried 3 full gameplays to like this game. I don't like Midna,  I hate the wolf, the plot makes very little sense, the characters are hollow, the music is mostly forgettable, the world traversal its gimmicky, hyrule field is empty. I like the arbiters grounds...  That's it. And I'm really tired of having to walk on eggshells when criticising this game. There are a few amazing parts... There are an overwhelming number of negative issues to cover them up."
106845,Yeah I've beaten it three times. I just really don't like Midna at all. The kids plot didn't make sense why they didn't just take them home right away and I did not understand at all why Ilia lost her memory. Idk. I'll try again someday but I really don't like any of the side characters if I'm honest.
