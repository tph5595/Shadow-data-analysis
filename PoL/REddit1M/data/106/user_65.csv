36841,"&gt;the plots kind of stay in your thoughts after you've finished....

That's why i watch anime.


I got the game on christmas 2007 along with the wii. I was in 7th grade... I loved the game, but it was dark, i was scared at certain parts. I always ran from some enemies or just spaz out, like the honking twilight pterodactyl bird thing in Hyrule field. It took me like 3 -4 years to beat it. I stopped playing the story when I got to the twilight realm and had to get the two light spheres.

Eventually i beat it. My uncle had the game also. I used to play around on Ocarina of Time at his house on his N64. He used to help me when he came over, he helped me when i was stuck on the volcano dungeon . 

I remember the days when i would come home from school, it would be sunny out(i live in Florida), it would be just me home for a little bit, and i would play, make some progress, it felt great. Then i would watch tv once it got dark out. 

When i beat it, i thought about the game for awhile. I would go on YouTube and watch videos of it, easter eggs and all. I would always wonder if Link will ever see Midna again, and how come no recognizes all of Links effort. 

I used to watch a lot of Lets Play's and CoD videos on YT. I loved when people did Twilight Princess..i think 2 different people im subbed too did it. I also remember reading the updates and rumors about the new Zelda game coming out, Skyward Sword. Then it came out, it was like crack to me...the guy finished, had the same affect TP did."
