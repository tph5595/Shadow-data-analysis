41053,"If you loved diving into the characters in twilight princess i recommend the deus ex games and the far cry games besides the first one. There is so much to do with side quests and characters, and your actions affect your relationship with NPCs and the events of the game. It's pretty easy to get lost in those worlds too. 

Still a loyal zelda fan though. I used to hate first person shooters, but Deus Ex and Far Cry changed my mind. Give me a shot if you've got the time/money"
