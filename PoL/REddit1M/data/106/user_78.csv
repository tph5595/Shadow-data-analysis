Sounds like Ghirahim. I also agree with the introduction to Ganon, he seemed to have come out of nowhere. You couldn't invest in his evilness because he hardly did a thing in the game. Zant was a foreboding character until he went ape shit.

I wish Nintendo would make another dark Zelda game that doesn't belittle the enemies, and that makes the bosses absolutely terrifying."
