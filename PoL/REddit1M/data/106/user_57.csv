32360,"I agree, the game is far from perfect. Towards the end, the story feels very rushed, and some aspects behind tedious sometimes (ahem, gathering light bug things, ahem). Though I don't think it's technically the most well made Zelda game, it's my favorite one. I guess it's because it's the first one I finished, but it holds a special place in my heart. "
