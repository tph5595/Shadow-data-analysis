9991,"I hated Twilight Princess the first time I played it, it was the first Zelda game I got and the start was so boring, but I was determined to get into Zelda so I played some of the others. I recently (last week) replayed it after playing through all of Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker, Skyward Sword, A Link Between Worlds, and partly playing through Majora's Mask and Link's Awakening, and I can now safely say it's in my top 5, if not my top 3. I really enjoyed that game after replaying it. If anyone else gave up on TP, try it again. "
