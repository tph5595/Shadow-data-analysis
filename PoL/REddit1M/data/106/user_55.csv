31163,"You've just described, in vivid detail, the months I spent playing through Twilight Princess the first few times. It sounds like I'm roughly the same age as you and the effect of remembering all the small things along the massive storyline in the game brings forth emotions I haven't really felt in games in a long while. I guess it's time to save for a WiiU and Skyward Sword. Anywho, thanks for the post and the nostalgia of many splendid months. "
