15886,"I understand. I got myself one. But I'm still looking out for a friend who wants one. He works nights and sleeps all day so he doesn't have chance to stake out these upcoming preorders.

I would suggest going at launch to get one, if successful, you can then sell the preorder to a friend after it ships. Or return it"
