There's also the Source (I hate them, but they DO sell video games.)  I think they take pre-orders, but I don't know if they get limited edition stuff.

Edit:  Toys R Us doesn't have any systems listed other than the 2DS and The Source only has the regular 3DS/3DS XL/2DS systems listed.  Nothing to see here."
5968,"As an aside, Do you think that Nintendo themselves are really going to take pre-orders?  I assumed that their site would just link to Best Buy and Future Shop when their pre-orders go up, as they don't normally sell new games/systems directly, just refurbs."

11532,It would be nice if these were region free like the Gameboy line and original DS...
13408,"3 systems does not necessarily a scalper make.  I believe that you were just looking out for your friend and SO.  If you bought more than that, I'd be suspicious.

Everyone (myself included) are just on edge about scalpers right now because of the amiibo, GC adapter and MM LE fiascoes."
14639,Still nothing...
15276,It's possible that we may see a repeat of the MM LE bundle last week.  It'll pop up randomly a little after 4PM EST when it was expected around noon.
15715,"Thanks for the update!  1 PM it is! (for us in EST.)

Apparently Future Shop tweeted the same info:

16610,STILL Nothing... This is killing me!
