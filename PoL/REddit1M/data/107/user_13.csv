12637,"The system for organizing/accessing order status seems to be down right now, which is freaking me out so out of the three I ordered for myself and my SO and friend, I could have anywhere between 1 and 3 canceled.

 I'd advise people who ordered multiple for the same reason I did to call now and at least get a shipping address changed because they'll cross-reference those according to the rep I talked with. I changed one of my addresses after seeing one order got canceled to hopefully ensure I'll still get two. 

Good luck :("

I appreciate your sympathy. Everyone on /r/nintendo is assuming that I'm just a scalper too. "
