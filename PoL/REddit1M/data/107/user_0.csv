0,"Welcome back everyone, sorry for not being able to be there a little sooner. 

My watch begins right now, I'll be refreshing every Canadian websites as of right now like I did yesterday but mostly Future Shop and Best Buy as we received a confirmation by a Best Buy rep yesterday that it would go like (Check [here](http://plug-in.bestbuy.ca/t5/Video-Gaming/New-3ds-XL/td-p/109139/page/3) for reference)

1. Link to Future Shop - [Here](http://www.futureshop.ca/Search/SearchResults.aspx?type=product&amp;page=1&amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;sortDir=desc&amp;filter=status0enrchstring%253aPreorder&amp;query=New+Nintendo+3DS+XL)
1. Link to Best Buy - [Here](http://www.bestbuy.ca/Search/SearchResults.aspx?type=product&amp;page=1&amp;sortBy=relevance&amp;sortDir=desc&amp;filter=status0enrchstring%253aPreorder&amp;query=new+3ds+xl)

(Note that these two links only look for available pre-orders for 3DS, I do not have the direct link to the new 3DS - Zelda Limited Edition yet.

There will be a limit of 3 systems per order so this means that scalpers can take advantage of the situations, be quick and ready brothers and sisters.

My estimation are that the system will go on sale sometime around 12:00PM EST / 9:00AM PST like the standard edition did on both website yesterday.

* **Update #1** - As of right now 8:25AM EST (5:25AM PST) I have not yet seen it show up on any of the two website, but I've heard it showed up during the night from fellows redditors in my previous thread. 

* **Update #2** - According to a forum post on BestBuy.ca, User [majorasmask](http://plug-in.bestbuy.ca/t5/Video-Gaming/New-3ds-XL/td-p/109139/page/14) posted the following statement:
''After a lenghty call to customer service and speaking with a manager/supervisor, they finally were able to confirm that it will be posted to the website **at 2:30pm EST**.  Best to show up a couple mins before just in case. Good luck all!!''  I would still watch out just incase.

* **Update #3** - Future Shop Twitter confirmation! [Here](https://twitter.com/FS_Gamer)

* **Update #4** - BestBuy says there's a delay [Link](https://twitter.com/BBYC_GamersClub/status/556152331734376449)

* **Update #5** - GO NOW, they are available for pre-order on both sites RIGHT NOW! 
[BestBuy](http://www.bestbuy.ca/en-CA/product/new-nintendo-3ds-xl-majora-s-mask-edition/10360985.aspx?path=176b9ec7ba5823088c92c071b96c89dcen02) [Future Shop](http://www.futureshop.ca/en-CA/product/new-nintendo-3ds-xl-majora-s-mask-edition/10360985.aspx?path=841d8947aeee51e1b37f16ce511c6ed2en02&amp;lang=fr-CA&amp;pcname=&amp;sku=10360985) There's a limit of 1 console per household compared to the limit of 3 the US had.

* **Update #6** - SOLD OUT ON BOTH SITES IN 10MINUTES

* **Update #7** - If you didn't get one, keep refreshing both sites, some of them get released after some times if the order don't go through or if people tried to buy more than the limit, there's still hope!
Last refresh at 14:00PM EST - There was 2 available at best buy keep looking!

As usual, good luck to every fellow zelda fans who wish to get their hands on this special limited edition!

**Edit** - Well, Good job everyone, I hope most people in this thread managed to get one! With this, my watch is now over and I can finally go to sleep. “Whenever there is a meeting, a parting is sure to follow. But that parting needs not last forever. Whether a parting be forever or merely for a short while… that is up to you.” See you all next month in Termina!

555,"Perfect, thank you. 
At least, this proves that it is now in their database and ready to show up anytime, the 404s simply means that they are not ready to sell it as of right now, but the inconsistencies with it going up and down is different from yesterday which mean something might go differently, so I would suggest to be vigilant."
1077,"Most of them don't ship to the US and are therefore only available to Canadian adress only, same as most of the US websites, they don't ship to Canada. (at least, when they have a Canadian franchise already)

I managed to reach the pre-order page for it on both the US version of Gamestop and BestBuy so far and both wouldn't ship to Canada.

(edit) As I seem to not have answered the right question in the first place, yes Canada is part of North America and is on the same region lock as the US console wise."
1401,"Added temporary links to the original post, I'll add direct links when the console comes back on both sites!"
1680,"You're welcome!

I've received several PMs from other redditors whenever a copy of the Limited Edition of Majora's Mask 3D was available for pre-order here in Canada. I was happily surprised to see that people are ready to help other fans of the franchise to get what they want. I take this occasion to give in return and help in anyway I can with this new console."
1797,I'd prefer that a random stranger who loves Zelda or Majora's Mask stumbles upon it and manage to get one rather than a random scalper that only care about the money he'll get out of it.
2244,"I sincerly hope you manage to get one!

Looking at how many Europe has available, I hope it is only a temporary problem and we'll eventually get more in a near future. There's almost no way to get the limited edition of the game anywhere in NA but there's tons of places in Europe that still has their Special Edition available. I try to stay positive and hope they will have more stock available just like they announced with the rare Amiibos"
5222,"Well, there isn't much to report right now...

* [Amazon.ca](http://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B00S8IGG4U/ref=olp_product_details?ie=UTF8&amp;me=) - Nothing to report here, only scalpers copies showing up ranging from 499.99$ to 999.99$

* [Ebgames](https://www.ebgames.ca/3DS/Games/719125/new-nintendo-3ds-xl-majoras-mask-edition) - Out of Stock since the announcement, they sold out pretty quickly.

* Future Shop / Best Buy - Still MIA, anytime now

* Walmart.ca - I don't think they take pre-orders but they'll probably have them available in-store at launch, I just can't take the risk to wait until then.

* Target Canada - Well, with yesterday's announcement, they probably won't be open in February so I believe that's one less to place to check. 

* [Nintendo](http://www.nintendo.com/en_CA/3ds/buynow/) - Their website still says **Pre-order coming soon** since the announcement, I bet they'll be out of stock everywhere before they update it.

Did I miss any?"
5665,"There's some chances I wouldn't rule the possibility out yet, but let's just say that I'd prefer securing a pre-order elsewhere before turning to them. "
6103,"Well, they might not update their websites very often, but at least, there's still a possibility that they'll have them, so that might help a few desperate last minute fans getting one.

Remember that on Nintendo's website it was said that Archambault would have the Limited Edition of Majora's Mask 3D and when this announcement was made, they still didn't have the standard edition available on their website at all, they added it recently, but still nothing concerning the LE. (Somehow, they still have the N64 and Collector's Edition of the N64 version on their site, which link to 404 pages, but still, made me laugh ([Link](http://www.archambault.ca/qmi/navigation/search/ExtendedSearchResults.jsp?_new_value=false&amp;searchType=ALL&amp;searchType_new_value=false&amp;erpId=ACH&amp;searchMode=simple&amp;department=&amp;searchInput=majora%27s+mask)) 

As for the Source, I don't want a Bell Mobile Phone so I guess there's no need to go there."
6311,"I don't think they will, but I still wish deep down inside of me that one day, they will do like Nintendo UK."
6583,"Unless Nintendo announces that it is not a ''rare'' one time only edition and that they will restock it for a few months before discontinuing it, I don't believe they will."
8941,"Always depends on how many they have available, BestBuy in the US had them up for sale for about 45min if I recall correctly, some places were out of stock in 15min or so.

For the Limited Edition of Majora's Mask 3D, I managed to get one from the second batch on Amazon.ca and they sold out in 6min, I barely got the time to create a thread on here before they were out."
9681,"I hope so! The only thing that worries me is that it disappeared from their sites hours ago and have not been seen again since while the standard editions yesterday appeared at midnight PST and stayed there, unavailable until 9AM PST (12pm EST) 

There might have been too many people calling in or opening tickets because they could see them but not access the page, which might explain why they hid the pages until they are actually ready for pre-order this time."
12148,"According to new posts on both /r/zelda and /r/Nintendo by /u/BovieVei and /u/portaldark, BestBuy in the US is cancelling orders from scalpers and families who ordered more than one copy of the Limited Edition new 3DS.

Best Buy Canada and Future Shop are probably going to act in a similar way so if you're a scalper, I hope you die in a fire and if you simply planned on buying more than one for your family/SO, I would watch out for any surprise."
12878,"Nope, nothing yet, I'm refreshing non-stop just in case."
14857,anytime now D:
15885,"it was posted right as I was updating my OP with the user response saying it was going to be at 2:30pm, thank you!
"
18731,"I had a problem checking out with a VISA card twice, they somehow couldn't identify my card, I tried with a MasterCard and it got through without any problem. 

That's the only issue I've had."
18754,You're welcome! 
18813,"Yeah I noticed that, the real links showed up on Best Buy and Future Shop forums before it was even available through the search system and even before the twitter confirmation, glad we had more than one way to find it!"
18964,"It takes a while for the confirmation E-mail to go through, I was so scared I had a second one in my cart ready to order just in case it failed haha!"
18988,Congratulations to you and to everyone who managed to get one!
19258,You're more than welcome!
19457,"Keep refreshing, some of them get released when people have them for too long in their cart without buying."
19496,Congrats!
21102,"So much love and appreciation! I'm so glad I did this, I feel more joy knowing that I was able to help so many people get the Limited edition than getting one myself.

I hope you will all have fun saving Termina next month on your Limited Edition console!  "
42614,"So far, Best Buy, Future Shop, Walmart and Toys R' Us don't take in-store pre-order but they will most likely have it available so I would suggest going to one of these place on the day it is released (be there early) and you might be able to get your hand on one!

Edit: There might be Target Canada too buy I wouldn't put too much hope on this one considering they are closing soon."
