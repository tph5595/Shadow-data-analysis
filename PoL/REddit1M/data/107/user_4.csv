12883,"OK, I was just curious.

I hope it works out for you"
13102,"Yeah, it's a pretty shitty situation, it's not like you ordered 10.

There's still hope for getting some at retailers at launch, like toysrus.

I just know I'd feel like crap if it happened to me. I bet they are just bitter cause they didn't get one.

Maybe make friends with one of the employees, they'll give you the inside details."
