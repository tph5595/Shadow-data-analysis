41657,"it sucks because I'm unable to preorder from work :(, and seeing people sell it it for 500 pisses me off. good on best buy stopping scalpers from doing this, however i feel bad for the people who ordered for others. fingers crossed for a second wave or availability at stores that didn't do preorders!!"
