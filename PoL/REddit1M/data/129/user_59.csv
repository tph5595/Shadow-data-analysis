18629,"Here's a few that always get me:

-The Goron Dance mini-game in OoA. Beating for the main quest isn't bad, but fuck everything about trying to get the rings for perfectly completing that game.

-The Deku Playground in MM. Day 2 is just ridiculous if you can't fly Deku Link that well. Makes every other flying challenge seem super easy, though.

-The Goht challenge in MM. WHAT DO YOU MEAN I DIDN'T HIT THE MIDDLE OF THOSE CHESTS I WAS PERFECTLY CENTERED?!

-The Salvatore game on Windfall in WW. It's based entirely on luck and gets super obnoxious if you don't beat it immediately.

For the most part I don't have too much trouble with anything in the main quest lines. The puzzle to get the Master Sword in TP and just adjusting to the motion controls in SS are some of the big exceptions for me."
