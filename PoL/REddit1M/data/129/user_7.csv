Master Quest could be beaten with patience. The Water Temple was annoying at times, but doable. Even the last boss at the end of both Oracle of Ages and Oracle of Seasons was (despite being incredibly difficult) eventually beatable.

But good god, man. I applaud any of you that have the gorillion rupees to show for beating that Boss Run. Freaking. Hard."
