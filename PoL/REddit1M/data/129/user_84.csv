21608,"collecting the tears in twilight princess was really dumb. I just hated playing as a wolf in general, but the tear collecting and killing the bugs over and over was sooo boring. Trying to find them all in the buildings in Kakariko village took FOREVER, and the 3rd time you collect the tears, when you are flying on the bird thing, was not fun for me at all. I stopped playing half way through collecting the third set of tears and havent returned since."
