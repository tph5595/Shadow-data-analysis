21149,"iirc, the only LoZ handheld game that has a key mishap is the 4th dungeon in links awakening. I haven't played through Seasons in a while, but I don't think you're stuck, it sounds to me like there might be a bombable wall you just need to find. One of those times where the dungeon map may come in handy big time. Again, don't completely quote me on that, because it has been a while. 

Reminds me that I need to get a 3DS soon so I can download the oracle games again. I miss them."
