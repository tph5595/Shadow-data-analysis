13375,"Water Temple is my favourite temple in all of Zelda. The whole temple was one large puzzle based on 3d acuity which was fantastic for the time! As an engineer I give them props! Also it still had the best mini boss of all time (Dark Link) and that fantastic final boss that was right out of ""The Abyss""!"
