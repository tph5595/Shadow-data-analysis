Most 2D dungeons were grid based, and, in my opinion, still easier to navigate than the Master Quest Dungeons. 3D dungeons added vertical elements, intersecting rooms, and rooms layered on top of each other in ways that the 2D games simply couldn't. I'm not knocking the 2D Zeldas, they are among my absolute favorites. I just think Master Quest was more difficult."
