Essentially, before you start the game, you pause buffer until the rupees on the horizontal platforms fall off. Then, you go pick those up and start the game with only needing to get the vertical platform rupees, which are much easier to grab. This is a speedrunning trick for MM 100%, but I understand if you feel that it's not beating the mini-game legitimately."
