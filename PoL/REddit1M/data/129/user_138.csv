If you had the patience to make it to the great palace, you fight a few Iron Knuckles and by then you're like ""Yeah. I can beat these guys no problem."" And then the Fokka shows up and he's just like an Iron Knuckle except a shitload faster, throws his sword and a MUCH FASTER SPEED and can JUMP. That's when the true butt clenching began for me. That's when I knew that I was really in for it with the final Palace of the hardest Zelda game. "
