Skyward Sword had the most challenging (and in my opinion fun) combat. Before anyone pipes up with it, it isn't 'challenging' because of the controls being dodgy. They weren't. I never found them to be annoying and got pretty good at using them. They made the combat actually require a bit of thought and skill, far more than any other Zelda game. The bosses actually felt like a fight, as opposed to the Twilight Princess bosses which, while looking very big and epic, were pathetically easy."
