11765,Flipping my DS closed and open again in Phantom Hourglass. Because I'm an idiot.

It was - for those reasons - that this puzzle has always stuck with me when I think of innovation in puzzles. It's not hard, or even that outlandish of a puzzle by any means. There's just also nothing inherent about the action - no previous instance I'd ever had to do something like this to continue playing. 

It was one of the first times in a LONG time that I was given a puzzle I had absolutely no inkling how to solve in any way. And that's why it's always my hardest puzzle. It's the only one I've had to break the fourth wall to figure out."
