18291,"I thought the cave of ordeals in this game was much harder, and the most difficult part of any Zelda game I have ever encountered. "
19095,Down to the last floor? 
21384,"I just meant the floors go down. And it took me 4 tries and the magic armor to beat it. 

First time: ""I have a blue potion, this shouldn't be too bad... Whoa wtf just happened here."" 
Second time: ""Ok that was tough, this time I'll grab a couple fairies and a blue potion again.... Where is the bottom level of this thing? And I'm dead."" 
Third time: bring same set up just be careful with health and I'll be fine. Get to bottom couple levels you're referring to, fuck, fuck, fuck what is going on in these caves!! And dead again. 
Fourth time: All blue potions! Full wallet! Super careful not to lose unessessary health. Search every floor carefully with the wolf to get any buried health. 

Of course by this time I'm used to the early floors and use one potion and no magic Armour. I'd say it would have been worth if I had done it early in the game but I did it just before the Ganon fight so I didn't get to use the rewards much. "
