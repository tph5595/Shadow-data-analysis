24335,"From a programmer perspective, I believe that the game is waiting for a state of suspension to trigger the ""solving action"" of the puzzle. That would be something along the lines of ""OnSuspend"" or something like that, so, considering that the 2ds has a slider switch that puts the 2ds in the same state that is triggered by closing a ds or 3ds, I suppose it should work just fine. But of course, the mechanic of the puzzle is completely lost and actually becomes harder to figure out for someone who has never played the game before...


EDIT: I don't know how to explain myself. I hope you understand."
