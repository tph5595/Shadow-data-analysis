16435,"After playing Spirit Tracks first and now starting PH, i say fuck PH and those phantom dungeon crap. I hope I never have to play those types of dungeons ever again in any other zelda after I beat PH."
16517,I thought that was rather easy only after playing it the second time. First time it was confusing. 
19050,"I loved it while playing it, but I think that was because I hadn't played a Zelda game in like 5 years. After playing ALLTP afterwards twice, it's not even fair to compare to any quality Zelda I guess. 

As a Zelda game? Eh. A lot of the dialog is for tweens it felt like. 

Main quest is okay, still a bunch more of the phantom nonsense but with an added curve of controlling Zelda as well.

Side quests are kinda lame, because you have to do all of them to unlock the only two sword skills.(I will say I did enjoy catching rabbits before I knew I had to to conquer the game)

Overall it was very sub par. Riding in the train is really fun at first, then becomes a giant hassle(which I never felt in WW for a reference). 

At the end, I just wanted the game to be over. 

Lost woods is a cool reference, dark link is cool but completely extra, and the bosses were cool. Other than that the game was very average."
29757,Good luck. I played TP already but am playing again. Haven't played SS but that's my next one.
