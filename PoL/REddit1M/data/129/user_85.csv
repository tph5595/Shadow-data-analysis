21924,"Disregarding the fake difficulty I can think of, the stealth mission in the Gerudo Fortress in OoT was incredibly fun AND quite challenging, to my memory. I was ten when I was playing it, but still. I really liked sneaking around the guards like some kind of Solid Link, and when it got to actually fighting the Gerudo ladies I had incredible fun that I think was due to the fact that I'd had to stay away from them for so long. It's like staring at a cupcake in a glass box for twelve hours before you can eat it, the resulting cupcake is so much sweeter than it would be if you'd eaten it straight off.

[Before I say this, if you liked Skyward Sword, you may not want to read this next sentence because it will make you rage. The ACTUAL most difficult thing in a Zelda game I've had to do is sit for ANY length of time with that game. I hate it with all my soul.]"
