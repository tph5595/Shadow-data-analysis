15016,"The sixth dungeon in oracle of seasons (the one in the ancient tomb thing) im not entirely sure but ive looked everywhere in that temple and i believe there is a ""fake"" key hole where you can waste you key and then you can't finish the dungeon because you dont have enough keys to unlock the important doors. Bu fake i mean its just useless, and for which one its one of those golden squares with the key hole facing up and it leads to another room. Its a short cut but it screws up the dungeon."
