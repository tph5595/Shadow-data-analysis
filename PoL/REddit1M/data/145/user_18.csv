23048,"Possible character: bring back young link, but MM version. Down and B for transform (like pokemon trainer and Zelda). Changes between normal, deku, goron and zora Link.

Nerdgasm.

Edit: supersmash = fierce deity.

More Edits: I got to excited and created all the moves.

Link:

* B - Bomb (Because he cant lose this.)
* Forward B - Bow and arrow. (possibly chargeable)
* Up B - Spin attack bitches!

Deku Link:

* B - Bubble attack Mother fuckers! (Chargeable)
* Forward B - Spin attack with twirly hat
* Up and B - Quickly enter flower and is blown out. Two flowers appear in hands to help him float.

Goron Link:

* B - Super punch (Bring it on Falcon)
* Forward B - Rock roll (Charge to produce spikes. Not brought to you by Rick Astley)
* Up B - Ball bounce (Like King Deedee's one but with less ass and more balls.)

Zora Link:

* B - Fire the blades on his arms. (chargeable, can still move and hopefully always catch it mid-back flip.)
* Forward B - Fin blade combo. Have to hit it three times to get perfect combo.
* Up B - A charged attack like Fox's Falcos etc but with the blue spiral shit.

I would also like to see each instrument incorporated somehow too."

48249,Good idea. Now how do I let Nintendo know?
48278,"Hahaha, he would have to be OP for sure."
