39659,"Fun fact: Fire Emblem was only ever translated and brought to America because of Marth and Roy's likability in Smash Bros.
I wouldn't say Meta Knight or Dedede whatsoever, what with Epic Yarn, Squeak Squad, and the new 3DS Kirby title, but yes, the Ice Climbers are DEFINITELY an old relic for the newer generation."

The opportunity to have it re-released in HD with new content makes me IMMENSELY happy, and I think it would truly add to an already (in my opinion) perfect game. Where am I meant to carry out speculation or discussion about my hopes/wants for a new game if not /r/zelda? As /r/Petertwnsnd said, it's entirely reasonable to expect that they'd remake MM at this point in time, both based on their release patterns and official quotes from developers. Just because you don't care about a certain game being redeveloped doesn't mean that nobody else does, in fact, it makes you the minority here."
