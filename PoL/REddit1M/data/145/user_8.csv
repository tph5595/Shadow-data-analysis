16477,"Hmm. This screenshot is exclusive to the WiiU version (see the website, it has the WiiU banner on te top left side). 

So maybe this does hint at a MM HD remake instead of a 3DS remake! "
39839,"I think after the succes of Wind Waker HD it's pretty likely and Majora's Mask has been hinted at in A Link Between Worlds as well. So I think that maybe it might be revealed at VGX this saturday (Seems more likely then the ""Next-Gen"" Zelda game which is rumored)"
