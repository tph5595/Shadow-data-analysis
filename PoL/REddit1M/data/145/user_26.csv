27449,"Pit was added to Brawl before the new Kid Icarus game came out.

Marth/Roy were added it Melee when Fire Emblem was about to come to the states.

Ike was added to Brawl when his most recent Fire Emblem game had been out for a few months.

Mewtwo was added to Melee weeks before his new movie came out.

Lucario added to Brawl while the 4th generation of Pokemon was still popular.

Toon Link replaced Young Link in between Phantom Hourglass and Spirit tracks, which both feature him.

Brawl added Wario with his Smooth Moves costume after Smooth Moves came out and shortly before ""Shake It!""

Little Mac was an **assist trophy in Brawl** who had a new game that came out a year later.


Obviously there is a trend here and I didn't even list them all. Smash Bros is an advertising machine. Kids play this game and learn the characters, and when they see those characters in other games, they buy those games. The reverse is also true, so when they play the games/see the movies with those characters and see them again in Smash Bros, they will buy Smash Bros. To deny even the possibility of something like that happening again is illogical."
31293,"&gt; I just find it a little bit of a leap to assume that the inclusion of a popular Zelda character in a Nintendo mashup game implies directly a remake of a game involving him.

That's the thing though. The title of this post is ""...***Possible*** Foreshadowing?"" No where did anyone imply a direct link to a remake.  They only brought up the possibility, to which you replied: ""No.""

So don't say 
&gt;I am not denying the possibility of a remake of MM.

 after you just did.

I know correlation does not prove causation, but Nintendo obviously has both rhyme and reason for a lot of the characters they put in their games, and to deny the possibility like you originally stated, is illogical."
