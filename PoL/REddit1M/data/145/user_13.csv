21721,"Even if it isn't the logical conclusion to jump to, Nintendo really has been paying attention to the fans asking for a MM remake, or at least of their love for it. 

Majora's Mask connection in LBW?
Majora's Mask remastered soundtrack as a platinum reward?
Skull Kid as an assist trophy in an upcoming game?

At least they are listening to the fanbase. It doesn't confirm anything, but it only makes the possibility seem more likely. "

R.O.B. would be harder; it was much cooler at it's time than people would expect. 

And, Game and Watch rewards for Club Nintendo exist, even a remake of ""Ball"". Not exactly a comeback but they are noticed. 

Point being, they haven't really been forgotten, the calling for bringing them back wasn't as big. They did make a new Kid Icarus game (Which I highly recommend), and a lot of people didn't even know who he was she he was announced as a playable character. 

Nothing is set in stone. It could just be to make the long time fans happy, and that's fine, too. But if Nintendo sees it as a profitable investment of time and resources I think there is a chance. This doesn't confirm anything, of course.... Just sort of affirms they know the fans still have a strong love of the game. That's just my opinion of it, though. "
