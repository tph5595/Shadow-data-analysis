28042,"A new transforming mask would mean a new storyline, a new dungeon...the whole game would need a new balance and changes everywhere. I'm not sure if Nintendo would actually do something like that, seeing that Wind Waker didn't get changed a bit (come on, a fast sail is not THAT much of a change) and Ocarina of Time neither. 

I just want a normal remake of the game with nice graphics. Majoras Mask is, like it is, perfect."
