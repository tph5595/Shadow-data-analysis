101620,"Would you mind explaining to me why everyone likes toon Link? I have been a fan of Zelda since I was a kid, but when Windwaker came out I didn't play it because the toon link looks more than slightly retarded. After Majora's Mask I have only played Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword. 
I don't understand why people like the toon Link games. I guess I just can't get past the shitty appearance.  What am I missing? Did the story make up for the childish graphics? "
