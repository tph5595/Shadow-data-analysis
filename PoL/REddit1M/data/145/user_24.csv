26063,"I swear, this subreddit should just be renamed to ""/r/MajorasMask"". Yes, I get it, people think it's a great game. But come on. If we keep just looking at the past and let nostalgia get in the way, we won't be able to move on to bigger and better things. I honestly never owned an N64 as a kid. I chose a PSOne over it because my neighbor had an N64 with OoT, and I honestly didn't care for the feel and look of it. I did, however, have an SNES and my all-time favorite, the GBA. The game that got me into loving the Legend of Zelda franchise was Minish Cap, followed by me begging my parents to buy me a Gamecube so I could buy Wind Waker. Now, do I just sit around in my room crying that they aren't releasing Minish Cap onto every single system they make? Heck no! That's a very silly idea and is downright selfish to expect a game company to cater to those who regard nostalgic things as the pinnacle of gaming excellence. If it weren't for the fact that you were young, your mind was filled with imagination, and that video games were still relatively fresh and getting their sea legs, you probably wouldn't hold that game in such high regards as you do. Please for the love of god, can we just all stop crying over not getting a rerelease on MM every single time Nintendo releases a console? This may sound really just childish to get a little ticked over silly video games that are made solely for entertainment purposes, but criminy-jeekers, guys. Stop living in the past and enjoy exploring new directions, just like your younger self once did."
