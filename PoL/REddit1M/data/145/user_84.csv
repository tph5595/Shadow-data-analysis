57681,"Seriously, I don't understand why so many people want a Majora's Mask remake. Yes, it's an amazing game, yes it's nice to see it get acknowledged by the creators, but it's still just the same game.

Now, a Majora's Mask sequel? *That,* I could get behind. Show us Termina years later, delve into the history and mythology behind Termina and Majora's Mask, reintroduce Skull Kid after he's stopped being a dick, expand on the gameplay the original game presented. Go absolutely all-out on it in a massive love letter to Majora's Mask. Do that and I'll gladly scream in joy with all the other fans."
