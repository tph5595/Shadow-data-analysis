35713,Why do we need a Majora's Mask 3D?  Just make it a sequel or something set in that timeline involving Termina.  We've had enough remakes lately and look how cool Link Between Worlds was.  I hated Link to the Past but going back to a world that was semi familiar but a completely new story and dungeons was amazing.  The additions in the remakes are just not enough I think unless they want to add bonus dungeons or more masks to Majora.
39457,"My first Zelda game was Link's Awakening when it first came out on Gameboy Pocket, so I just missed the Link to the Past game, and I never ended up playing it until the remake came out on GBA.  I think compared to all of the Zelda games after that, with the Oracle games being my favorite gameplay Zelda and Majora's Mask my favorite story based, I was just not as enthralled by it as I should have been.  It always kind of had a Zelda 2 feel to me - not that it was an RPG but that it was experimenting and trying to change up the series.  I understand at the time it was and it was a precursor to making Zelda how it was, but I just do not like how it feels.  It was a little too open for my liking, I hated the magic system (which I've never really liked in any Zelda game, but it was pretty important in this one), the dungeons were either super straight forward or just left you to your own devices, and the entire time I wanted to play it to finish it, rather than beat it.  Maybe if I had played it before OoT, Majora's Mask, the Oracle games, Link's Awakening, and Wind Waker, I would have enjoyed it more.  But since I played some of the best games in the series first and then went back to it, it just felt like a cheap imitation to me.  I always get a lot of hate when I say I did not like Link to the Past, but I usually don't explain myself as thoroughly as this."
