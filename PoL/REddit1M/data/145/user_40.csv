32827,"Wasn't Toon Link technically an adult Link since he was the same age as the ""Hero of Time,"" whom Hyrule had only known Adult Link to be?"
33021,"I actually legitimately think it is a hint at MM3D. Why? Because usually in SSB Nintendo only includes stuff from the most recent Marios, Zeldas, etc. Like in SSBB, they only included Zelda stuff from WW and TP. So they should really only be including stuff from SS and maybe OoT3D in SSBU, but for some reason they decided to put in the most symbolic character from MM."
38480,Is that canon?
41025,"But that doesn't make any sense. The Hero of Time was never the age of 14.

Btw you're right about Young Link=10 and Adult Link=17, I vividly recall that from the official guide. Damn I wish i still had that guide, I love how it guided you through the game as if it were telling a story."
43593,Oh well that makes every WAY less confusing
48571,"Yeah, but a remake I would argue might allow that rule to be broken, since everything except the graphics update is finalized already."
