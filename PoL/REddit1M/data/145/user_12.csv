It's my dream that the remake will have more content than the OoT remake; Every Zelda game has it's own sort of 'catch.' With Majora's Mask it's time, Similar to the movie ""Groundhogs Day."" And lets not forget the ability to change into other races such as Deku, Goron and Zora.  
Additional side quests, areas and masks could be inserted to add new feels to the already IMO moodiest/bestest Zelda title ever made.


More transforming masks, weapons and items? (WW remake Got a new sail!)

It would be awesome if they attempted to make it even darker visually (or emotionally via additional quests). It would be a healthy change of pace for Nintendo to make something a little gritty. There has been a surplus of fruity (which I must admit I love, too) first party titles, and Nintendo hasn't been afraid to go a little dark (twilight princess or metriod prime series). After all, Majora's Mask has been around for a long while and gained a huge reputation. Nintendo could push it in the direction it's already known for to further set it apart from the others in the series.

Make the best game you can, Nintendo.
