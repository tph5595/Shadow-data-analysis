39421,why not just have fierce deity link as a character?
39801,"idky the fuck they wouldn't do it for the 3ds at this point. They redid OoT so a lot of that work is already done. Fuck them damn it. I mean we beg for years for a MM remake and they say ""nah fuck you"" then they remake WW. I mean I love WW and all but I hadn't heard of a single movement demanding a WW remake. Whereas the outcry for MM is very large and very loud."
40214,each instrument is easy. They'd just have to map those to one of the taunt buttons. They already have toon link's wind waker and I think one of links forms plays the ocarina with one of his taunts.
