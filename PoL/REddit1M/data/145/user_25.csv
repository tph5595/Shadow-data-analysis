26280,Who isn't Young Link in any way whatsoever.
26378,Oh gods you are going to get pummeled into oblivion by this subreddit but you are 100% correct.
34450,"I believe Young Link in OoT is 10, Adult is 17, and Toon is 14 at the time of Wind Waker...  I recall that being *somewhere* in the depths of Zelda lore, maybe on their Super Smash Bros. trophies."
38658,Assuming it's never been explicitly stated anywhere else and Smash Bros. is a Nintendo production I would certainly consider any information on the trophies canon.
41962,"I am pretty confident the Hero of Winds wasn't 10, anyway.  It's not unfeasible that the actual age of the Hero of Time got lost to history especially since he disappeared in that timeline."
43085,"wat.

Source?"
49609,"So all the semi-official sources say he's 12, but the ""legend"" says he's 9.

I'm inclined to believe the semi-official sources, then.  It's extremely likely that the legend of the Hero of Time was twisted over the centuries between OoT and Wind Waker."
60298,"And did Iwata ever say that the people of the Great Sea did not twist the legend to a false age at some point?

They didn't even remember that Hyrule, their original home, was buried underwater.  Are we expected to trust them 100% that they knew the exact age Link was before he picked up the Master Sword (which would be a minimal part of the legend also because he saved the day as an adult).

Personally I'll go with the Nintendo-sanctioned trophies and strategy guides that say the Hero of Winds is 12.  Instead of people who are hundreds of generations separated from the Hero of Time."
