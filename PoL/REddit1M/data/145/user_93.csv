NOT ONLY IS THE FUELING PURELY NOSTALGIC BASED, BUT THE ONLY PLACE I HEAR ALL THIS ""LE MAJORA'S MASK 3D SO MUCH BETTER THAN OOT"" CRAP IS HERE! There's a reason that games like Ocarina of Time, Wind Waker, and A Link To The Past get re-makes and sequels. And that reason is most definitely not a corner of the internet circlejerking over how underrated it is and putting down other games in the franchise to compensate for the fact that the game really wasn't underrated, it just wasn't very good.
