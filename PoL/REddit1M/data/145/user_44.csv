That was a large rant and so I'm going address each point one at a time.

&gt; If we keep just looking at the past and let nostalgia get in the way, we won't be able to move on to bigger and better things.

You do realize how ridiculous that argument is, especially for this series, correct? The last 3 Zelda games released were A Link Between World (a sequel to a game that came out over two decades ago), Wind Waker HD (a remake of a Gamecube game), and Ocarina of Time 3D (a remake of a came that came out over a decade before). For the fans to talk about what re-releases or remake the series might make next is perfectly understandable, especially since that's the trend the series seems to be taking right now.

&gt; I honestly never owned an N64 as a kid. I chose a PSOne over it because my neighbor had an N64 with OoT, and I honestly didn't care for the feel and look of it. I did, however, have an SNES and my all-time favorite, the GBA. The game that got me into loving the Legend of Zelda franchise was Minish Cap, followed by me begging my parents to buy me a Gamecube so I could buy Wind Waker.

At this point I'm not sure if you ever actually owned or even played Majora's Mask or if you just messed around with OoT at a friend's house a few times when you where younger in which case ""Don't knock it if you haven't tried it"". Personally, when I was younger I tried OoT and didn't like it very much, but when I tried it out when I was older I fell in love with it. I would suggest disregarding all the hype around OoT and MM and try playing them now with an open mind.

&gt; Now, do I just sit around in my room crying that they aren't releasing Minish Cap onto every single system they make?

If by every single system you mean 3DS remake like OoT (which sounds reasonable) or an HD remake for WiiU like Wind Waker (which also sounds reasonable).

&gt; That's a very silly idea and is downright selfish to expect a game company to cater to those who regard nostalgic things as the pinnacle of gaming excellence. 

It might be, if they hadn't already done just that with Ocarina of Time 3D

&gt;If it weren't for the fact that you were young, your mind was filled with imagination, and that video games were still relatively fresh and getting their sea legs, you probably wouldn't hold that game in such high regards as you do.

I don't think that's true at all. Like I mentioned earlier, I didn't play OoT or MM till I was in high school so there is no real nostalgia value for me and I had been playing games for years before and I still loved the game and I'm not the only one. Professional video game critics give near perfect scores and it received not only the Award of Action game of the Year from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences, but was also declared Game of the Decade for 2000-2009 by GameFAQs. To claim that people only liked it because they were young when they played it is just not true.

That's about it. Those where the main point in your argument or ""rant"". I hope you change you opinion of the games and that in the future you give use a more logical argument instead of what basically boiled down to just whining that the most of the fans like it,but you don't so it's dumb."
