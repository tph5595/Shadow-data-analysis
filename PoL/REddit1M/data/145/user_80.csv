48509,There's already enough Links as it is.
48640,They released the new Smash Link and it is not SS or WW Link. I've heard people say it's probably the next Link for the Wii U Zelda.
48699,"It isn't, though. It doesn't have the same art style, as all the other Links in the Smash games had in common with the Links they were based on."
48910,The number of assist trophies and characters in smash games that did not have new releases vastly outnumbers the number of assist trophies and characters that did have new releases.
55066,"I didn't say nor did I imply that it was SS Link. I believe it was miyamoto or aounuma that said the new art style is going to be q cross between the cartoony style of SS and a more serious, dark style. I think this is probably the Link for the upcoming game. Also, I know brawl link is TP Link, that's obvious, but I really doubt the new game has a Link that isn't very relevant to where the series is currently."
59701,I'm not sure what you're saying. To fits? Zelda was supposed to be a villager and Demise was the first incarnation of Ganon. 
64247,"Like I said, I don't think it will be the SS Link, Zelda, or Ganondorf. It will likely be the new Link in the new game that will be announced soon that Miyamoto has described the art style of, and the new smash Link looks like what he described in the art style and design."
