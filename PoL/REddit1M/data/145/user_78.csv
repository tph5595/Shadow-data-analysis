Look at these pictures. The only thing ""Skyward Sword"" about the new Smash Link is that his chainmail is silver. 

He has the TP buckles, bracer/boot design, the hair, left handed, everything about him is TP

Edit, Even the notch of stitching at the end of his hat is twilight princess. Theres no way this is coincidence. Look at the bombs from the other screenshots, hes holding a twilight princess bomb, not a bomb flower. If its the new ""hd link"" hes based on TP's design so much its not funny.

I challenge anyone to find any sort of opposing evidence that this is SS Link and not TP Link"

Sorry I'm on mobile. Anyways. Ss doesn't fit in smash because the character theme doesn't align. Ganondorf and Zelda are almost certain to appear and their designs in skyward don't work for smash. "
