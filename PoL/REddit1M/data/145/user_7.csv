15621,No. Why is that the logical conclusion?
29046,"Correlation does not imply causation though.   I am not denying the possibility of a remake of MM. The problem is that they have also thrown in a bunch of new characters into each game without a corresponding addition to their franchise. They did that as more of an homage to Nintendo history or a popular character. Skull Kid with Majora's Mask is widely regarded as one of the more enigmatic and ""cool"" villains of Zelda, so it is a surprise it took this long for him to show up, as there was a profound lack of Zelda related items and assist trophies, though this is largely compensated by the number of playable characters from Zelda.

I want to believe that a remake of MM is in the works, and I do believe that it is true. I just find it a little bit of a leap to assume that the inclusion of a popular Zelda character in a Nintendo mashup game implies directly a remake of a game involving him."
