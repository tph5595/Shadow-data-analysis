He's probably not a stage character since the stage that they're on is Skyloft, and Skyward Sword has virtually nothing to do with Majora's Mask.

Assist Trophy is the only thing that makes sense unless the Skyloft stage just throws all sorts of random Zelda references out over time, or the game is introducing something new other than Assist Trophies and Skull Kid is one of those.

However, if you're saying that the wild arbitrary logical leap is that Skull Kid's appearance is foreshadowing MM 3D/HD, that's fair enough."
