34757,"Hoenn is basically confirmed already. Director said 3rd gen was his favorite to work on. They're probably going to revamp it with 6th gen engine and that's why it's taking a while.



Don't quote me on this though, just what I recall.


MMHD/3D though, I want so bad because I was never able to play MM before :/ "
36755,"Yup! I really can't wait. Hoenn with Gen 6 engine is going to look incredible. 

Z might come out right after, I can't remember. Did platinum come out before or after hg/ss? "
36849,"It isn't Hoenn he is referring to. He later says ""I'll give you a hint! It's not Kanto, Jhoto, Hoenn, Sinnoh, Unova, or Kalos!"" 

We are guessing it is something similar to the islands in Fire red or the battle area like d/p/p"
37188,I remember someone posting a pattern on how they released games. Might be Z next before R/S/E remakes
42384,"I really want it on gc but I can't find it anywhere 

Expensive as balls"
42412,"Either way 

Game freak is gonna have my money in their pockets 

So :("
42485,"Yup, from my knowledge this is true. It would make sense though, all newer pokemon on handheld will need to be on per with x and Y engine. Gonna be beautiful "
56332,"I'm not sad, it's just that X&amp;Y right now has infinite playtime for me right now. Adding in Z or S/R/E remakes is going to make me sad.

WHICH ONE DO I PLAY"
