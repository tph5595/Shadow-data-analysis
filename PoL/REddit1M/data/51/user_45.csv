22189,there is the chance that its slow in those cases because of the emulator/game and not your PC
2038799,"pardon the necro-post, but someone should explain why you are mistaken here, computer performance can be bottle-necked in 2 general areas, hardware and/or software, its possible if not easy to write software so bad that not even the the best super computer can run it as fast as good software on a phone to do the same job

in the case of the hyrule field slowdown and emulators in general, emulators are bottle-necked in many cases by the emulator software not being perfect relative to the the Wii/GC software on its own hardware"
2045491,"the point is that its the software thats bottle-necking and not the hardware and buying better hardware would not fix the issue

[notice how on the wiki page the slow down is listed as an issue with the emulator that is now fixed](https://wiki.dolphin-emu.org/index.php?title=The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess_%28GC%29#Hyrule_Field_Slow_Down)"
