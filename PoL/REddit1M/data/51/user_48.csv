24830,"What about mine? I tried to do it a month or so ago, but whenever I got to hyrule or even just left the first area and into the cave, I lagged liked hell:

- 8 GB RAM

- Intel i5 Core 2.40 GHz

- 64bit

Some games that somewhat work if I used the special setting configuration I searched forever online to make things work are NHL HItz 20-02 and Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes."
