9237,"I tried looking for a solution for this two, but so far I haven't been able to find anything perfect... What I had to do is go into properties&gt;patches and enable Fix Item Hang, this stops cutscenes from freezing, but it also disabled almost all other sounds, and I have no idea how to turn them back on.

If anyone has a better fix, PLEASE share with us!"
