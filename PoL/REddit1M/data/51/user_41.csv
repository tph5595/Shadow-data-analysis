20759,"Do you know if this helps out for Xenoblade Chronicles as well?  I've experienced incredibly huge slowdown when trying to play it. 

Also, if i have the stable 4.0.2 version, and i download the current build, do i need to uninstall first?"
22780,Servs me right for not reading a changelog first eh?  In any case thank you for the update.  Now about part 2. Do you know if i can just overwrite the files in the install directory? or do i need to completely uninstall first?
25568,Awesome thanks.  I'd imagine it wiped them due to overwriting the DLL files but i'm not certain.
