7391,Are those widescreen images?  I thought TP for GameCube was 4:3 only.
7955,"Can I convince you expand on that? I've been hoping to find time to do another play through of TP (haven't done it since it released), but until now assumed I'd prefer playing the wii version again for widescreen.

I'd love to know more about doing it this way."
