10360,Hrm. Wonder how much of a difference this will make on my 2010 Macbook Pro.
199344,"AWESOME news. I upgraded to 8GB of RAM and an SSD a few months ago, and I've got one of those Trio Link Plus II's for hooking my Gamecube controller up. Can't wait to give it a try."
200072,"No problem! I got [this one - the 240GB variant](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00BQ8RM1A/). Any smaller and it would've been too much work to keep junk off of it in the long run, and I didn't want to pay more than that at the time, or I would've gone bigger. The 240 was the right price for me at the time.

I also got [this hard drive caddy that goes into the optical bay](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058AH2US) so I could move my stock hard drive to where my DVD drive was.

Then I symlinked some of the larger folders in my User folder to folders on that second drive. [This article from Matt Gemmell](http://mattgemmell.com/using-os-x-with-an-ssd-plus-hdd-setup/) helped me figure that part out.

Then for good measure I put it on a [Rain Design mStand](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000OOYECC) and got a detached keyboard, mouse, and a powered USB hub to make it easy to disconnect it and run out the door."

And don't forget the hex screwdriver thingy. I did and was able to get the screws out with a small-enough flathead screwdriver, but it was kind of a pain to do."
201510,Good luck with the swap! Don't forget to make an image of the drive with SuperDuper! before you do it!
208444,Did you change any particular settings in Dolphin when you played?
