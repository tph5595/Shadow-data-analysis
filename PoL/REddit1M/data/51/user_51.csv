32174,Why are you using Dolphin for an N64 game? You would probably be better off using Project64 than trying to run a GC port on Dolphin.
57787,"It seems Project64 is Windows-only, so your friend was definitely on the right track suggesting Dolphin.

I haven't tried it personally, but this seems to be a nice cross-platform N64 emulator (Windows, OSX, Linux, and even Android): http://code.google.com/p/mupen64plus/
