0,And Twilight Princess is completely playable! Earlier Hyrule Field slowdown made the game annoyingly hard to play but that's fixed now; so if like me you sold off your Wii/GC and want to replay that awesome entry in the series (I think it's awesome anyway) the barrier to entry is lower than ever! Also does anyone know if they'll be remaking it in HD? I think that would be the only way to get me to buy a WiiU...
4928,What kind of rig do you have? The dolphin package is less than 20MB so it probably wouldn't hurt to try and see if the game runs at a native resolution at least. 
5108,"I think back then the game was hard coded to be tied to the framerate. Since every single aspect from visuals to audio is frame dependent you would literally have to rewrite the whole thing to gain fps independence. Might as well remake the game while you're at it. But yeah, that's why I don't even think about high framerates in these emulated games because unless they were coded for it it's like trying to push a cube into a circular hole."
7651,You should use a dedicated hack (AR code) which makes 16:9 without any side effects
8141,"Yeah the fixes came in a few months ago (but have been polished since then, with at least one other iteration of the ZTE speed hack) but I only caught up to them now via a post on pcmasterrace; thought I'd share with you guys who might not frequent that subreddit or have simply forgotten about the emulator (like I have). The most recent improvements to Dolphin span across the whole library, TP is but one of many fixes to performance."
8550,"Scroll down to the Widescreen hack section, it lists all the relevant codes. The way you use them is by right clicking your game in the Dolphin library, going into preferences and under AR codes clicking add and then checking the checkbox before the game is booted (the checkbox will stick after that).

9098,For PCSX2 I would set the emotion engine clock stealing and speed higher than native for intensive games that refused to run steadily. You forfeit a little bit in terms of smoothness but the end result is very playable (much more so than before the settings adjustment)
9295,"No Midna no buy [Midna is love, Midna is life](/spoiler)"
108487,"Jumping to conclusions are we? Apart from TP I enjoyed MM almost as equally so to spell it out to you- I prefer the darker Zelda games. That isn't to say I find the other zelda games inferior to those two (granted though I haven't completed any of those) it's just the tone that isn't my forte. And what do you expect from someone who's favorite games are dark souls, demon's souls, TP, MM, MGS, Castlevania.... you get the picture."
124492,"First bit you're completely wrong- where the hell did I say I'm not going to play a game without midna? Point that out; really please do. While you're at it notice that I was replying to a comment about zelda 2015.... the one that isn't out yet on a system that I don't own.

Second compare TP to wind waker. Also aren't you nitpicky, you must be fun at parties. How about this, TP is dark**er**... happy now? Quit arguing about semantics you miserable sod."
126691,"Wow, you missed it completely... ""literally any other Zelda game then"" that's what you said. My reply was only to zelda 2015.... get your shit straight"
187020,"Sure, I mean it's completely logical to buy a whole game, and a whole system for a single game that doesn't even have the elements I'm fond of. Logic overload right there."
193906,"You're right I'm being hostile but only to Kafke. I wrote ""No Midna no buy"" as a joke, sure I like her character and it would probably make me reconsider buying the new system but in essence it was a joke. Now Kafke comes along and accuses me of dissing the rest of the series based only on my joke reply to someone suggesting Zelda 2015. In all honesty the title looks stunning, but I can't afford a new system so I won't be getting it (same goes for Hyrule Warriors). I'm only being hostile to the jackass who puts words in my mouth and accuses me of things that are untrue. Now I know I'm not a hardcore fan of the Zelda series (I mean I only ever completed two installments in the series) that's why I said I prefer the ""darker"" ones. That's not to say I wouldn't play the others it's just that with a full time job and plenty of responsibilities I simply cannot commit to that. Hence why I only went for the titles that I identified with the most. I honestly have no intent of being an asshole on the internet, but when someone flings crap at me I will rebuttal."
445513,"Noted, unfortunately I haven't been a redditor for quite enough to have picked up on such facts. It sure explains why I wasn't getting through to the guy though. Good thing I just gave up on that after only a few posts, and not like after a couple dozen heh."
