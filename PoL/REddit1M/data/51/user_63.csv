Because it doesn't. 

Those screenshots that /u/IaiLwM posted loook fantastic and would be impossible to achieve using, at the very least, component cables on a CRT. "

Just because Zelda 2015 won't have Midna (or look ""dark""), doesn't mean it will be a bad game. I'm confident that it will be one of the best TLoZ games in recent times.

I bought a Wii U just for Wind Waker HD without knowing how good the remake would be. I also blindly bought a new 3DS just for ALBW without knowing if it will be good or not.

If you really want Midna on the Wii U, get Hyrule Warriors then. You can play as her."

Only upgrade I did was a RAM upgrade from 4GB to 8GB a few weeks prior."
194235,"I understand, man. Don't sweat it. I'm sure /u/Kafke wasn't trying to insult you or whatever.

I consider myself a huge fan of the series but that being said, I haven't played all of them. I've avoided the 2D Zeldas because I grew up playing the 3D ones and I don't want a drastically different experience but one day I just bucked down and played through A Link to the Past and I fell in love. Followed by Link's Awakening, Minish Cap, and Four Swords Adventure and now I love them all! 

The point is, at one point I'm sure you'll get a Wii U and will get to play Zelda 2015 along with every other Zelda game out there. Play at your own pace! If you wanna enjoy the titles that appeal to you, then go for it. Play the others later. The games won't change!

I just thought you were gonna completely avoid every other Zelda game just because Midna wasn't gonna appear, which shouldn't ever be the case!"

200813,"Perfect help man! Thank you!
Gonna probably do this swap next week!

Good luck with the emulation and everything!"
268645,"The aspect ratio does make everything look stretched but that's only because it's /u/IaiLwM preference. [As he stated in previous comment](http://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/2hzqd0/so_dolphin_got_a_huge_performance_boost/ckxk57y), Dolphin can force 16:9..aka you can simply disable the 16:9 ratio if you want to.

Regardless of the 16:9, you can see that TP recieves a signficant graphical upgrade when playing at 1080p compared to the standard 480i/p you'd get playing on a CRT. 

Also I don't own any Android devices so I wouldn't know how emulation works on them.

290673,"Okay? What about the scanlines? They're not that big of a deal considering you can play GC/Wii games on an HDTV without scanlines while using component cables

If you really want that effect, then you can get shaders for Dolphin that emulate scanlines."
