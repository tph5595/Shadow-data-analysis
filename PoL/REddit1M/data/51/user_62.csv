97111,"The slowdown could have also been 'fixed' by simply buying a better machine. Just saying.

&gt;Also does anyone know if they'll be remaking it in HD? I think that would be the only way to get me to buy a WiiU...

Probably not. Also, what about Zelda U?"
97160,Nope. You *do* need the ISOs of the games you want to play. But you can do it all digitally. I have my games loaded onto an external drive that I then use with my Wii/Laptop.
97224,IMO that looks like more than enough.
97276,Note that PS2 emulation sucks right now (and has always sucked). Dolphin is super optimized. I'd be surprised if it lagged for you.
97341,"Guess you aren't gonna play literally any other Zelda game then. Why bother coming on here?

Midna is as gone as Tatl/Navi/any other partner."
100902,"IIRC, Xenoblade is one of those games that takes every last drop of the console."
123893,"&gt;Jumping to conclusions are we? 

You said you aren't going to play any Zelda game without Midna. That's pretty much all of them.

&gt;so to spell it out to you- I prefer the darker Zelda games. That isn't to say I find the other zelda games inferior to those two (granted though I haven't completed any of those) it's just the tone that isn't my forte.

I'd disagree with the ""TP is dark"" statement. At least, not in the same breath as MM. Two different things. One is artistically dark, the other is thematically dark. If you are going for theme, you might want to include LA as well."
125261,"&gt;where the hell did I say I'm not going to play a game without midna?

My apologize, you specifically said:

&gt; No Midna no buy

The common interpretation of that is that you literally aren't going to buy a game (no buy), if it doesn't have Midna (no midna). In response to not getting a Wii U for Zelda 2015.

That to me sounds like you aren't going to buy a wii u or Zelda '15 if it doesn't have Midna.

Or rather, you aren't going to buy a new console/zelda game if it doesn't have Midna. Which is the logical extension of your comment.

Naturally, you *could* have meant you won't buy Zelda 2015, but you *will* buy Zelda 2018 or w/e. But that's not the logical extension of your comment.

&gt;While you're at it notice that I was replying to a comment about zelda 2015.... the one that isn't out yet on a system that I don't own.

And that you aren't going to buy it if it doesn't have Midna. Why would any other Zelda game be different? No Midna, no buy. Right?

&gt;Second compare TP to wind waker. 

Wind Waker is darker thematically. TP is darker artistically. It's not that difficult.

&gt;How about this, TP is darker... happy now?

Thematically? Not really IMO. Artistically? Sure.

It's a huge difference. Majora's Mask is literally the one that marks it. Thematically dark. But Artistically really light (like OoT). It creates that unique environment which is why it's so popular.

TP is artistically dark, but thematically is pretty much identical to OoT. AKA, not really all that dark."
139754,"So if the Zelda afterwards doesn't contain Midna, you'll still buy it? Seems completely illogical."
192588,"&gt; Sure, I mean it's completely logical to buy a whole game, and a whole system for a single game that doesn't even have the elements I'm fond of.

?

Zelda 2015 doesn't have Midna = no buy.

Zelda 2017 doesn't have Midna = buy.

What? That doesn't make any sense at all.

Also, you can't be sure of what 'elements' Zelda U has anyway, since all that's been shown is a teaser trailer."
