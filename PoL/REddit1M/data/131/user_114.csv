23448,"WW was short, and I'm the minority in this, but I didn't find any enjoyment in sailing around endlessly to explore. Never bothered to beat it 100% because even with the swift sail it was just so *boring* sailing through endless ocean. 

Still a good game though. But TP is my favorite, OoT close behind. "
