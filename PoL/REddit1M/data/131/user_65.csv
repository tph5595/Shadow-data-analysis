6453,"I think that's the major problem. Most people haven't played this game in a long time. They've forgotten how low resolution the textures originally were, so this updated TP:HD looks closer to their memories than it was in reality.

Plus the low resolution, composite video of the GCN/Wii helped hide the ultra-low resolution textures.

Majora's Mask 3DS had a similar problem: They did such a good job updating the graphics without changing how you remembered it, that people were blind to how much it improved.

If you play TP on an emulator at 1080p, it just looks... BAD. Very bad.

TP:HD at minimum doubled, in some places quadrupled the texture sizes, and major characters have updated models, as well as being in what looks to be 1080p.

Also not to forget this is the first time the un-mirrored Hyrule/lefty link will be available in widescreen.

Edit: Clarification"
