26752,"although im really pumped Nintendo's doing an HD remake of the game, the debut footage (and im pretty sure i can speak for the majority here) was really underwhelming. granted, this was only the announcement footage so im sure itll look better in future update videos but for now, i wasnt that impressed. 

When they first announced WWHD, i was so hyped/excited/amazed how they took a game that looked already great and made it even better significantly. i knew i had to buy a wii u just to play it (and i did).

even watching/looking the TP comparison screenshots, it didnt look all too different. the textures were updated and everything looked clear (no more of the hazy looking aesthetic). For me, i actually prefer the somewhat blurriness  because it adds to TPs overall aesthetic for its theme with the twilight realm inter dwelling with hyrule. i think its fair for all of us to not give a finalized opinion until we see more footage/gameplay. for all we knew, it could of been unfinished footage.
