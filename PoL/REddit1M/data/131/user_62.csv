5682,"This is honestly the best news to me, even better than the HD remaster. I've been wanting to play Twilight Princess on my Wii U, don't have a Wii anymore. And my main complaint with it at release on the Wii was the controls and the mirrored world. Gerudo Valley is not in the east, dammit!"

87800,Exactly right. That's literally the only reason they did it lol

The sword was just so, so bad, and you were using it all the time obviously, so it definitely stands out as a huge annoyance in my memory of playing the game. I've played all the other console Zeldas at least 5 times minimum, I only played through Twilight Princess twice."
