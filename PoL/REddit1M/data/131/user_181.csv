64153,"MM3D is vastly improved because it's a remake. This is just a port. It's going to look almost the same as running it on Dolphin, except now you can have legit 16:9 without using the inferior mirrored version of the game or without using the buggy widescreen hack. 

Edit: After some research, the HD version indeed has higher rez textures."
