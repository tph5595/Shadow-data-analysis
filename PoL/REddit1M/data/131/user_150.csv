37906,"I agree that TP was a fantastic game and I really hate how the current turnstile in the Zelda fandom is set to disliking it - but just wait, the way this community changes their minds TP will be the best game ever invented again within a year or two.

I don't think it tops OoT, but it is definitely better than WW (which I still thoroughly enjoyed btw)."
38077,"You and I share the same taste in Zelda games, which is pretty distinctly different to most of the rest of the community. 

Most people around here currently hate TP. I say currently because this community changes their mind more than their underwear, so it will become popular again some time soon."
65480,"I loved the story, the giant world, the fight mechanics, and some of the awesome new weapons. I find fighting even Darknuts in TP to be more satisfying than fighting bosses in most other games. Don't even get me started on the final ""final"" fight against Ganondorf in Hyrule Field. Ugh, such a good game."
99821,"You must be new here. Every single time when the ""rank your fav game"" threads come up - TP is very far towards the bottom of most peoples lists. When the people who like it question why - the best anyone can usually come up with is: ""It's brown"". 

Edit: Typo."
100544,"I actually like the intro to TP quite a lot, but if this is a reason people dislike TP then it's incredibly hypocritical of them - considering MM has one of the most tedious and drawn out introductions (before you can escape Clock Town) from just about the entire franchise - and MM is typically everyone's favourite game right now."
101698,"&gt; anytime someone says something negative about the game they get down-voted

Prove it?

[Here's just one of the fav game threads.](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1w4h1u/what_are_your_top_5_favorite_zelda_games/) In 45 parent comments, TP only makes the **TOP FIVE** 25 times, that's only 55% of people who consider it worthy of a top 5 finish. Out of this list, 8 consider it their fav, that's 17%.

These numbers are pretty far apart from ""the fanbase by large considers it to be amazing"".

OoT gets 82% approval

WW gets 73% approval

Even the polarising MM gets 60% approval

I have spent far too much time to make this point, but I stand by the fact that TP is extremely under-appreciated around here currently. Though considering how fickle this place is, as soon as the HD remake is released it will *suddenly* be everyones favourite again."
