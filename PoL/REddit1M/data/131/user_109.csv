55026,"Functionally, the combat was fine. I could get the proper commands out ten times out of ten. But to me, it just FELT bad. The commands aren't as tight, since the game takes more time to recognize movement than to recognize a button input. The gameplay isn't hard enough to make that an actual issue, but it feels loose and a little sloppy. 

If they put in gyro controls for bow/clawshot, I think it'll be a happy medium. "
