7153,They should make the game a lot harder. The bosses were disappointingly easy
21427,"Dude in the Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask the bosses at least had some degree of difficulty in them. Don't ruin games for us all because they're too hard for you weak worthless worms.

Who remembers the Drum Boss in OoT or Goht in MM? Sure they weren't hard, but they weren't stupidly weak like the bosses in TP.
