4976,Not like Dolphin exactly. It's like Dolphin with a texture boost mod. [Here you go](http://imgur.com/gallery/9BxomtU)
5111,"I'd love this, assuming they make an option for silencing the nagging of Fi. The game would flow and feel *so* much better with just that."
5210,"I don't know why you were down voted. Anyone who was paying attention at the time would know you were right, and the release date is only ""2016"" so far. It could be *next* Christmas for all we know."

5638,"Oh, I must have missed that. Well whatever. The visible Polygon edges don't concern me at all. [The game is ranked #66 out of every game ever reviewed by a publication](http://www.gamerankings.com/wii/928519-the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess/index.html). The graphics being perfect aren't important in a game this good."
6439,"Changed gameplay as well. What you can expect is Wii U game pad controls similar to WWHD. They have added some kind of Amiibo support as well, though, and we don't know what that is. There's no telling what other additions they have made, either, like Hero Mode as a choice from the start, which has sort of become a recent staple in Zelda games.

Whatever else, who knows?"
7289,"I don't see any evidence yet to either new or archived textures. I've been looking over a few scenes for something like an extra painted on hole or stitch where there used to not be, but they look pretty identical."
7645,"And it probably also depends on the Amiibo feature. If it turns out to be really nice, and the way it links to Zelda Wii U also ends up being cool, that might make a lot of people want it."
14347,"Yeah I made that. Sorry I meant that they look identical in design, not in graphics. Which means I can't tell if it's archived textures that in the original release or dull down"
14348,"Yeah I made that image. Lol. 

Sorry I meant that they look identical in design, not in graphics. Which means I can't tell if it's archived textures in the original release which were dulled down to work on the GC and Wii. It's very common in the industry to do that. If that's the case, these might just be the true original textures before filling them down.

If we can find an extra hole in Zany's mask, or something like that, though, it would mean it's a new or upgraded texture instead of the originals.

See what I mean?"
