25802,"I recently finished the Wii version and a lot of the game felt ""foggy"" because of poor lighting and low resolution textures. I think this looks like a huge improvement so far from what I've seen and if they tweak the gameplay in spots as well then personally I think it will be well worth it to pick up. Plus it will be nice to not have to use the Wii version controls.

In general, a someone who recently finished it on the Wii, I'm still pretty excited to grab this and play through again as the visual style just begged for better textures and some lighting touch ups to achieve the atmosphere it really wanted."
