54499,"I played both versions and i always found the Wii controls to be superior, the bow is much better, but the clawshots are even better. The GC version just feels so much slower any time you have to aim at anything, IMO. Fighting wise i didnt have any issues with the motion controls, they didnt really add anything but i always felt that my commands were followed to a tee. "
