52047,Christ this is going to be like playing a new game then. In 100% use to the Wii version and rely heavily in muscle memory to get me through half the shit anymore.

However, i loved the graphic style, enemy and character design, as well as a bunch of story elements so I was enjoying it enough to mark it as one of my favorite Zelda games. However, i doubt anything could beat my first, ALTTP."
