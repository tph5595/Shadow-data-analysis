36895,Well there are new aspects to the game through amiibo and it has not yet been stated what that might entail as well as the save data influencing Zelda Wii U. I wish that there was more done too graphicly but it is already one of my favourite in the Zelda series so it is still a must have for me. And honestly I would rather have a LoZ TP HD that isn't super HD in exchange for not delaying the new upcoming title any further.
