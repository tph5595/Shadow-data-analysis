The textures on the models look sharper, yes, I didn't actually say they didn't.  The models have not improved though. Do you know the difference between textures and models? Do you have any 3D graphic design education?

Pretty funny how your misinformed comment gets upvoted, yet my comment which states the facts gets downvoted. "
