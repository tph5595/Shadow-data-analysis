Still, this should have been the game that pushed the Wii U to its limits. Twilight Princess went for realistic graphics and it should have looked amazing on the Wii U. Instead, we got an HD remake that makes Wind Waker HD look better. I'm really disappointed as a huge Twilight Princess fan that they didn't go all out on it. This game seriously would have made me have bought a Wii U if it'd looked gorgeous."
