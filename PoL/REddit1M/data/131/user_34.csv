I also think that the lighting could have gotten a revamp. 

Thinking back to the tech demo for the WiiU that featured a Zelda scene I can not imagine why they wouldn't try to make it look similar. The models in the tech demo were already from Twilight Princess so why stick with a simple retexture? I don't get this."

Nintendo sold out one of their best games to a simple company so that they could make a quick buck. No love for the game anymore. "
