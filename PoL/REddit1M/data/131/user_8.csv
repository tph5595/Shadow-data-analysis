615,yeah it really does
1359,"Hmm, the update from wii to wii u you mean? It looks higher resolution, but from memory the textures look the same as well as the poly count. You think those are updated a bit too?"
1739,"yeah but they added a lot of tricks in there to make WWHD appear better than it was. in this instance it looks only a bit better than upscaling. I wasn't hoping for higher poly count myself, but the textures look as bad as they always have. even when i first got twilight princess the textures were pretty bad and it seems they haven't updated them save a few, the one i noticed was zeldas dress texture from the footage"
3669,no.... they definitely did
