16281,"I mean, I'm actually replaying the game right now with my GF, since it's one of her favorite games, and this HD remix doesn't look NEARLY as impressive as Wind Waker HD looks. All of the things they did to make WWHD look better worked brilliantly for the art style and the colors. Sure, some of the new textures do look a lot better in the trailer, but they didn't make that big of an impact.

One of TP's biggest problems for me playing it now is just how bad some of the models are. I wish they would have taken it a step further and created better models as well as revamping the textures. The transformation from Link to Wolf Link looks absolutely awful, and Wolf Link's fur looks really bad after seeing how good Midna and her facial animation looks...

Idk, I'm excited, but not nearly as excited as I was after seeing WWHD. I'd much rather see Super Mario Sunshine HD, as I feel that would look absolutely stunning if they used whatever lighting they did in WWHD."
