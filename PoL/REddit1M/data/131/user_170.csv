57333,"Agreed. The original TP was one of the least enjoyable LoZfor me. If they had remade it from the ground up I would consider investing, but it was to much of an auditory and visual flop for my taste. Lame repetitive enemies (the Twilight creatures you had to face to open portals, poor variety of bokoblins, and those annoying twilight birds) made it not even feel like a Zelda game."
