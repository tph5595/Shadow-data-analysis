20358,My main beef with Skyward Sword was how forced the motion controls felt; I loved them in the combat but I hated them in the puzzles. I don't see how a remake would work if they weren't going to use Wii Remotes and those often feel dated on Wii U already so I'm not sure I see any NX games requiring them.
