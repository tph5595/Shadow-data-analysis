3190,And now they're almost out of 3D Zelda games to remake!  **HA!**  Is this trend over yet or are we going to remake OoT again next?
4110,"I can't wait for it to be over, but I know it will never end.

Remakes are eternal.  We're gonna see a Zelda U remake for the NX in 2018, I just know it.

We'll see Zelda NX get remade for the NX 6 months after it comes out."
13744,Because everybody screamed for remakes at the top of their lungs.
