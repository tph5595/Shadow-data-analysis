1817,Yep I 100% agree with you. That's why i'm bummed that its just a hd upscale.
2444,"Ya. I noticed the same thing. I own The GameCube version. Tried the wii version, But having already played the GameCube version, The reversed map just annoyed me. 

I wonder if they will have it as a option seeing as a lot of people played the wii version."
6114,"Yep. It's to early to tell. The trailer could have been a sort of ""Proof of concept"".  

It would be helpful to know how many people are working on it.

A full remake would involve remodeling all the characters. And at least parts of the environment. Amusing Nintendo keeps archives of the Textures, Then the only other thing is updating the rendering engine. Which Will need new bump and specular mapping.

Hard to tell if it's doable in 4 months without knowing the number of people working on it.

Guess we will just have to wait and see."
6444,Nice catch. I wonder if they are new textures or if Nintendo was able to pull HD textures from There Archives.
