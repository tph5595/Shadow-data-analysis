30074,"Although I wouldn't consider the graphical boost to be as remarkable as Ocarina of Time 3D and Majora's Mask 3D's upgrade, there are some major texture and color improvements. They're especially notable when you compare them side-by-side. Someone posted [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaW_0Z_Y95A), which does an excellent job demonstrating the changes.

* [0:00](https://youtu.be/QaW_0Z_Y95A) - There's a clearer model of Link and a significantly less muddy ground texture.
* [0:01](https://youtu.be/QaW_0Z_Y95A?t=1s) - Don't even try to convince me that the shrubbery looks anything like the original GC/Wii version. They actually look like *individual leaves* this time!
* [0:04](https://youtu.be/QaW_0Z_Y95A?t=4s) - Midna's model, like Link's, is less blurry. Also, the individual stones in the wall can now be seen, whereas the previous wall has a much murkier texture.
* [0:05](https://youtu.be/QaW_0Z_Y95A?t=5s) - Even though Wolf Link's polygons are more noticeable, there's more visibility in the scene overall.
* [0:27](https://youtu.be/QaW_0Z_Y95A?t=27s) - Individual stitching can be seen on Zelda's dress (it is also present on Zant's clothing).

No, it does not look ""exactly the same."" I can understand being disappointed by the lack of new features, but *come on*."
