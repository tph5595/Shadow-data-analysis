26007,"My personal favorite is Skyward Sword and I feel like Ocarina was the biggest breakthrough for the series but I think the title for best game in the series would have to go to Majoras Mask.

It has the best atmosphere out of any Zelda, arguably the best story (although I think SS beats it there) and the entire concept of the 3 day cycle was genius and was implemented extremely well. I've never been so compelled to collect so many things in a Zelda game either. Masks are much more rewarding than heartpieces and bottles which are Zeldas go to rewards. "
