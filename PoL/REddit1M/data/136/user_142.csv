34153,"I always base my choice for the best Zelda Game almost entirely on how successful the story is at being engaging and mysterious. As a result my #1 has been and will remain The Wind Waker.

I think the Hero of Time's story (OoT&gt;Majora's Mask&gt;Twilight Princess) is the strongest and most interesting, but Wind Waker is like the LOTR of Zelda Games in that both the characters and the world itself were full of mystery and wonder. Every time I replay it, I hope I find something new about it that I managed to miss if only to make the world seem more real and understandable.

My greatest dissapointment with zelda to this day is that WW hasn't received a console sequel."
