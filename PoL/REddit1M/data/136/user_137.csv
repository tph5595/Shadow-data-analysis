33265,"I think you should make a second version of the poll where each vote is weighted proportionally to the number of Zelda games the voter has played. There's no getting around the fact that ""best"" is completely subjective here, but IMO it would be a good idea to give much more weight to a vote for *Ocarina of Time* from someone who has played all 15 of those games versus a vote for *Ocarina of Time* from someone who has only played that and *Majora's Mask*."
