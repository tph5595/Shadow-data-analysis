It, along with Majora's and Link's Awakening, really expanded the audience for the series. "
42955,"Back when it came out, most NPCs were essentially info dumps with two frames of walking animation. Link's Awakening changed that. It wasn't just that they all had defined personalities, it was that they had lives - even just watching kids play ball in a tiny Gameboy screen felt surreal. 

It could have stopped there, and it would still be remembered, but it didn't...

Talking to Marin about her plans for the future, listening to her song, which sounds like a Gameboy dreaming of something bigger...

It turned every limitation of the medium into a strength. 

This was also a time before the internet. Before gaming crossovers. As you went through the world, the slowly increasing references to Super Mario Bros, the random moments of WTF darkness, made it all seem dreamlike, almost, but not quite, breaking immersion.  

And then the game tells you that you're going to end the world.

You're no longer Link, the protector. 

You're Link, the boy who will play the last song the people you've met will ever hear. And they will simply be erased, because they weren't real to begin with..."
