And imo, WW definitely has TP beat in terms of innovation and execution. "

Even Skyward Sword, where the floating city felt a bit forced as a ""look how different this Zelda game is,"" I found more enjoyable since it was at least different, exciting, and the origin story aspect definitely hooked me. 

I can appreciate that people love TP, I just had a different experience with the game :)"
