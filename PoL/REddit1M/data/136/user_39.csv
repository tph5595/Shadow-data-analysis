14731,We got some REAL young people here that dont love LTTP and Links Awakening.  I mean I love MM and OoT but respect the classics man 
22729,"I think its awesome the younger generation loves zelda. I get the nostalgia of your first zelda game. Ill never forget getting alltp and links awakening in consecutive christmases. I just love them because there was no 'youtube it to figure it out' i find they have made the newer games not so hard that you get stuck so players don't just watch a walkthrough. Back then tough shit, call this number for a hint. I miss those days. Windwaker was too easy IMO as was every one after that though skyward sword had some doozy puzzles. Almost voted that one as it was my fav since MM, which was the last of the near impossible. Everyone used to bitch about the OoT water temple clearly read the prima strategy guide to get through the Zora Temple. OoT while great was also a little easy to me. I want zelda back that you got so mad at you hd to walk away from until you got to school and found out how your friends did it"
22822,"Well thats just a mistake, but to each his own. I like AlBW but gimme both ports for 3ds any day and i will always have a spot for minish cap"
