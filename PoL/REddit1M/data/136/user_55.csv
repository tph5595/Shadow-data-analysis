17506,"Out of the 3D Zelda games, it is my favorite behind Majora's Mask easily. I love that it brought needing to develop skill back to the franchise, which started spiraling deeper into the games just being sequences of puzzles starting around Link to the Past/Ocarina of Time. It's reminiscent of the old Zelda games in this way. It's hard for me to vote for something other than Majora's Mask, though, which was something of an abnormality among the Zelda games in its level of depth and intelligence. After that, it's a close call between the original Legend of Zelda and Link to the Past. "
