29433,"I ranked MM highest, i've always felt it had the extra layer of darkness that the Zelda series needed.
For my top 3 I'd go
1. MM
2. TP
3. OOT

I noticed Wind Waker is up there, I've tried on 2 different ocassions to finish it and I just couldnt make it. I'm not sure what it is, but I couldn't finish Skyward Sword either. The only thing they have in common is that they both have a kind of empty overworld."
