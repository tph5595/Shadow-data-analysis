16366,For me it's the amount of side quests. Side Quests are always my favorite part of any video game and Wind Waker has so many fun ones like the ghost ship or spying on the girl stealing from the vault.
16460,"The atmosphere, music, side quests, both over worlds, dungeons, bosses. Everything in that game is so memorable."
16704,"Its just such a flawed game. Out of all the Zelda games its the only one that reuses only three areas, two bosses three times each, has no overworld connecting everything, a three hour prologue, and Fiiiiiiiii. To it's merit though I loved the upgrading system, some of the bosses were amazing, the story was nice, and the motion control was a good idea."
16738,Which Zelda game is your favorite?
17163,"Wait, wouldnt those be nostalgia lol. Those all came out before Twilight Princess. (good list though)"
17479,"Oh, duh lol."
34555,"There was just so much of it and for only three areas! How many times do you visit the same area? First temple, silent realm, going to retrieve some item, second temple (or revisiting the first one), search for the dragon songs.

35063,Oh sorry lol.

48787,"I really dont think in five years people are suddenly going to just forget all the flaws Skyward Sword has. Its appropriately liked as are all the games. Some people like it and many dont and thats fine. No one has to like every game. Wind Waker and Twilight Princess on the other hand were very well received when they came out and clearly still are, even if if some people dont like them. Hell, A Link Between Worlds gets nothing *but* praise.
 
Saying its because of some cycle just cheapens our opinons."
50888,"But people still have the same complaints. People dont like the sailing in Wind Waker. Its long and tedious and thats why Nintendo fixed it for the HD version (Wind Waker is my favorite Zelda fyi). And its very common for people to not like the 3 day cycle for Majoras Mask or find it to intimidating to play because of it.

 But those games were still highly received and are still today. Nobody's overlooking the flaws now its just that those flaws werent detrimental enough to hate the game for a lot of people. 

I cant accept that Zelda is some contrary to the rule and that people will suddenly be ok with everything Skyward Sword did wrong. Besides, apparently Twilight Princess hasnt passed this cycle yet and its been out for almost 10 years!

It true that nostalgia will always have a hand in how we perceive games but I'll bet anything that if Zelda U is anywhere near as good as Ocarina, Majora, or Wind Waker it'll get the appropriate amount of praise. Even if there is a complaint or two. Well at least thats my 2 cents (four paragraphs)"
51802,"Wait, so you think praise for Wind Waker only started four years ago? That is insanity."
