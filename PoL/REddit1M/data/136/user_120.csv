29975,"non-gamers won't know any titles, if you ask someone who hasn't played a zelda game which character is ""zelda"" they will say ""the guy with the green hat"". n64 is too old of a system for an average casual fan to have played, and both the system and the game cartridge are becoming quite rare.

it really does seem like you pulled this entire comment out of your ass. the most iconic and widely recognized title by far is without a doubt WW because of its unique art style and the fact that it just relaunched. nintendo markets towards kids under 16 and the only people who give a shit about OoT are adult fans, a comparatively small demographic."
