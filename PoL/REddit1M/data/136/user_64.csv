18691,"It's been said throughout the internet, but it really depends on the age you were when you first played the game. For me:

1. OoT, played at age 13
2. Link to the Past, played at age 12 (got me into Zelda)
3. Twilight Princess, played at age 16
4. Majora's Mask, played at age 21
5. Windwaker, played at age 22
6. Skyward Sword, played at age 20"
