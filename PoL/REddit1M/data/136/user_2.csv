2046,"I don't know if it will be possible for any game at all to ever pass the Wind Waker for me. The atmosphere, the music, the smoothness of the combat, the charming story, the most lovable and cute incarnation of Link, the simple but engrossing dungeons, the most realistic and believable Ganondorf, and God DAMN, those beautiful cel-shaded graphics...

In my opinion, the Wind Waker is the epitome of the 3D Zelda formula that OoT created. Truly a masterpiece."
27887,"While I can agree the scrapped dungeons could have made the game more fleshed out, I'm one of those people who enjoyed the triforce quest. I don't know if it's possible to explain why, because it is, as a general idea, bad game design... Maybe it's nostalgia, maybe it's the feeling of being an epic treasure hunter, I'm not sure. But I loved it all the same. 

I totally agree about the reaction commands, but there's something else about the combat to me that just seems perfect... I think with TP and SS, they gave links sword a more realistic feel of cutting through the flesh of the enemy, where you can almost ""feel"" the connection of the blade, whereas WW's combat just felt so damn fluid. Maybe it's always been my imagination, but to me, Wind Waker had the perfect combat system for a third person action game. "
