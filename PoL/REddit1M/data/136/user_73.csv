20149,"To be fair, it's not just this sub. OoT is the simply the most famous/iconic game; it's the one non-gamers are most likely to have heard of, and the one that even the most casual of Zelda fans have played."
40306,"They're adult fans now, but OoT was the definitive Zelda game when gaming really started to become a household thing. Due to gaming's increasing popularity, more and more parents bought their kids video game consoles, which means more kids than ever before were exposed to the Zelda franchise. That same group of fans still exist today (in much greater numbers than you want to accept, I think) even if they're ""a comparatively small demographic"".
Also, OoT has been re-released on every single console since the N64, meaning that every modern Zelda fan has a chance to play it.

If you have a different opinion than me, that's fine, but your comment is pulled out of your own ass just as badly, if not more."
