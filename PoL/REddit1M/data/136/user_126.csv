30115,It's like the same people who hate on Mario 2 for not being formulaic.
32052,I think ALBW is better but I had a few gripes about it.

You don't have to make the game look piss yellow and shit brown in order to make the mood darker."
33450,Wait so backtracking is seen as a bad move? 
34905,"Oh ok so you had to backtrack a lot.

I thought it was the opposite."
35578,"* The Item Renting System. It's pretty convenient but it sacrifices the exploration aspect that made Zelda games for what they are. I think instead of having all the items in one location, they can be purchased or rented in a bunch of different shops. Non-necessary items can be placed in semi-secret locations.

* Chests containing Rupees are not very exciting. It would be better if the Rupees were seen outright and not placed in chests.

* Lorule had lots of lore potential. It could have had more characters, side quests, and dialogue than what it got. I know Ninty was going for a ALTTP vibe but they could've done something just a little different.

* The game wasn't exactly difficult. The Treacherous Tower was a step in the right direction but I think there could've been a little more difficult side quests.

* Lorule having quarantined sections. It's a hassle."

Not unknown, just different shops. And there's nothing wrong with exploring. What makes it a hassle is having to go through different portals in order to explore the same world. I'd rather have Lorule not be sectioned off. It's a hassle with no items or rewards waiting at the end besides game progression.

&gt;worth it

I meant that the rupees should remain where they are minus being hidden by chests. They're important, but the false excitement given by the chests can be annoying."

Now what they could do is have small chests contain Rupees while larger chests contain more important items."
