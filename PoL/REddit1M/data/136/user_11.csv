7417,"Voted for Twilight Princess. If OoT is the Star Wars of gaming, than TP is The Empire Strikes Back: deeper, darker, bigger, more engaging, and takes what made OoT/ANH so good and brings it up to eleven.

It's a bit saddening to see WW getting more support here and elsewhere, but I suppose TP's time in the Zelda cycle hasn't come yet. I haven't played WW yet, but it seems more like Return of the Jedi: brighter and more kid-friendly without compromising the overall quality, and giving more depth and sympathetic traits to the villain while killing him off for once and for all. And you have the requisite annoying characters (Tingle and Ewoks)."

39021,"From what I heard, WW is definitely a more ""unconventional"" Zelda game. Whereas it diverged from OoT's formula and forged its own identity, TP followed OoT's patterns and built on everything that made it good. It's more or less a bigger, better ""Ocarina of Time 2""."
39174,"It's totally canon, but yeah. I'd say it doesn't equate to Empire because it doesn't follow the main Link/Zelda/Ganon story."
39226,"I agree. I plan on playing Wind Waker eventually, but need to beat TP first (and *maybe* some of its sidequests)."
62508,"I played both, and TP is the better one by far. ALttP is much less engaging than the 3D Zeldas in general, let alone the biggest, deepest one yet, but it's still a good game."
