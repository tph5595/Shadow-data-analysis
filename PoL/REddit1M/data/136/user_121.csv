I'd love to have another part in that series."
29728,I have a lot of nostalgic love for Zelda 2. I've been sick basically my whole life and I spent a lot of time in the pediatric ward of my hometown's local hospital when I was growing up. they had an NES that was donated with a bunch of games by the Optimists Club. Zelda 2 and Mario 2 were the ones I played a lot of.
