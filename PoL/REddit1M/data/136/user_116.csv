28983,"LoZ was not the first Zelda i played but it is still my favorite.  I am 26 but played around 5 or 6 games in the series before trying the original.  No idea why i waited so long.  I did both adventures in a few days and I got so into it that I had to map out Ganon's dungeon in the 2nd quest... that place is a fucking maze.  It is my go to Zelda game to just pick up and play, it drops you right in without any info and off you go.  It is the most difficult, outside of Adventure of Link, and the most cryptic which is one of the big reasons i love it so much.  I also love that you can finish part of a dungeon and then have to come back later because you are missing an essential upgrade.  

I understand not everyone likes backtracking but it just makes it more interesting to me because you create your own path and that requires trial and error.  Metroid is my second favorite game series and LoZ is really the only Zelda that gives me similar feelings of sequence breaking and maybe being where you aren't supposed to be. You can essentially go anywhere you want and the extreme difficulty curve between dungeons made that even more chaotic and adventurous. "
