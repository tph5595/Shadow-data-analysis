23122,"I'm more of an OoT fan, but I can completely understand why someone would prefer LttP. I'm really baffled more people voted for Twilight Princess than LttP though..."
23283,"&gt; We got some REAL young people here that dont love LTTP and Links Awakening. I mean I love MM and OoT but respect the classics man

So just because people disagree with you means that they're damn kids who never played LTTP and Link's Awakening who don't know what they're talking about? I played all major Zelda games as they were released since Adventure of Link, and I prefer OoT to LTTP and Link's Awakening... (even though they're very good too)."
