17168,Don't! One day its time will come. The Zelda cycle is still very much in full swing.
49548,"People [read: forums, not unlike this sub] treated every 3D Zelda besides ocarina the same way upon release. Skyward is still the newest Zelda, and thus gets the same treatment. You say people ""won't forget the flaws"", but take a look at Majora- it was criticized by the fanbase when it was still new-a big criticism was the small amount of dungeons- but now it's one of the most ~~circlejerked~~ loved games in the franchise. Wind Waker- a lot of people pointed out how slow sailing was, and again- look at the almost universal praise it receives. The general opinion of Skyward Sword  cannot be wholly attributed to the cycle-but it is an extremely influential part."
49768,"I agree with your opinion on Ocarina- it really is the perfect basic Zelda. Which is why I may feel a little... Neutral. In my opinion, the best 3D Zelda is the one that improves the most on ocarina- which really comes down to personal preference. ( the same can be said about ALTTP and the other 2D Zeldas)"
51305,"I'm not saying that the flaws don't go away- because they don't-rather, the popular opinion of the fanbase shifts from criticising to praising. It's perfectly fine to prefer one game over another, and explain why you don't like the other as much- but if this sub were around when Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, Or Majora was released- you would have seen the same treatment of those games that you see now, For Skyward Sword.

P.S.- The Zelda Cycle isn't based on years, rather just the amount of games that have been released. Praise for MM became popular  with the release of TP, and praise for WW with SS. It's all the same."
51945,"No, just when it became the *popular opinion* to praise it. "
