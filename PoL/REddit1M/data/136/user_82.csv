22277,I can't believe anybody would vote for skyward sword.  I'm happy twilight princess is up as high as it is.
22555,Ocarina really didn't fit with how I like to play Zelda games.  I like to go my own pace and explore a bunch.  But I was always getting yelled at.  And I didn't find the overworld missions or characters all that interesting.
23899,I'm still getting yelled at even if I don't respond.
42282,"Funny, I never thought of it like that.  "
42916,"Wasn't ruined.  I still enjoyed it.  Just not one of my favorites.  And again, Navi wasn't the only thing.  I loved the temples, but the rest of it really didn't grab me."
43806,"Oh man, I don't know what to tell you.  I really did hate it.  I still liked the game of course, but oh man.

And I'm not alone, according to http://zeldawiki.org/Navi
Navi is one of the more criticized The Legend of Zelda series characters, which is due to her constant yelling of ""Hey!"" and ""Listen!"" throughout the game and for giving ""unsolicited advice.""

And that's all I'm saying, not that's it's not a good game.  Just that Navi is just one of a few things that keeps this game from being at the top of my Zelda list."
