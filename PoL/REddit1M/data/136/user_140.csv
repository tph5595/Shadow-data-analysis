The music, the environment, the enemies, the world progression thanks to the time travelling aspect - it's Zelda in its purest form. It's *video games* in their purest form. Every single person, locale and action sequence in OoT was just perfect. OoT is THE game that mastered the art of building a world and a character, and it doesn't bother with anything else.


MM and WW and all the other Zeldas are great for their own reasons, but this is why OoT will always be at the top spot."
