25399,Some of you actually voted for Skyward Sword?!?! Smh
40316,"Well the topic says the best Zelda game. I understand if some people like it but no way In hell it is the best. Next to Zelda 2 and the CDI it is the least Zelda game out there outside of the story, no exploration and the wiimote...ugh.

edit: Hell, Zelda 2 had better exploration than Skyward Sword. "
