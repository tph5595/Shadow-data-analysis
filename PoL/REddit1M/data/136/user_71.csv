19507,Absolutely agree with you. Incredible music and my favorite depiction of Ganondorf. I was so glad to see that they are heading back towards this art style in Zelda U. Realism is great and all but it tends to age poorly. The mix of cel-shading/anime/paintbrush styles will very likely still look great ten years from now.
