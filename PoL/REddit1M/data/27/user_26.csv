23970,"Adult timeline, it never existed in the child timeline which this game most likely takes place because of the direct mentions of twilight princess events."
24059,There are mentions of twilight princess events though so I'm going to say BotW takes place in the child timeline.  Aounuma did say that the timeline placement would be apparent.  so the direct mentions of the hero traveling in twilight to me means child timeline.
24145,"I read somewhere that after link was killed Gannondorf took his piece of courage then took zeldas piece of wisdom, after getting the whole triforce it corrupted him more and turned him into something that represented his heart. a dark monster."
24236,"only in the adult timeline, which this game doesn't take place in considering its a flooded ocean in that timeline."
24626,"I swear in one of the memories she said something about a hero traveling through the sky, time and the ashes of twilight or something, I could be wrong. apparently though. at arbitors grounds there is the mirror of twilight shattered, I have yet to find the mirror though, I haven't killed the boss so I'm not really going over there."
26443,Dang it Nintendo please just give us a definitive answer. ugh.
26804,Well there goes my whole theory. RIP.
27552,"I had this crazy theory about the timeline before I played the game, being this link is from OoT died in battle with gannon and was put into the chamber to be resurrected but in that time his Zelda died and her daughter would be the one you saved.  then the king told us the back story and I was so upset."
27894,I don't know why they would mention it if it wasn't supposed to be a reference. seems weird to me.
84593,I'm honestly about to give up on the timeline.  My head canon is still after twilight princess.  I don't know why they would name drop the embers of twilight and not have it take place after. As I have said it was said the placement would be apparent.  That's apparent to me.
