17243,"In the same quote, Zelda also says that it was also used to travel through time. This never happened in the child timeline so it's hard to take the quote as proof of anything."
18602,So it's ok to explain that reference away but not the one about twilight? I thought we were applying Occams razor here?
20398,"It's honestly hard to say. I feel like this quote throws a wrench in the timeline discussion. I think all signs points to BotW occurring in the Downfall timeline with the exception of the Twilight reference. Since this game takes place so far in the future, it's not hard to imagine another twilight incident happening in this amount of time. 

There just seems to be more evidence supporting Downfall. There's the sages, Ruto specifically who was said to have fought Ganon alongside the Hero. It also seems that Ganon has been a constant threat to Hyrule in this timeline, which fits right into Downfall. There's also a quote by Kass which I find people have overlooked. When you talk to him at the stables, he's playing Epona's song and says the ancient Hero played the same song to call his horse. Child Link was never remembered as a hero, so it's hard to believe that's the one he was referring to."
24722,It really isn't much cleaner or easier. We still need to make assumptions and ask more questions if this is the CT. It just seems odd that the details of adult Link's adventure in OoT would be passed down as legend when none of those events would have technically taken place. Especially when we consider how Ruto fits in because it seems that the story of her is taken more as fact rather than the story of what could have been.
