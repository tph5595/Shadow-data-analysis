24255,"It's not a direct mention, it only says that the sword was ""steeped in the glowing ashes of twilight"", no explicit statement about the story of TP. The Twilight Realm existed before OoT, so twilight-y stuff could have happened in any timeline. "
24726,"What's more likely: a tale told by a child being remembered well over 10,000 years later, or another interaction with a parallel dimension that has an specifically designed gateway st some point over that same period of time? We can say it's unlikely that there was a second Twilight incursion in the child timeline, because Midna destroyed the Mirror of Twilight at the end of TP, but that same Mirror still existed for an incredibly long time in the other two timelines. We *know* that it's possible for the Twili to come to Hyrule once, so who's to say it couldn't have happened again in a different timeline?"
27603,"The bit I said was the exact wording when it mentioned Twilight. There's nothing to say that was the events of Twilight Princess, only that something involving Twilight happened and a version of Link and the Master Sword were involved. 10,000 years is a very long period of time, and a lot of things can happen.

61460,"Edit: ignore me, wrong Goron. They all look the same to me /racism 

Darunia was the chief of the Gorons at the time of Ocarina of Time, and so was already a significant figure regardless of the timeline.
