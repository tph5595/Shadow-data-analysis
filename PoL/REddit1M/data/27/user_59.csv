Camel is Naboris- Nabooru 

Elephant is Ruta- Ruto

Bird is Medoh- Medli

Lizard is Rudania- Darunia

But there are references to all three timelines in this game.  Lynels have only appeared in the downfall timeline for example and is only known by the name Ganon, and there are many landmarks and hints from TP in BOTW,  as well as the Wolf Link amiibo/TP hearts thing and Beast Ganon resembling the smoke-Ganon roaming around the castle (I haven't finished it so I don't know what other forms he takes). Plus of course there's the speech Zelda is giving in the first memory which references games in all three timelines as well. 

I think that's why they did the '10,000 years ago' thing. My personal guess is this game takes place after any Zelda game we've played so far... It's not quite a [dragon break](http://www.zeldainformer.com/could-breath-of-the-wild-be-a-dragon-break/) but by putting it so far in the 'future' they can get beyond the timeline split and merge them. Maybe some shit happened in the spirit realm, or maybe the spirit realm is shared by all three timelines and Hylia or the 3 goddess or some Triforce wackery caused them to remember the full history and merge the shit. The other possibility is like a marvel alternate earth where similar things happened in one timeline, like in the child timeline the world eventually gets flooded again (causing the Rito to evolve but the Zora remain and the waters recede so Hyrule doesn't relocate), and where downfall haberdashery also evolves (lynels appear but Zora don't turn evil). 

 At any rate I think BOTW doesn't fit in a separate timeline, but takes place well past OOT. I don't know if it really has to. After 10,000+ years I don't even know if it matters."
109282,"oo also main argument against the adult timeline is the master sword and Hyrule which got destroyed in WW. They are clearly back where Hyrule got founded (temple of time, the Great Plateau, Castle Town, etc). The map was clearly based off of a mash between OOT, SW, and TP, all those landmarks like Lon Lon ranch, the Temple of Time, etc etc. should be wiped off the planet even if the sea had receded in time. Also why would the royal family return when they had built such an infrastructure in ST? 

I mean, a lot can happen in 10,000 years, but it would be like say, the Spanish who populated Mexico returned to Spain and rebuilt everything the way it was before they left after 10,000 years. Who would be around to remember? Instead we have something more like London, which has only been around for about 2000 years but has still more or less retained it's original 'shape' and England (which on the whole is much older) more or less retaining the location of it's towns and cities even though some have fallen to ruin and new ones pop up. If England was flooded and repopulated after the floods receded it would look completely different. 

lol as much as logic can be applied to a video game universe. :)"
