85867,Wrong. In other languages you can hear her talking in the background while the champions were chatting. She also referenced Wind Waker and A Link to the Past... So in the same scene she referenced all three timelines. Nice try.
85924,"Yeah, in german she says also 'eine Verbindung mit der Vergangenheit' which translates to 'a link to the past'."
86090,Yes we need to consider her full statement... which goes on in the background as the others were talking. You can hear it at best in the German version. She talks about 'Whather the hero crossed the oceans or made a link to the past'. So the whole cutscene makes references to all three timelines.
86135,The sages did defeat Ganon in the end in the Dawnfall timeline.
86210,Actually Arbiter's Ground was already build in OoT... we just never see it in other timelines. I doubt they did build that whole thing just to ban Ganondorf.
95840,"There is no subtitles for this. She says this in the background while the other champions were talking. It's hard to understand in English, you can hear her talking but not really understand. In German it's better understandable. ""Ob der Held die Meere Ã¼berquert oder eine Verbindung mit der Vergangenheit eingeht.""
""Whether the hero crosses the oceans or makes a link to the past.""
