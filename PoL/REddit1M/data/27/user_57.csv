97084,"Then how do you explain the stone talking about how the Zora's divine beast was named Ruto after the one that helped the *Hero of Time*? There was no hero of time in the child timeline. Also, there is a landmark named after King Daphnes from Wind Waker, which was adult timeline IIRC."

I appreciate you understanding the joke.

&gt;Young Link is the Hero of Time. How could he not be the Hero of Time?

Nobody would've remembered him as Hero of Time in Child Timeline. There was no pulling of MS, no killing of Ganondorf, no awakening of sages. He just went back in time, told Zelda she was right, and ran off with the OoT.

&gt;Just because the incidents and battles of Adult Link technically never happened doesn't mean information of said incidents did not survive. For example: Young Link recounting his adventure to others including Zelda. Zelda repeating said adventures through written or spoken word. A sage, such as Rauru (who we know to have lived for many ages) could have easily recorded and distributed this information. There are various ways for legends to have survived.

This doesn't make much sense. 

1. You assume that Link would give this super-lengthy account to Princess Zelda, which was highly unnecessary, he could've just told her she was right, tell her to give him OoT, and run off. 

2. You assume that Zelda would tell anyone. I very much doubt the King knew about, let alone was onboard with, Link and Zelda's plan of Link running off with the OoT. Why would Zelda sabotage herself and tell the King?

3. That anyone would even believe Zelda. Remember, the King already dismissed Zelda's accusations against Ganondorf. He's definitely not gonna listen to some random kid from the forest. And why would Rauru listen? It could easily be chalked up to a young girl's wild imagination. And why would the Zora believe that crap about their princess, let alone memorialize it on a huge stone plaque? It's not coming from a reputable source, and none of it can actually be proven.

&gt;I consider names of landmarks and minor details such as that to be the developers paying homage to previous games in the series. The words spoken in cinematics and written in texts are chosen very carefully and put in for specific reasons, landmark names and rock salt hold little to no value in comparison.

Your argument for the cutscenes is easily dismissed by the fact that the one reference you think ties together your theory is both vague and contradicted by other references to other timelines.

EDIT: Mobile problems."
