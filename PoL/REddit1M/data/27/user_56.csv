94712,Zelda makes mention of the hero of Twilight in one of the memories
95020,"Where does she say that? I just rewatched this memory and she said nothing like that, and I don't recall any such statement from any other memory. How about a screenshot of where this statement was made?"
95658,"That would make sense as to why he transforms back and forth in some games, but not the ones in the hero is defeated timeline"
95757,"Who needs to ""hear her better"" when everything is subtitled? What she said is not debatable when there are subtitles."
95838,That was my theory too. That you were the defeated hero of time being resurrected. Looks like I was wrong there though.
