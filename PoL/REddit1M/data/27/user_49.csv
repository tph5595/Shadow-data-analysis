63760,"The one thing, confusing me the most, are the Rito and Zora both being present. I thought the Zora evolved into the Rito over time, replacing them eventually previous to Wind Waker. But, while WW being in the Adult timeline, the Zora of BotW bear a close resemblance of the Twilight Princess Zora, being present in the Child Timeline.

Could it be, that the three timelines crash together into one realm and moving landmarks from different parallel universes closer together? In a Dark Souls III kind of way?"
