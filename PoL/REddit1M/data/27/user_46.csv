50356,"IIRC there's also some evidence it takes place in the adult timeline, long after Wind Waker.  Each of the divine beasts are apparently named after sages - Vah Rutah and Vah Nabooris are stated in game to be named after Ruto and Nabooru from OoT, Vah Rudania is presumably named after Darunia, and Vah Medoh would likely be named after Medii from WW, which would seem to imply that BoTW is in the same timeline as WW."

If the Zora got split off into several colonies that couldn't contact one another for a long time it would make sense for them to evolve in different directions - one becoming more like Twilight Princess Zora and one becoming the Rito.  There could have still been Zora around during WW, and they just lived far from where the game took place.

Or it could be more timeline weirdness, who knows?"
