17136,"How do you Occam's Razor your way out of Ruto and Nabooru being sages?

Occam's Razor doesn't mean ""simplify the problem by ignoring contradictory evidence."" It means ""try to avoid unnecessary assumptions."" ALL of the timelines require assumptions."
19180,"I may be mistaken about Nabooru, but the Zora history stones directly refer to Ruto being a Sage. 

&gt;it's quite possible that Link simply 

And it's quite possible that Link had an interaction with the Twilight Realm at some point in any other timeline. Whatever is ""quite possible"" and not ""stated as canon"" is an *assumption,* and like I said: All three timeline placements require assumptions.

&gt; it proves nothing. 

I agree. And neither does the Twilight reference.

&gt;Occam's Razor says ""The simplest solution is most often the right one""

That's not the common interpretation. It's ""among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.""

&gt;I ask again what's simpler Link telling people a story or another unseen clash involving Twilight, Link, and the Master Sword? 

So Link told a story, and though reference to that story is not found in any other Child Timeline game, a small aside of that story (that Ruto was involved) managed to survive tens of thousands of years.

Or the Twilight realm exists, and over tens of thousands of years *anything* happened involving it.

Or how's this for simple: the Twilight reference is one of many easter eggs put in the game for fans to enjoy. See: https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/60fnif/spoilers_timeline_references_in_one_cutscene/?sort=confidence"
23194,"&gt;Ok, let's use the competing hypotheses definition. 
&gt;
&gt;Your hypotheses is that there was a large enough conflict between Link and Twilight that has not ever been referenced in any other game. Your assumptions here are through the roof, to start that this event could have occurred and no body talked about it until now, that an event of this scale could occur without ganon, and if it did have ganon how did he get involved when he was either dead, sealed in the sacred realm, or under the ocean. it's assumption after assumption after assumption. 

I disagree with all of this, sorry. All it takes is for something notable to have happened between the original rise of Calamity Ganon and the latest pre-BotW game. Downfall timeline means any event post-Zelda 2. (Or really post-LBW, since we wouldn't expect the original 2 games to reference lore not written until over a decade later; neither Zelda 1 nor 2 reference Lorule, for instance.) 

It's *not that weird.* The Twilight Realm exists in all timelines. We are at a point very far in the future. 

&gt;How about my hypotheses about Link telling a story. Well we know the Hero of Time spent a lot of time with Zelda after he was sent back in time at the end of OoT and it's pretty safe to assume that he told her about the future, in fact it's improbable to assume he didn't tell everyone so they could stop Ganondorf's Coup as we know they did as he was being executed in TP for that exact crime. It's less of an assumption and more drawing a logical conclusion from existing facts. 

Then why is there no reference to those events in Child Timeline games? Why is the Hero's Shade lamenting that his exploits were not remembered? Even if he told Zelda and  King Hyrule, how has it been remembered by the Zora tens of thousands of years later, when again, no such reference to Ruto exists in the child timeline?

It *could* be that way, but right now it's an *assumption.* And it's not the only one.

Kokiri must have come to be Koroks for some different reason than in WW.

Rito must have evolved in some different way than in WW.

The Lost Woods must have moved to the same location as in LttP, for a different reason. 

Ganon must have somehow escaped the Four Sword, though there is no reference to the Four Sword in the plot.

You have to assume things in order to resolve all of these issues with the Child Timeline - and when your only piece of exclusive evidence is a spoken reference to Twilight, a Child Timeline placement is no Occam's Razor solution. None of the timelines offer a ""simple"" solution."
