&gt; While I agree that Mirror of Twilight definitely existed before Twilight Princess (the wiki states as much), Zelda's full statement in the ceremony needs to be considered.

&gt; ""Whether skyward bound, adrift in time, or steeped in the glowing embers of twilight...the sacred blade is forever bound to the soul of the Hero.""

&gt; The subjects in her statement are being listed because they directly involve both the Master Sword and the soul of the Hero, obviously Link. What other event involving both the Twilight Realm and Link could this possibly be in reference to?

Edit: Formatting."

Now then:

* Young Link is the Hero of Time. How could he not be the Hero of Time?

* Just because the incidents and battles of Adult Link technically never happened doesn't mean information of said incidents did not survive. For example: Young Link recounting his adventure to others including Zelda. Zelda repeating said adventures through written or spoken word. A sage, such as Rauru (who we know to have lived for many ages) could have easily recorded and distributed this information. There are various ways for legends to have survived.

* I consider names of landmarks and minor details such as that to be the developers paying homage to previous games in the series. The words spoken in cinematics and written in texts are chosen very carefully and put in for specific reasons, landmark names and rock salt hold little to no value in comparison."
