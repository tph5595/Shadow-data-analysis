10206,"No, it takes place in the child timeline. There are very clear references to Twilight Princess, which could only be in that branch of the timeline.

Edit: Hey guys, thanks for downvoting me when I'm stating a simple fact. That will sure teach me to try and have a discussion. Fuck me right?"
15517,"She references Twilight in relation to the hero and the master sword. It is clearly Twilight Princess. Occom's Razor, it's simpler to say that she's referring to that than a completely different encounter with Twilight, Link, and the Master Sword. "
17831,"Ocarina of Time happened at the split, it's probable that Link told Zelda about his jaunt through time and the story of that was passed down the ages, there's also Majora's Mask where there was quite a lot of time travel. "
18206,"Nabooru was never refereed to as a sage only a ""legend"" I just went back and double checked that. I never found the reference to Ruto (other than the obvious reference in the name of the divine beast) so I don't know if the term ""sage"" was used or not but even if it was it's quite possible that Link simply told people what happened in the adult half of OoT and the legend was passed on. it proves nothing. Occam's Razor says ""The simplest solution is most often the right one"" and I ask again what's simpler Link telling people a story or another unseen clash involving Twilight, Link, and the Master Sword?"
19020,"We are, and I'm still waiting for you to tell me what is the simpler solution, Link telling a story at the end of OoT or a second Twilight War? There are ways for OoT events to leak into any timeline branch because that's where the split occurred however there's no way the legend of the Twilight War could have gotten to the other timeline.

Edit: My apologies I thought this was on a different comment strain, I hadn't posed you that particular question at that point. So I'll do it now. What's simpler Link telling people a story or another unseen clash involving Twilight, Link, and the Master Sword?"
19224,"There is a difference between an easter egg and referencing the events of a previous game. As far as I could find only Oot, SS, and TP were directly referenced by events. OoT and SS happen at or before the split and references to them can be in any timeline however TP is on the child timeline and references to it can only be on that timeline."
21699,"Ok, let's use the competing hypotheses definition. 

Your hypotheses is that there was a large enough conflict between Link and Twilight that has not ever been referenced in any other game. Your assumptions here are through the roof, to start that this event could have occurred and no body talked about it until now, that an event of this scale could occur without ganon, and if it did have ganon how did he get involved when he was either dead, sealed in the sacred realm, or under the ocean. it's assumption after assumption after assumption. 

How about my hypotheses about Link telling a story. Well we know the Hero of Time spent a lot of time with Zelda after he was sent back in time at the end of OoT and it's pretty safe to assume that he told her about the future, in fact it's improbable to assume he didn't tell everyone so they could stop Ganondorf's Coup as we know they did as he was being executed in TP for that exact crime. It's less of an assumption and more drawing a logical conclusion from existing facts. As for the German translation clearly referencing WW you have a very good point there and the only way we can have a definitive answer is looking at the original japanese, however that is something I am unable to do."
22599,"Epona's song was used in MM and it's the tune used on the horse grass in TP. As to the ideas of a second Twilight War and Ruto being remembered as helping Link defeat Ganon I'll pose you the same scenario as I did someone else. It's quite safe to assume that Link told Zelda (and probably lots of other people but that's besides the point) about the future, including Ruto's involvement. Ganondorf was being executed for his coup in the flashback we see in TP so we know he was stopped and we know it has to have been because Link made his plans known, as he is the only temporal variable to change the timeline and we know he wasn't strong enough to beat Ganondorf in combat as a child. OoT was where the timeline split so stories from that point in time can contaminate all of the timeline branches. A second Twilight War forces us to make many more assumptions to try and fit this square peg into a round hole. How did it happen? What sparked it? Why has no one ever referenced it before? What was Ganon's involvement? question after question, assumption after assumption with little to no evidence. It's cleaner, it's easier, it makes more sense for Link to have told the story of his adult experiences than to have a second Twilight War."
23510,"Well I think we can at least agree on your last point, nothing about the Zelda timeline is simple. I'd stay and debate more as I am having fun but I need to go to work. I have had a good time with this, I hope we can pick this up another time."
37327,"Of course not, I love getting in fierce debates. I'm just glad the feeling is mutual."
