198,"Also, it's pretty much cloudy there all the time much like Ganon's Castle in OoT.  "
2373,True... Although it seems BotW could take place in the hero is defeated timeline which could mean ganons castle never imploded.
3802,"Nice I hadn't read that. So its moreso a nod to Ganon's Castle as the architecture and landscape (bridge, geology) are very similar. "
8812,Yeah but can't he change back and forth at will using the Triforce of Power? He does so in Twilight Princess. I don't think the only way he can change into Ganon is by Link defeating his Ganondorf form. And it doesn't seem that once he's in Ganon form he's stuck in that form. He even changes into Agahnim from Ganon and then eventually back into Ganon. 
10605,I think there's references from almost every single Zelda game. To me its Nintendo's way of making BotW the epitome of the series thus far. 
25837,"It's just the opposite of OoT. First you fight Ganon (after possessed Zelda), then you fight Ganondorf last. So I figured Ganondorf has pretty solid control over the transformation between his human and beast carnations. "
84920,"I thought I remembered that cutscene in OoT! I just couldn't find it on youtube. Good points though, this is what I figured given how many times he changes his form in the games."
