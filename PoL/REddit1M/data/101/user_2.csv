921,yes?  nintendo is struggling and miyomoto/aunoma are getting old and probably nearing retirement.  i dont expect zelda to have a strong future and this lack of a game on wii u is a clear sign of that
6603,"i agree with the first half of your comment but the second half is incorrect.  spirit tracks, phantom hourglass, and skyward sword all appear on the wii U virtual console"
9878,well as of right now tri force heroes and a link between worlds are exclusive to 3ds and four swords adventures is exclusive to gamecube
18217,four swords adventures
