17276,"Remakes released years later don't count, the point people are trying to make is that if you want to play a new Zelda game at launch you don't need a Wii U, the same can't be said of any other Nintendo console."
19581,"Exclusive Zelda release is what was said, that means that the Wii U is the only Nintendo console which didn't have a Zelda release which was exclusive to that console at the time of release. When OoT was released on N64 it was exclusive to the N64, when WW was released it was exclusive to the GameCube, when SS was released it was exclusive to the Wii, that sentence can't be said for the Wii U."
22452,"Minecraft was exclusive to PC and Mario Kart 8 was exclusive to Wii U, them coming out on other systems later doesn't retroactively take that away, the fact is for a time those games could only be played on one system, the same can't be said for the Wii U and a Zelda game."
25371,"The sentence ""Minecraft is a PC *exclusive*"" was true in 2010, releasing on 100 different systems since then can't change the fact that it was exclusive. Just like OoT being re-released on GameCube and 3DS can't change the **fact** that it was exclusive to the N64, if you wanted to play OoT in 1998 or 1999 or 2000 or 2001 you needed a N64. And you can't call it a timed exclusive either because nobody knew, not even Nintendo, that it would ever be released on another system. 

The Wii U has not and will not ever have a Zelda game that is not available on another system at the time of release, that is *distinctly* different from OoT now being available on multiple systems."
26029,"Yes, but that was not the point of this post."
26844,"Answer this question, In 1998 did the N64 have a Zelda game that was exclusively on it?

Now change the years and the Nintendo consoles and for every console you will be able to answer yes to that question... except the Wii U, that is the point trying to be made.

Games being rerelease years later once the original console is long out of production doesn't mean anything when it comes to making decisions on what console to buy if you are a Zelda fan it's not anyone skipped the N64 because they could just play OoT and MM on the 3DS instead."
27219,"The post is correct, every other console has had a Zelda game that was exclusive *at* release."
56010,I meant at the release of the game not the console.
