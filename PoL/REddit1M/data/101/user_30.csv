273396,"If you treat the GBC as a separate generation from the Gameboy, Link's Awakening was GB exclusive until a new system was released and it was re-released/updated, making it still count.  If you consider the GB/GBC as the same generation, Link's Awakening was released twice on the 'same' platform and was still GB/GBC exclusive."
276666,"It still doesn't change the fact that it was out on the original Gameboy before the Gameboy color even existed, making it GB exclusive until the DX version came out 1998.  The two versions did not launch side by side.

Would you consider Ocarina of time to not be an N64 exclusive because they released it on the Gamecube with an included master quest later?

The whole argument was about Zelda games which were only available for a single system upon the game's original release.  Re-releases/ports/remakes/VC emulation doesn't change how and when the game was originally available."
339779,"The whole point of the subject is that every Nintendo system, apart from their ""failure"" systems (Virtual Boy, Wii U) have received a Zelda game that was unique to that system at the time of the game's release.  At the time of release, those games were exclusive.  They may not be ""exclusive"" now due to ports/re-releases, but they were at the time.  Later re-releases on other systems don't retroactively change that.  That's all I and many others were trying to say."
