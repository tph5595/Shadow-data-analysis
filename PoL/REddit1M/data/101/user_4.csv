1517,I fail to see any evidence of them learning from their mistakes. They once again go for an underpowered gimmick that will isolate developers. They are launching with a weak library. They are launching without basic features that gamers expect in a console. In what way have they improved? 
8553,Hit me up in a year after its floundering
14438,Except for the fact that it just will not be. Devs are already openly laughing at the console. It will not get the games that sell on other platforms. It will not have the online infrastructure or population needed to thrive. It will be dead in the water and is nothing but a gimmick. And you can also look up dev and industry figure heads and what they think about it. The numbers are not promising.

They will not bring over 3rd party devs for a system that will not maintain an active userbase. And Nintendo does not have the ability to produce a nonstop influx of quality games that will sell their console to make it profitable for devs to make games for it at some point.

Even when the Wii sold a ton nobody wanted to build for it. It was a weak, quirky machine that just happened to ride a fad. It then sat on people's shelves not being played and not attracting interest."
40083,"The wii u had them yet the switch won't at launch. That is unacceptable and will isolate people. A lot of users probably spend an upwards of 50% of their time on a console watching netflix or other media.


And the switch does not have a real online infrastructure that is announced. We know some minimal details about their paid plan. We know that we have to wait half a year to fucking use voice chat. No idea about achivements of any kind. No idea about the user profile experience and how it will work. No idea if their online games will actually have real matchmaking features or highly restrictive ones like Smash had."

You are just wrong in every possible way. "
44503,"When this console fails like the last several Nintendo consoles and continues to isolate them in the industry you can come back, look at this conversation, and realize that you were and will continue to be wrong. "
79295,At least there is somebody else here that isn't delusional
80311,"That is just untrue in every possible way. The Gamecube had amazing games but was commercially a failure and it logistically  crippled the company for years. They chose to neglect online infrastructure and play and are even on record saying online gaming is not the way of the future. 

The Wii sold a lot, but was also a failure when it comes to Nintendo's stance in the market and industry. While it sold a lot, it sold as a fad item. It had the lowest play time of the consoles. It sat on shelves not being used. It was a terribly weak and poorly utilized machine that further isolated developers. 

I will ignore the handheld comments as we are talking about home consoles. Though it can be argued that their grasp on handhelds are going down as the market shifts towards mobile.

We already know the Wii U was a crash and burn.

It truly is remarkable that you stand here in reality and knowingly spout off such false bullshit. "
109792,"Agreed. There is nothing special about this. Only difference I see is that I will be asked to pay for my shitty online experience now.

122533,Sounds like one of those alternative facts.
