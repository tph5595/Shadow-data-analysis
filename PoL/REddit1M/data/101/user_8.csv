6243,"Ocarina and Majora were N64 games ported at a later date. Wind waker and twilight, GC games ported. The variety of game boy and game boy advance, ported. NES and SNES titles, ported. There is not a Zelda game that will be on the Wii U first and ported at a later date so his point stands. "
7434,Not really. BotW is launching on the 3rd on both wii u and switch. It was not on the wii u first.
8165,"Yeah. It's definitely strange, I sold my wii u when I realized that we were unlikely to see a Zelda title on the console for at least a couple years, if at all. Glad I did, I'd much rather play it on the switch. "
9350,"Agreed, it began development as a wii u game. But it's obvious that when Nintendo saw the opportunity to use it as a launch title for the switch,  it became a switch game. It's very similar to TP and the GameCube and wii. TP started development as a GameCube game. Was moved to the wii. The difference is, the GameCube had WW as its exclusive Zelda. The wii u never had it's own Zelda title. "
9511,"Removed the second half, you're right "
10956,Exclusives is definitely the wrong word yeah. Timed exclusives would be much more accurate. Would you agree there? Every other Nintendo console has had a timed exclusive Zelda game before it was ported or remastered to another console. Wii U will be the first Nintendo console that does not have a Zelda that is only available on it for a period of time. 
11796,"I don't think anyone is getting their pitchforks out. No one, aside from people that maybe bought a Wii u because they wanted the Zelda title for it, is really upset. It's just an interesting point. Aside from the virtual boy, which was a massive critical and commercial failure, every Nintendo console has had at least one Zelda title made solely for it until said titles were ported and remastered. It's an interesting note in the ongoing history of Nintendo consoles, especially as many consider the Wii U to be a major misstep on Nintendos part. 

Now as for the semantics of the wii u people being able to play it a few minutes sooner because they don't have to unbox a console, that's a little silly. The point still stands that it comes out on the same day worldwide for the Wii U and Switch. And as far as MK8 goes, that's exactly what I meant by timed exclusive and ports. It is a Wii U game that came out a few years ago that's now moving on to the Switch. This is not the case for Zelda. "
11903,"I'd be interested in seeing how a port of any 3DS title would work, as many use the lower screen for menus and maps at the very least. That being said, it's possible and there are some games I would love to see make the leap to switch. "
13030,"The title is still accurate, I was just trying to level with you on what we were talking about. I'm sorry other people's opinions on the state of the Wii U and BotW upset you. "
13928,But at this point you're just arguing the wording of his title. None of that changes the fact that the Wii u will be the first Nintendo console ever to share it's only Zelda titles release date with another console. 
14285,What is the other console?
18365,He's grasping at straws and being argumentative now man. He's just not willing to concede the point. Time to leave it lol. 
22051,I got what you were saying and totally agree. I'm not sure why the yoshi dude took it as such a personal mission to defend the WiiU. He's either hugely invested in the WiiU or he just likes arguing.
33337,Yeah games that just have it for items and maps would definitely be a lot easier to port.
