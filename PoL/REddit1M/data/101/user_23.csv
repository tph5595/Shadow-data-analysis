They're very similar sure but I only consider something the same generation if they can both play the same games entirely. Since GBC can't be played on a GB then it's another generation. But I disagree with your sentiment, because it's another platform specifically designed for color and such is the game. I don't think the directors cuts of games are new titles either unless it changes the game entirely or adds almost twice the content."

347253,Ah.. Well I still mostly agree then. This is where I was gonna make an argument for LA and LADX but upon doing research they came out like.. 5 years apart. So I will say they were console exclusive. Now had it been like.. Less than 2 years my mind wouldn't have been changed.
