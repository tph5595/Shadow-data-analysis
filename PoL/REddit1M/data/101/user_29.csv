It will probably run at 30fps and not support mods at all.  And then you have the decision for paid online services, the voice chat for which requires you to use your own cell phone.

I think the Switch will be another huge flop, only worth picking up in a few years after some price drops and 5 or 6 good first party releases."

The Switch looks so bad it made me just go out and buy a Wii U so I can play BotW.  It should actually get here tomorrow.  I'll get the HD Zelda remakes, Mario Maker for my son, and possibly Mario Kart and DKC: TF."
