30795,"personally i haven't seen any changes from how nintendo is doing things that will change the outcome between the Wii U and the switch

so let me list my concerns...

star fox zero is a case study on using the 2 screen feature of the Wii U and it was a [colossal failure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m544qfVMIPs), it demonstrated to the world that nintendo released a console with a gimmick, that they themselves could not figure out how to use and may have killed star fox as a franchise, how could any other developer make a game for the Wii U if nintendo didn't even no how?

that brings us to the joycon gimmick of the switch, sure it can be safely ignored, but there is money put into those joycons and it would be a real shame if they only utilized in a game like ""ARMS"" instead of a real AAA nintendo title, a game that needs those controls and by itself can sell units

as others have echoed, launch titles and titles announced for the switch are unimpressive, for the Wii U we had smash brothers with the promise of a zelda game, this time we have zelda...and few other AAA nintendo (smash, metroid, star fox, etc) titles announced sans the new mario game, its eerily similar to what happened to the Wii U

Nintendo's online services have been subpar for the longest time, not even having user accounts meaning that your online retro game purcheses are tied to the console requiring much hassle to presumably be able to transfer games to the switch, and lag at least used to be a huge problem in nintendo games online and was less of a problem with the Wii U but it still leaves me not wanting to play smash 4 online when i could be playing other online games lag free, and now they ask us to pay for a subscription service in order to play online mulltiplayer?

and finally 3rd party support, we were told we would get it with the Wii U but that did not happen, this time we do have bethesda releasing a 6 year old game on nintendo's new console, impressive. but how can we expect 3rd party developers that want to release their games on multiple systems to make a port for the switch if the switch version of the game will look noticeably worse than on the other consoles? and to this day with nintendo's bad reputation with 3rd party titles can a company take the risk of making a AAA game exclusively for the switch?

i don't want to bet against the switch, i want nintendo to succeed because i want to play good smash/zelda/metroid/star fox games again, but there are problems here that i don't think good marketing can fix"
