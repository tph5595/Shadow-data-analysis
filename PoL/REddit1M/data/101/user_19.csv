If the Switch didn't have an online infrastructure, you'd complain, and now that it does, you're still complaining because you haven't seen it yet. "

&gt; You are just wrong in every possible way.

Actually, I was just wrong about one thing. I'm still completely correct about the fact that you're fucking whiny. It's a good thing nobody is forcing you to buy a Switch, and an even better thing that BotW is coming to the WiiU. "

The Wii sold more than the PS3 and Xbox 360 by *far*, and the 3DS absolutely dominated the handheld market and continues to do so. It's honestly so sad that you have the entire internet available to you and can look up anything you want but you continue to spew out bullshit. I know you don't like to think, but it's a straight up fact that Nintendo has been very successful despite being ""isolated from the industry"" it's in part due to the fact that most of Nintendo's first party games are phenomenal."
