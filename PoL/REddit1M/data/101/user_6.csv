4902,"I see this a lot, but with all the remakes, that's not true at all anymore.

Ocarina is playable on many consoles, and Majora almost equally so. Therefore there are no Zelda titles exclusive to the N64. The same with Wind Waker, and Twilight Princess, and most if not all the early games too. 

Actually, I don't think there are *any* Zelda titles exclusive to one console. "
6974,"By the same logic, BotW is a Wii U game ported to the Switch at launch. There's no difference. "
9017,"How can you say that when it was specifically developed starting for the Wii U? And functionally, what difference does it make if it's ported immediately at launch or a few months later? It's the same game.

Does that mean Minecraft is exclusive to PC? That's where it came out first. What about Mario Kart 8? And don't forget Tetris - that beloved Elektronica 60 exclusive. "
9570,"Functionally what difference does it make? Read my edit above for other classic ""exclusives.""

My point is this whole argument is stupid, because you can play TP on GameCube, Wii, and Wii U and WW on both GCN and Wii U. There are no exclusives here. "
10097,"Yep you're definitely right on TFH and ALBW, and I'm pretty sure FSA hasn't been released on VC, correct? So it seems there are a couple of exclusives, but nowhere near what some people claim. "
11165,"Sure. Unless you want to get into the semantics that it will undoubtedly be possible to play on the Wii U than it will be on the Switch - the latter requires setting up the console and everything. *Especially* if they allow pre-loading the downloadable version.

(And as others have pointed out, the Wii U won't be the first Nintendo console). 

In any case, what does it matter if it doesn't have a timed 'exclusive'? Should we get our pitchforks because MK8 will no longer be a Wii U exclusive now either?"
12875,"You're forgetting that DSi doesn't have any exclusive Zelda games. New 3DS doesn't either. 

&gt;Exlcusives is definitely the wrong word yeah. 

&gt;No one, aside from people that maybe bought a Wii u because they wanted the Zelda title for it, is really upset. It's just an interesting point. 

Glad we can agree that the title post is not only wrong, but even when adapted is also completely inconsequential. "
13121,The title is not accurate. You agreed with me that they are not exclusives. 
13751,"And yet they have their own exclusive titles. However, a Zelda title is not among them. So why shouldn't they count?

I completely understand your thinking - it isn't hard to get. That doesn't stop it from being factually wrong. "
14146,"1. It's not the only console.

2. I'm rejecting both the premise and the importance. It's a trite description of focus and demonstrably and factually false to say that other Zelda titles are exclusives. "
14319,"Listed above, Virtual Boy, DSi, and New 3DS. "
14741,"They're not the own consoles? Then how come they have games not playable on the DS and 3DS? Notice I'm not making a fuss about the 2DS or the various sizes of the DS/3DS - I'm only talking explicitly about consoles with separate groups of games. DSi and N3DS are two such systems.

And I'm sorry you thinking a console isn't relevant means it doesn't count. If I dislike the Wii U, does that mean I can say that BotW is a Switch exclusive?"
17807,"Why do they not count? That's not what the word ""exclusive"" means. If you want to say ""timed exclusive"" by all means, but those are different things. Just like Minecraft isn't a PC exclusive and how Tetris isn't ""exclusively"" for the Electronika 60. "
24619,"What do you mean ""retroactively take it away""? Simple question: is Minecraft a PC exclusive or not? If not, then by the same token you cannot say that other Nintendo consoles have exclusive Zelda titles. "
25832,"Okay, cool, so we agree there are currently no consoles that have an exclusive Zelda game - outside of I guess 3DS with ALBW and TFH. "
26147,"How was it not? The post is that the Wii U is the first (coincidentally, also not true) Nintendo console without an exclusive Zelda. You just agreed with me that that isn't true. "
27081,"Again, not every console, but I understand what you're trying to say. The post is still factually wrong, but I commend you on actually defending your argument better than anyone else I've seen. "
