But the core appeal of Nintendo is in the Switch now and that's where all the focus is. I say we all move on and forgive the stumble since I think Nintendo has learned from their mistakes with the Wii U - primarily in marketing - thus leading to sales - thus leading to better continued support!"

What gimmicks are speaking of? Mobility? One of the driving forces in the modern tech world? How is being able to play my full 3D-HD Zelda games on my way to work/on breaks/in my bed a gimmick? They also have quite a lot more developer support than the Wii U had by a large margin. They also have central support around traditional controls that does not isolate developers. Most games, even games like Arms that features a motion ""gimmick"" can be used with a just basic controls.

Every console known to man launches with a weak library, are you serious? The Xbone had a god-awful launch year, same with PS4 and they both piggy-backed off legacy titles, same as Nintendo. 

What basic features are we missing out on? And why is the assumption that what gamers expect in a console is what gamers want? This idea of modern fanservice is so prohibiting for innovation it makes me laugh. Only the Western world circlejerks about technical power as the only progression of technical innovation. I do not give a shit about 60FPS or what resolution my game is. If it looks good and plays good and is intelligently designed - I am A-okay. In fact, centering games around needing to look as realistic as possible further informs users of the divide between reality and games and then leads to people caring so much about immersion and a bunch of nonsense that boils down to simulation. I don't want to play a simulation, I want to play a game. There is value in hyper-realism, high frames, good graphics and simulation-like immersion HOWEVER it is not all that matters.

In what ways have other consoles innovated? All they've done is smooth out the core experience, but that means that the only way consoles improve is with hard power and at that point, why not just get a decent PC? Sure, there will still be merit in the Xbone and PS4, and that's why I chose to buy those as well - but ultimately, what we are left ""expecting"" from consoles and games are things that never mattered to me when I learned to love video games as a child. Nothing tops good art and design. And if I can have that, and the comfort of traditional controls and HD graphics but take it anywhere I want...I sure as hell will accept my ""underpowered"" console. 

So. Tell me again why gamer expectations matter? Did they matter when the Wii was the best selling console of its generation? No. What matters is if something sells enough for shareholders and developers to continue investing - and the Wii U didn't. But the mistake wasn't the gimmick. It was the marketing. The common person STILL to this day does not know what the Wii U is. Gamers, like myself and so many others, barely knew what the Wii U was on launch, it got such little support in marketing even despite its name that people that were in the gaming scene didn't know what Nintendo was selling.

That is the very basis of how the Wii U means nothing next to the Switch. To summarize:

- Portability and mobility matter a LOT more than Reddit realizes and is something that is known to sell

- Switch has much more developer support across the board AND has some of the biggest Nintendo heavy hitters in years -&gt; BoTW, Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 2

All three of those mean more to the console than any game meant to the Wii U. Splatoon crafted a niche for the Wii U and was the only reason I bought mine. Zelda hasn't had a non-motion control 3D experience in almost ten years, and it's been 6 years since Skyward Sword. Mario Odyssey is the spiritual successor to Mario 64 and the last BIG Mario 3D game was Galaxy 1 and 2, which were huge sellers for the Wii. 

- Control schemes isolated developers far more than graphical capabilities did and Nintendo is ensuring that no matter what, games will support traditional control schemes. 

- The marketing for the Switch has been superb. The release trailer was seen by everyone I know. They had a very clear marketing approach and everyone knows this is something new/different from Nintendo. It isn't a Wii, it isn't just an add-on or remake. It's a new console that will give you the Nintendo games you've always wanted, wherever you go. That will sell like hot cakes. Not to mention it is the cheapest release price of a console in years.

31597,"I'm confused about this criticism of the joycons. They are simply a dynamic remastering of traditional controllers tailored to the systems need to engage portability and multiplayer. Where's the gimmick? Haptic feedback? Hardly something to tailor anything around. 

The number of 3rd party developers that are lined up for unannounced content is far beyond what the Wii u had on release as well though. Plus they seem to be encouraging small developers to develop and make it easy for them. So more indie like titles. "
