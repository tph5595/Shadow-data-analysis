2035239," Hi, all! /r/SubredditDrama ambassador here, hoping to clarify a few things to those of you who may be confused:


SubredditDrama (SRD) is a \/r/bestof style subreddit that aggregates drama from all over reddit. We aim to not participate in the drama we link to, but if you would like to discuss any of the drama you are free to do so in our subreddit. If you choose to do so, please read the guidelines in the sidebar before contributing. We like to watch drama, not start it.


If you have any complaints about Slytherbot2 please PM /u/AlyoshaV, Slytherbot2's proprietor. I am sure he would love to hear your comments.


This bot is maintained by the SubredditDrama mods. [You can get in touch with us here.](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSubredditDrama&amp;subject=RE:%20subredditdrama%20bot)"
