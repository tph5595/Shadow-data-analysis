27095,"I know you're just trying to be an asshole, but I'm not going to waste my time with it. I have far more important things to do than be validated by some stranger on the Internet. 

I've done grid work from a picture, and I wish those were actually that instead of just painting over. Because that's not just adding colors to an already existing picture. "
35325," I really don't care about stupid Internet points. OP is whining and bitching about upvotes i really don't care about. All it takes is some common sense. And no, it doesn't take a second and I never did say that. I said it takes no skill. Because it doesn't take any skill. It takes time. 

Even fucking photoshop takes no skill. Want to impress me, do that traditionally. I will criticize whatever the fuck I want, but I'm not going to take my time to do some bullshit thing that you will never actually be happy about. Want me to stop criticizing? Get off the Internet. Please and thank you. :) "

It's so funny how the hive mind works on reddit. It actually makes me laugh. Fucking people on the Internet. "
