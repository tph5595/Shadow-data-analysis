15725,"The problem is that as an artist, we take a lot of time in coming up with original compositions and take even more time in painting/drawing them. 

For someone to so easily claim them as their own, without saying it's not his originally prior to, it really sucks. I learned how to draw by tracing or copying to get proportions right, but I *always* credited the artist. That was 10 years ago and now that I make my own work, I'd be really irritated with someone saying it was their own. It's just courtesy. 

EDIT: A little more explanation. At the time I viewed both the artists' work and the OP's post, I was on my phone. I'd remembered seeing the Deku Link picture and thinking it looked like a filtered photoshop, and seeing Skull Kid on my phone, it looked the same. However, after getting on a desktop computer, I can (obviously) tell that it is an artistic rendition and while compositionally, a copy, it is different. Not vastly different, but different. I've written an apology to the artist as well, but that doesn't change my stance on credit. If you trace, say so. If you just eye-ball copy it, say so. Don't be ashamed either, because it's not a big deal to say it outright."
29279,But there's a difference between fan art and outright exact copying when you claim it's your own. 
29376,"I wouldn't go that far, because they're exact copies so it'd be copyright infringement. "
32423,"I politely disagree. I didn't know about the OP vs the guy drawing, so from OP's post, it seemed that the artist didn't say he'd traced it until he was called out on it. It's just a pretty crappy thing to do, to wait until someone notices before giving credit. 

And I say ""as an artist"" because I see it all the time. Yes, it's clearly from the game, but the guy in question didn't do anything to make it his own. He basically copied it exactly minus making it a little blurry. So all I'm saying is make it clear from the start that it's not your own work. I'm no saying I'm an authority figure, but that as someone who specifically studies art, that guy crossed a line by initially saying it was his own.  "
33536,"You keep saying lynching as if I freaked out. I was just explaining from my perspective how I interpreted OP's post and the situation. 

And so you know, I neither upvoted or downvoted this post or the artist in question.   I'm not trying to argue either way. "
36487,"I definitely agree. Mimicry is one of the best ways to learn proportion and to develop a style. And I think it's a great drawing, but from what I understood, there was a miscommunication in whether or not it was his work to claim. I just first saw the comparisons on my phone app, and they look extremely similar.

40673,"It's okay, I didn't say you did. Just that the artist (you) wouldn't be able to."
41544,"Okay, I am home now and logged into my computer to see the images better. They are very much their own style. 

From my tiny phone, they looked like somebody took the screencaps and filtered them/blurred everything out. And I think he does have amazing talent, because I couldn't do anything like that on a computer. I hope that all this drama doesn't dissuade him in making more, because I know how disheartening it can be to get awful comments, even if it's from strangers. I'm personally messaging him to let him know my opinion (not that it should matter) but I hope I can encourage him. :("
41610,"Listen, I was going to write a response but I don't think you deserve the time."
42636,Except that [he said it was traced?](http://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/t2l9r/i_made_another_drawing_for_you_guys_skull_kid/c4j4tfl?context=3)
43351,Okay. So he used the original as a base... traced over it to create his drawing... and you still think it's not tracing?
