28639,"Making a painting from a photograph is perfectly legitimate. It's not like he took the images straight up. They are original content, they're his paintings. 

Quit yer bitchin. "
28808,"It would be perfectly legitimate to sell these for money. He painted them, it doesn't matter if the subject of the painting was a photograph."
28869,"It is an original piece. He made a painting, the rest is irrelevant. "
29033,"This is like someone painting a picture of a car, and calling them dishonest when they fail to fess up that they didn't design the car. "
37408,It's not an exact copy. It's a painting. 
38064,"They are VERY OBVIOUSLY screenshots from the opening scenes in Majora's mask. It's like painting over a screenshot of darth vader choking a dude. No shit it's a screenshot, everyone and their dog have seen the footage it's from. I seriously doubt he was actually trying to fool people on this one, he'd be an idiot to try. "
38143,"This, but instead of being too lazy I just didn't give any fucks. So up vote I did. "
38282,"I was very upset about that actually, so I went by and up voted all the compliments, including yours. 

Downvoting for percieved Karma whoring is one thing, but don't down vote the people who actually liked the post just because you didn't. 

Talk about ultimate butthurt. "
38347,How could you NOT. It's not as if you could actually skip the opening scene of major's mask. 
38452,"The problem with your argument is that this is /r/zelda, not an art gallery. The guy was bored at work and traced over these screenshots on his drawing tablet. It took him 45 minutes. 

He probably figured he wouldn't have to point out that they were screenshots because, well, it's pretty fucking obvious isn't it? "
38660,"So basically you're butthurt because people like his artwork. 

How dare us philistines not like your artwork as much. "
41628,"Treating it as an art gallery doesn't mean getting butthurt in art gallery type ways. You may treat it as an art gallery all you like, but the rules of an art gallery do not apply. "
41806,"Exactly, It's all fair game. There's no reason to get butthurt about one 45 minute fan art project but not the next. "
