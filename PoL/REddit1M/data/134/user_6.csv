I'm really sick of comments like these trying to say ""I was ripped off omg"" you can even get your upvote back, simply by clicking.

I'm still upvoting however beacuse, even though he might have traced it, it still looks good and I enjoy it.

I fucking bet you wouldn't have any trouble upvoting some ""enchanted"" picture showing new graphical viewpoint on the game, but when he is being honest he is a bad guy.
