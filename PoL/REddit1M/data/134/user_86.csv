36286,Those traces are really good though. They have a style not present in the screenshots they are based off of. I also don't see the problem. Maybe now that the OP of those screens has drawn the characters once he can move on to something original.

All the jaggies gone all the texture grain nowhere to be found. If he just traced it he clearly used great creativity and his own artistic style in the recreation. Which is karma worthy in my opinion. Again, I just hope the artist used the practice to make something original. Because what he's done thusfar looks very good."
