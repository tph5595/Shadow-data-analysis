21097,"The important part of this being ""the artist."" No, he cannot give credit by saying ""Hey look its Zelda"" -_-"
21523,I like how you completely avoided the point that was made
74425,"developers, artists, whoever you believe deserves the credit. Even something as vague as ""the guys over at nintendo"" would have done. The fact that he was treating the work as his own (by not giving any credit to anyone at all) is just wrong.

That's just my opinion. I'm no artist, but I believe that some kind of credit, or at least honesty that it was a screencap, is missing here."
276771,"You have a good point, and believe me I've thought this through long and hard. Its just that if you're getting popular off of somebody else's work (even on reddit), you really have to give credit. That statement is even more true when it comes to artists and their work.

If this guy had drawn a picture and shown a couple friends and that was it, obviously he doesn't have to give credit. But with the popularity that his drawing has gained, you could probably find his work by searching for ""majora's mask"" on google images. Yes, we know where the original screenshot came from, but that's not the point. Its about giving a slight nod to the guys who worked so hard on their game that it gives us fans nerdgasms every time we think about it.

I think people are going a little bit too far though. The guy obviously made revisions to titles and giving credit and whatnot, so we should all probably just drop it at this point."
395892,Yeah that's true. Hadn't really thought about it that way. And yeah I should probably finish that too o.O
