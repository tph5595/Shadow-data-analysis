14337,"I don't see any problem, and I think his ""traces"" are awesome and are worth getting some recognition. It'd be the same as not giving a ""cover song"" or all the other Zelda artwork that's posted on this subreddit any recognition. They're all copies, but I guess some people deem his artwork/effort less, just because they were actually ""traced"" opposed to re-created from looking at the same artwork... 

Edit: Also, reminded me of [This](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMwhZryRUr4) when I read the OP"
