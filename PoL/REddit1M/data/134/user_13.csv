14037,"Not having played Majora's Mask (I know, blasphemy), I didn't know these were trace-overs. As an artist, I find that incredibly lazy, especially given the quality of the work. When you create art using existing source material, one of the challenges faced is creativity with the subject, both for the quality of the work and so that you don't face litigation. Simply put, the picture looks bad and the artist should feel bad. For multiple reasons."
17207,"I see a lot of people downvoting and disagreeing with the OP. I know the original artist is not selling his works, and even admitted to how they were traceovers, but his admission was only after being called out. From an artist's standpoint, this is dishonest and comes off as lying by omission. Some of you may not be artists, and as such you don't know how crummy it is to create an original piece, not get any recognition for it (since that is largely what any freelance artist is looking for, aside from pay)...then have a guy sloppily trace over images and get attention for it. So downvote away. But please see where some of us are coming from."
23605,"My apologies for not being clear, I was on my way out when writing that response. I wasn't trying to infer that I thought he was taking from freelance images. I'm saying that as a freelance artist, one of the challenges faced when making fan art, is taking the subject matter and doing something that is both creative, well-composed and executed well. If these were not traceovers, then I think it would fit the criteria, but it's not. I see it as an integrity issue. The artist could have, from the get go, mentioned that they were just trace overs, but only did so when someone called him out on it."
23830,"Where did I ever imply that he owned Skull Kid or Deku Link? Here's my argument, clarified:

As an artist making fan art, a challenge for an honest artist is in taking the subject (link, for example) and doing something that is both creative, well-composed and executed well. Even then that's not a guarantee that you'll get a lot of exposure. When you have someone come in who makes fan art that takes creative screenshots that are well composed, and executes it in an *okay* manner, to see them get that much recognition, it's annoying."

I assume you mean 'plagiarism', and like I mentioned earlier, I feel it's lying by omission to those not in the know. Tell me, have you played Majora's Mask? I haven't, so I wasn't aware that these could have been traceovers, until it was brought up. "
30160,It is a minor issue but hey...it's a slow day :)
39517,"I don't know whether to be insulted, or sad for what passes as likeable artwork around here, then."
40269,"since you seem to have replied to several of my comments, let me answer you back: no, it wasn't that obvious. I've stated that since I haven't played Majora's Mask, I personally didn't recognize them as screenshots. I imagine that for those of us who haven't played Majora's Mask, they might not recognize it as traced over screenshots either.

Many people treat /r/zelda as an art gallery because hey, it will receive a decent amount of recognition by Zelda fans when submitted in here. "
