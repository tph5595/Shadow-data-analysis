29880,"What do you mean, ""admission""? He needs to admit that it's an obvious trace of a famous scene from a famous game that most everyone in this subreddit knows well and has played?  You're telling me that must be admitted?

How about we preface every single post in this subreddit with ""Disclaimer: I admit that what you're about to see borrows from the story of a game made by Nintendo as part of the Legend of Zelda franchise."""
