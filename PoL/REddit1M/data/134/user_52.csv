He traced a screenshot from the game. It's not like he stole someone else's art and posted it here (which a lot of people do, but I don't see you freaking out about that)."
23726,"Yeah, but his 'art' in question was a screencap from the game. How can you credit that? List the developers?"
23956,Well that was awful. Just plain awful.
24117,"Most of us here have played Majora's Mask, and knew that they were tracings (or at least, you know, exact replicas). We upvoted them because they were cool renditions of an awesome scene in an amazing game.

I'm an artist too, and I couldn't give less fucks over this situation. He posted pictures he traced to a website so that people could enjoy them. It wouldn't have been any different if he had posted the ACTUAL screen shots, which a lot of people actually do around here."
118899,"Well I was on the other thread first, the one for the picture that he posted, and he said it was a screen cap. Hell, he even said he traced it. I don't know if that was before or after you called him out, but he openly admitted it.

What's more, is that he wasn't REALLy withholding information. We knew from the start that it was from Majora's Mask, and the moment we saw the actual picture we knew it was a copy of an exact scene, and a memorable one to say the least.

Honestly, if you're gonna freak out about this particular incident, I think you should freak out about most things on r/zelda. What with the drawings, videos, comics, and tattoos...would you not say that those are all plagiarisms, if you would qualify this as one?

Just something to think about."
299736,"Amen to that.

I have one more thing to add, though: posting a picture on r/zelda, in my opinion, is giving a nod to the developers right there. The guy could have posted it on r/pics, or something else, with the title ""Look at this Zelda drawing I made!""

The fact that he came to us, our subreddit, to share it with fellow fans, is enough for me to let it go. Besides, they looked cool as tits.

But yes, I stick by that code as well my man: give credit where credit is due. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna go beat Skyward Sword (finally)."
