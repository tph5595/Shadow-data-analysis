15790,Exactly. He only admitted to tracing after someone says something about it. I could actually see polygons in the Skull Kid one. To present something like an original piece when it's not is plagiarizing.
15822,All it takes is a droppler tool to get the *exact* hue.
15986,Probably why it's not that big of a resolution either.
16691,"I spent two years replicating Picasso paintings, and despite the simple shapes, they were extremely hard to get the correct color and shading; being colorblind, I also had to enlist help in mixing. I was working with acrylic however, and there is no easy tool to copy color in real life like in digital painting.

The biggest problem here though is that it was presented as original work until he was called out on it, it wasn't told originally that he traced it. That's not even just trying to recreate the image from scratch either. There's not even a hint of his own creativity in the images to separate them from the originals, especially when I can see the grass polygons in the blurred out background of the Skull Kid one."

34976,"Looking at the comments under the posts under discussion is what made me look at the OP's griping here; as the OP said, the guy didn't make any mention of copying right over a copyrighted image until the OP brought it up. I agree it leaves a bad taste in the mouth as it devalues the work at hand; it's not a replication (as many, me included, had originally thought) or an original concept."
35659,"I don't think you understand what I and others have said. I read the comments for the images, and that's what piqued my interest here. The guy didn't state they were trace drawings until the OP pointed it out, which had made people feel like due to the omission that the images were present as something of original conception, hence plagiarism. It was not explicitly stated, but implied. Creating fan art alone isn't plagiarism, as as not everything is a traced copy; to create fan art is to come up with something of original composition based on something else.

In any case, I don't need a definition for the word ""made"", and it may just be text over the internet, but I don't like your tone. So fuck you, sir. Have a nice day. I'm done talking to you."
