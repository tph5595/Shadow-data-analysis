The OP keeps acting like a fucking moron throwing around the word plagiarism. This isn't DeviantArt. He's not required to make a detailed description about everything he did to create the image attributing all sources. This is fucking reddit, a link aggregator. If you like something, upvote it. If you don't, downvote it and move on with your fucking life.
