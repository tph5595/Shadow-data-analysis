While the pics aren't 100% original, the artist still put effort and creativity into the final product.

Also, if you really want to argue that this is inappropriate, then go downvote all the other Zelda doodles people post. Most of them are copies of official artwork anyway, but no one rages over those because they typically aren't drawn well anyway."
