Even if I have more strengh in the left arm, I always assumed accuracy would be more important than power. So honestly I really think people are overreacting this thing"
34188,"While I don´t think they will allow further customization, I always saw link as an empty and void character that allows the player to to merge with him and live his adventures as his own. That always seemed their intention throughout all games. He doesnt speak, he rarely has a personality (wind waker seems to be an exception), etc. All that is built through your actions during the game. That makes Link sort of a customizable character, at least on the inside. 

But breaking the 25 year old tradition of changing the main character's gender, i don't see that happening. I think that there is even lore that mentions there will always be a boy hero+princess+villain reincarnation. Hopeffully someone more knowledgeable than me can clarify, since I have'nt played TP and SS yet."
