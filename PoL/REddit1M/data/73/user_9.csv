I don't think it's New Hyrule and thus not in the Wind Waker timeline.  Tech reminds me of some of the ancient-futuristic stuff in Skyward Sword.  Maybe his Ganondorf-like armguards hint at some origin of the Gerudo."

I'm surprised the speculation isn't more centered around Link already being skilled before he becomes the hero he is destined to be."
