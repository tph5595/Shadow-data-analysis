23694,"Wow at the downvotes....He is left handed in most of the games. Except for twilight princess for wii and its optional in skyward sword. This is so that the majority of the wold, right handed, can play with the motion controlles.Edit: You could still say that he is left handed in twilight princess, since the game is mirrored on the wii.
