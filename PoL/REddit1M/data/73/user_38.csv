35159,"&gt; You can already change the name of the character you play away from Link

You've been able to do that since the first game"
35468,"Exactly. You want to play as a girl in a Nintendo game? There are plenty of other options. The first ones that come to mind are any Pokemon game newer than gen. II, Animal Crossing, and Metroid. You don't see people wanting to have a girl as the main character in a Mario game (sure, there was Super Princess Peach, and she was playable in Super Mario Bros. 2, but that's it)"
35547,"You're thinking of Wind Waker and Twilight Princess right? Maybe Skyward Sword as well, but I haven't played that one yet"
35811,"I hope they don't. They should have it play like Wind Waker HD, using the gamepad (and it would make much more sense to do this in my opinion)"
36049,Everything is after Skyward Sword... The timeline branches after Ocarina of Time
73087,Nice. It just makes more sense that they would use the gamepad. Why require a controller that the person buying the game might not even have?
