Personally i am OK with the Blue shirt, because 1) it's official  2) Link had a blue shirt in Windwaker and he got a green tunic later 3) Link had THREE tunic colors in both OoT and TP.

I see no reason to be upset, if anything we should be more excited at the prospect of having more items to fiddle with.

If i had to take a guess, they showed Link like that in the trailer to create buzz, but to also keep peoples imaginations running. Because i have a feeling they don't want to ruin the reveal of Link turning into our Hero, green tunic and all."
