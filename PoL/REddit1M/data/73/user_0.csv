0,
2533,people complained like he isn't link because the shirt (in the original) wasn't green and lead to rumors that it was someone else.
3285,made the Shirt green. since link uses green.
32352,I think it's after Skyward sword for two reasons. Link is not left handed like in Skyward sword. yes i believe some where in the timeline that will shift and second is the enemy in the trailer. It has the same aesthetic look to the Ancient Robots in Skyward Sword. 
34265,"The only thing I have against picking boy or girl. Is people think if you pick girl, Zelda is male. Which pretty goes against the whole thing because the first Zelda is the Goddess Hylia turned... let's say for the best phrasing Hylian. They all havethe Goddess in their blood. Further more at the game of Minish Cap talks about the Light Force which is passed down from Princess to Princess."
37870,He looks like Link to me.
38041,Sorry I didn't place the coma to make it clear. I mean gender choice for Link because some see female Link so male Zelda.

46260,Please Understand [Iwata hand movement intensifies]
46402,Also that he the only one that can kick ass in the whole kingdom.
46633,Now you say that. It reminded me of the bad ass blue gear in TP.
46659,The Blue TP one is awesome.
70433,It's the sacrifice to look good.
70463,All Zelda's had you change your outfit according to area. All hd ways to upgrade certain things. Espeically the Skyward sword. Why would you need classes when Link can do it all.
79691,Because of the Spirit of the Hero that dwells with in. 
80852,That would be badass and it would be the only Link not in his teen years.
