9290,I normally don't agree with most things you say but how the fuck is this downvoted?  Are people really convinced that Link can't change his clothes?  Have they forgotten that Link hasn't worn his classic outfit in the beginning of *any* of the 3D games since Wind Waker?
9394,"It really means nothing.  They can have him wear whatever they like in whatever trailer.  Just because they showed off his traditional outfit in others doesn't mean they have to show it off this time.

They're trying to do things differently, and shake it up, but I guarantee you that you *will* get the classic garb.  Not only is it tradition, and therefore expected, but it's part of the lore."
55885,"I said 3D, mate. :p

I mean technically it *is* 3D, but it's still a top-down game."
55949,We just disagree a lot lol.
71412,"You seem *really* butthurt about somebody being left handed...

Why does it upset you?  Are you prejudice against lefties because you're a righty? lol"
71485,"&gt;motion controls in this game using the wiimote/nunchuck setup.

It's confirmed to use the gamepad, not motion controls."
71589,It's confirmed to play exactly how you hope it does.  I don't understand how all these people know so much about Zelda yet missed the multiple interviews where they talk about how it uses the Wii U gamepad.
75628,"Well, alright, I'll give you the source after I say this: Do you really think Nintendo is going to neglect using their latest feature (the gamepad/touchscreen) in the series that *always* make the most use of said features?  You believe they're gonna sell a game that *doesn't* work with the console's controller - the console's primary feature?  And instead force people to buy old hardware from the last gen?  It would be nonsense.  Nintendo always make the most use of their latest technology.

Anyway, source:

&gt;4Gamer: How is the new Wii U title coming along?

&gt;Eiji Aonuma: Of course it's moving along. We also have to reflect on what we did with Wind Waker for our next title. Since Wind Waker HD was a remake, there were limits to what we could do with the Wii U GamePad, **but for a new title, we can utilize it to the fullest.**

&gt;4Gamer: So people who have played Wind Waker HD can expect some of those elements to carry over onto the next game.

&gt;Eiji Aonuma: I believe so. For example, on the Wii U GamePad, you have a map display on the screen. This map isn't just for the sea, it's also for other locations as well. We will reflect on these sort of things for a new game. 

from the interview here: http://www.zeldainformer.com/news/eiji-aonuma-interview-part-3-zelda-u-future-of-remakes-and-more#.U5jEAyjff51

There was also an interview that said the Wii U gamepad was designed with Zelda U in mind, but I cannot find it."
75782,"Exactly.  I've tried to explain this to so many people... but they choose to pretend it isn't a factor.

Nintendo also isn't gonna neglect their latest feature, especially in a game that *always* takes advantage of things like that.  They even said the Wii U gamepad was designed with Zelda U in mind."
129303,"I wasn't being a jerk lol... or trying to.  I was merely making a point.  Those were the only words I could find to make said point.  I wasn't trying to offend you.

How would you have said it?"
130535,"I wanted to make the point of what seemed obvious to me.  Surely Nintendo wouldn't release a game that doesn't work with the console's own controller, that controller being the console's primary point.  Ya know?"
131422,"Well sorry if I jumped the gun there, but you made it very clear that you wouldn't believe it without source, and I was merely giving my reasoning as to why it should almost go without saying.

It's possible that you'll be able to use the Wiimote and Nunchuck as an option, but it would probably be handled akin to Twilight Princess if it is implemented, rather than Skyward Sword which was build ground-up to work with 1:1 motion controls.

That said, we don't even know what hand Link actually uses.  The hand you use to shoot doesn't necessarily have to be your dominant hand.  As many have pointed it, it mostly comes down to your dominant eye, and some people are simply more comfortable shooting the other way.  I'm not an archer or anything, but I have used bows before, and while I'm right handed, I shoot 'lefty'.  It just feels much more natural to me.

All in all I think people are trying to squeeze way more information out of a trailer which simply doesn't contain all that much."
134107,"The shoulder-strap is a much better indicator of which hand Link uses, yes.  What I *think* is going happen is that the primary gameplay mode will be the Gamepad itself, and you'll have the option to use motion controls akin to Twilight Princess, if you so desire.  That would explain Link's apparent right-handedness.  It's kind of like taking the concepts behind TP on Gamecube and TP on Wii and putting them in one game, and simply giving you the option of which to use. This time, not having to worry about mirroring anything if Link truly is right-handed from the get-go.

They might even include the 1:1 sword controls, but I feel like they're going to try to find a way to have each mode balanced evenly.  Maybe to compensate, they'll add more depth to the Gamepad controls.  Merely speculation, though."
