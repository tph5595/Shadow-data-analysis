He is already a skilled fighter with high-tech equipment, which usually does not happen until later in the game, yet he is wearing clothing which is traditionally only worn at the very beginning of the game.  Since this is just a trailer, not gameplay, it doesn't mean much, but it is still an odd choice."

91124,But why would he be wearing a zora tunic while on horseback on solid land?  And why would they choose that outfit for him to wear for the trailer?
