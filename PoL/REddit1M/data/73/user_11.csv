One with the game pad, one with the wii and nunchuck, and the other with the pro controller maybe?

Seriously how cool is that thing!"

Basically flip the model?

Well I guess that wouldn't work entirely in some cut scenes and like."
14718,"Yep, thats what I thought. Although its a little bit of a lore bummer, who cares? It shouldn't matter what hand someone uses. Link is still the hero of time/wind/seasons/ages/ocean/ what ever he's into."
23741,Well we did see hyrule field from ocarina of time. And this is probably post Twilight princess. Maybe he gets the bow from the temple of time? Seems feasible for something that tech.
