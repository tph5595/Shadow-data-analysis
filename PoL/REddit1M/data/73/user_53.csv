42217,Wasn't the first or second Link also right handed?
45979,"I know about the mirrored sprite thing when he's facing left/right. I may have never played much of the first two games myself, but I've still played enough 2D Zelda to know that that it's just a mirrored sprite. After all, who the hell thinks (that other people think) that Link changes his handedness for 1/4 of the directions he faces? I simply thought that he was depicted as right handed in the artwork in one of the first two games, for whatever reason. Looked it up (which I should've done before I made my earlier post, TBH), and he is a leftie in both the first and second games. I don't know where the notion he was a rightie in either Zelda 1 or 2 came from, though."
