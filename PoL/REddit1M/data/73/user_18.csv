Not that there's anything wrong with that. But, I think that people should know that a lot of anime-style things make characters look kind of androgynous... and Zelda *is* a Japanese game.

I agree with you that the laser, hi-tech bow is much more exciting! Maybe they're playing out their original idea of having Zelda be set in some kind of futuristic setting."
