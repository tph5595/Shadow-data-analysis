8945,Now its [fixed](http://imgur.com/18QXili)

But if not, no he isn't... They make him right handed in games that use motion controls. (Wii Version of Twilight Princess, Skyward sword).  My guess is he is right handed again because there will be some motion controls in this game using the wiimote/nunchuck setup."
13551,"yeah true, now however, if they do implement a way to play with out motion controls, I hope they have his character model left handed. Though its probably not likely as that would add a hell of a lot more work for a visual aesthetic.  (Almost every animation Link had would have to be re-animated to reflect his handed-ness.) "
14247,Think of it like this.. go through your door to your outside.  Now mirror your image in your mind.... Your hand would go to the wrong side of the door right?  Thats the issue.. They would have to re animate his hand going to the proper side of the door with the door knob on it.  
17011,"Lol. One game he's truly right handed breaks 25 years of consistency.   You should do some reading on that one. Also, there has been mention of ""the mark on your left hand"" in several games. Pretty sure that counts as canon... Regardless, nintendo knows Link is Left-handed (ALBW, new ssb4 ect) they will only make him right-handed if needed for the game to play how they want it.  "
36980,"This is why I said ""one game he is truly right handed"", and thats skyward sword.  TP on Wii is just a Port of the gamecube one where they flipped the whole game in order to make him right handed. And yes, it was silly watching the sun rise in the west lol."
37159,"If they flipped the whole game, they wouldn't have to reanimate (hence TP) only if they decided to flip just the Link character model would they have to reanimate everything."
73974,Source please. Just saying its confirmed isn't enough for me.
122080,"Thanks for the info.  Also, thanks for putting words in my mouth by saying I think they won't utilize the gamepad, of course they are going to.  That said, none of us know if there will be any motion implementation.  The only clue I have is that they have Link right handed again, which usually means motion control from nintendos track record.

I don't understand why you had to be such a jerk about it when all I wanted is a source.  Sure hope you don't bitch your professors out when they ask you to provide a source for your research.  

"
129733,Probably just post the Link to the source...
130872,"I never said it wouldn't work with it.  You said that.  I only made a comment on the fact that they have Link Right-handed again that that it may involve some motion controls.  Based on Ninty's track record, Link is usually only Right-handed when there is a good reason for it.  Now, thats not to say the Gamepad can't be used while useing Wii-mote and nunchuck.  It really boils down to what we may or man not see with this game... Its only been trailer 1. lol"
133208,"&gt; All in all I think people are trying to squeeze way more information out of a trailer which simply doesn't contain all that much.

You got that right lol.  I was looking more at his shoulderstrap than how he shot his arrow... In Skyward sword, Link actually shoots his bow left handed (as to match how one holds the Wii-mote/nunchuck)  It really just comes down to what works best for the gameplay mode."
