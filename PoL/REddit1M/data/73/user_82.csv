63572,I hope I'm not the only one who hopes they can keep the outfit shown in the trailer... I know it's not the standard tunic but I loved it!
64816,"Are you referring to the ~~invisible~~ Hero's Clothes? I hope so too! I hope this is part of the new angle though - dropping the green tunic or making it optional, perhaps as a Jack of all stats outfit for customization?

Anyway, I hope I can keep this ""blue tunic + cloak"" outfit for as long as possible. The game's non-linear, right?"
65469,"I know. I'm gonna keep my fingers crossed that the outfits can be obtained at will too - that's usually not the case, is it?"
65875,What do tunics do in ALBW? Same thing as in OoT?
66266,"So there's a definite hierarchy with those. I was talking about multiple outfits with different benefits, so you would different shirts for different playstyles (e.g. more health vs. speed)."
