Only reason he was right handed because of the wiimote, if the game came out for the GC he would have been left handed"
48568,Actually that one does since it's the exact story that SS says about Hylia and her hero. So SS isn't the first Link since Zelda is also there.

65091,"Yup, open world they said, much like ALBW "
65784,"In ALBW yeah, you can get the blue tunic once you get the ability to go to lorule. Red tunic was in lorule castle so that was kinda forced to get in the end.
