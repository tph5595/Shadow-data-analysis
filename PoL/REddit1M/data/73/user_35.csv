32904,"To be fair, there's a TON of stuff in TP that's reliant on Link being left-handed: not just Link's Animations, but a large percentage of the enemies, several NPCs, and many cutscenes.

It was cheaper, and probably easier to just flip the whole game.

I'm also not complaining because the way it is now lets you flip it back relatively easily with no glitches, meaning it's totally possible to play it as it was on the GameCube. "
