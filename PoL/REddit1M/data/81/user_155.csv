I loved the dark feeling if the twilight, the realistic feel, and while it didn't have catchy ocarina tunes, the score was fantastic, and added to the ready great storytelling of the game. The controls were great, didn't feel too gimmicky, and really added to the game, especially pointer controls. Going back to joystick aiming felt just... weird after using the pointer, even though it's how I'd played my whole life previously."
