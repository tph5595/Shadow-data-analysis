7582,"TP was my favorite game to play. The new graphics of the Zelda world were so captivating, and the music is incredible. I used to go into Zora's Domain just to look at the glowing water and listen to the peaceful music. 

I loved riding Epona through Hyrule field too. The vastness of the entire game made it feel so rewarding to finally reach a new area. "
