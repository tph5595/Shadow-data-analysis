2951,I agree. For me it was the awesome story and realistic graphics that sold me on the game.
171374,"In TP, I felt a sense of danger from the get-go because of the small town secluded in the woods and the talk of twilight and general gloominess which was awesome. Then you max out on Ordon stuff and general uneasiness without actually doing much for a bit which I think is why some people get frustrated. In SS, I felt very much like the very, very, very beginning of Wind Waker when there's not really much danger and you can just hang out and enjoy life for a while while you're getting used to the game. Therefore I prefer the exposition of SS."
