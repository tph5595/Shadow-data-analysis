41331,And there hasn't been a half-decent 3D Zelda since. They need to make another one in the art style of TP.
41356,"The realistic graphics were what sold that game, mainly because that's truly what Zelda should look like."
41550,"I love the first half of TP and really dislike the last half.

The first half was fresh and new, with fucking amazing moments like that LotR-inspired fight between Link and King Bulbin.

It's too bad the second half resorted to the ""oh hey, it's Ganondorf"" plot, the game died for me after that."
41621,"Zant had the most incredible buildup (seriously, it was fucking scary), only to be a throwaway ""loopy"" character which entirely ruined the game's climax."
41674,"For me it wasn't chilling, it was ""oh hey, it's THIS stupid copout again.""

It's like Nintendo almost got it right with character pacing and buildup, then decided to throw it all away."
41858,"Unfortunately the music was dumbed down due to stupid excuses made by Miyamoto and other Nintendo execs claiming ""if it was orchestrated we couldn't do certain in-game cues,"" yet later they had no problem with doing orchestrated in-game cues with Super Mario Galaxy and Skyward Sword."
42042,"There's a reason they've mostly ditched the motion controls for the Wii U Zelda(s). The majority of people (yes, the majority, fight me) didn't like the motion shit they tried to force upon us, and I'm glad that they are reverting to the more traditional tried and true methods of control."
42093,"Skyward Sword is entirely skippable. Easily the worst 3D Zelda in the series, and one of the lowest points in the series overall.

I do recommend Wind Waker HD and A Link Between Worlds, however. These two represent what Zelda is truly about."
42196,"Not to mention how utterly fucked Nintendo's Zelda timeline is, the third fork ""failed hero"" timeline makes ZERO sense whatsoever due to no in-game events explaining it, and it makes far more sense to just say there were two forks instead of three."
42265,"....aaaand that's your opinion, and your opinion only."
