I enjoyed Twilight Princess. I wouldn't consider the time put into that game wasted, and I definitely wouldn't mind playing it again. However, it doesn't land in my Top 5 Zelda games. I played it for the first time last year (note that Skyward Sword was my first Zelda game ever). The graphics were alright, but they had not aged very well. The game could do with an HD remake (I would actually buy that). 

The main problems I had with the game included: The story was disjointed (You're supposed to be concerned about Ilia and the kids, then you don't see them for a long time, then they reappear and Ilia has her problem, and they disappear again, and then you ignore the main quest and help Ilia, it just didn't feel cohesive). Also, the game was way to easy. I feel like if they're going to make a darker, more mature game, it should be more punishing. It was about the same level of difficulty as The Wind Waker, and not even close to that of Ocarina or Majora. Lastly, its lack of originality. Did twilight princess really introduce anything new? Basic story, see Ocarina/ALttP. Dark tone, town in trouble, see Majora (Majora is a LOT more fucked up IMO). Transforming into a wolf? See Majora (with a lot more variation in gameplay in MM). Realistic graphics? Fair enough, although they didn't age well. Nothing about TP blew me away at any point.  

Things I did like about the game? The dungeons were all fantastic, Minda had great character development, the music was pretty good, some of the other characters were interesting enough. The sidequests and mini games were fun. The game was plenty long, and had lots of content to keep one busy. Combat was fun as Link, although under-utilized IMO (see too easy). Overall, TP is a solid addition to the Zelda cannon, one that I will gladly keep in my collection. It never blew my mind, but it satisfied me.

TL:DR, I enjoy TP, I don't love it, I don't hate it."
