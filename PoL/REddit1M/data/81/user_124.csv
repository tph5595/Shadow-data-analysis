30833,"Twilight Princess used to hold the number five slot in my list of top five Zelda games, but it was bumped out of that slot by Link Between Worlds.

It's by no means a bad game, but it's very hard to give a fair review of it. The game was good, but not as great as the hype leading up to it implied. When I think back to TP, I think of the nearly empty fields of Hyrule (with only the occasional bug to catch) and a *lot* of allusions to Ocarina of Time. With Wind Waker and its initial backlash (keyword there being initial) so recently in Nintendo's past, it really felt like they were trying too hard to emulate what made Ocarina of Time work. There's enough differences to say that TP is its own game of course, but enough of it felt like a retread that it was a little disappointing.

*All that said,* there are parts of the game where it really, *really* shines. Best boss battles in the series (Stallord being my personal favorite), some of the best dungeons in the series (I could gush about Snowpeak Ruins for ages), and arguably the best character in any Zelda game and definitely a fan favorite, Midna.

I'd say it still holds up, but it can't hold a candle to, in my opinion anyway, five other Zelda games. Personally I rank them as,

1. Majora's Mask

2. Ocarina of Time

3. Link to the Past

4. Wind Waker

5. Link Between Worlds"
