19891,"I'm sorry, but in what sense was Adventure of Link a flop? It was number 6 best selling game for NES, beaten only by the Mario games, Tetris, and the first Legend of Zelda. Yes, those of you who started with Ocarina of Time tend to dislike it because it's ""not really Zelda"", but there's still a major following. I honestly think Spirit Tracks is the installment that did the poorest, and even that didn't do abysmally. 

But in response to your question, it seems to me that Twilight Princess has been steadily increasing in popularity over time, but it was a self contained story, so odds are that particular iteration of Hyrule is done, and Midna with it."
