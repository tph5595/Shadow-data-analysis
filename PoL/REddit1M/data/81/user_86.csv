the game itself is pretty decent and I find myself revisiting it a surprising amount, but it is lacking in a lot of areas.

The overall idea of the visuals was good, and the concept art looks awesome, but in terms of the in-game graphics the game failed in the aesthetics department for me. It looks like the entire game was painted with mud, and not in a good way. It is just not really how I would have done dark fantasy zelda at all, the palette isn't balanced. If you want an example of how to make a brown-ish game look good, see Shadow of the Colossus or the Souls games, they're so much better looking than TP.

The story to me is nothing special and I'm honestly surprised at how many people are praising it. It didn't hit me emotionally in any significant way. Zant ended up disappointing me as a villain, I was not altogether pleased by Ganondorf being shoehorned in (especially considering how boring a villain I find him nowadays), and the character arcs ended almost as soon as they started for just about every character except Midna. With that said, I don't think any of the zelda stories or characters are that great anyway (excluding majora's mask and certain parts of wind waker), so I guess that's whatever.

Speaking of Midna, she's the thing about the game that most people remember, which makes sense as the game is more or less her story and she gets the most exposure and development out of any character in the game (and imo, to the detriment of everyone else). Personally I understand why people like her and I think she is a cool character overall, but I was never able to get on board with the hype train of monumental love she got. My favorite helpers in the series are still the King of Red Lions and Ezlo.

I also was not particularly fond of the wolf sections; i found them a bit boring and I didn't like the fact I was basically being Midna's bitch the whole time (as amusing as that was at times).

The musical score I also find to be very, very underwhelming. The main theme and all its variations (Midna's Lament, hyrule field, etc) is basically the only good song in the entire game. Everything else is honestly pretty bland and forgettable.

The game was caught in an unfortunate place in that was a gamecube game that ended up being ported to Wii to sell more copies, which led to people playing what is in my opinion the inferior version of the game. The port was really rushed, the controls are very tacked on and don't add much to the experience for me past the first few hours or so. Having since played the game on GCN, it's a lot more fun there, and the way it was meant to be played.

And overall, it just felt a bit too safe in most departments, and I feel that was to the detriment of the game's identity. Ocarina of Time is not even my favorite zelda so I don't really care that much for the idea of revisiting it.

But the dungeons were cool, the game was fun to play (especially if you were playing on gamecube), there were some decent and unique item ideas, some of the bosses were cool as fuck, etc. So it's not a bad game by any means, just not the most memorable or cherished zelda for me."

I understand that some people don't have a problem with that, but I feel that the other characters didn't get proper exposure and development so the character handling of the game in general feels very lopsided. Colin is the only other person I can think of that has a substantial character arc but his ends pretty quickly, and the village kids in general are mostly forgotten for the duration of the game.

What I find amusing about the music in particular is that the [two](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UGQFugRDtXE) [songs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-sDk9LM60qg) used to promote the game are a lot better and more memorable than anything in the game itself. You can imagine my disappointment from hearing those kickass songs and expecting an awesome soundtrack and then getting the mediocre score with lackluster synth."
