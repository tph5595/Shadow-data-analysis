I think it has amazing dungeon designs, some of the best boss battles in the entire series, and a lot of enjoyable stories centered around Midna, Ralis, Colin, etc.

I definitely remember watching the reveal trailer over and over again, and getting super excited at the very idea of sword fighting on horseback. That's still probably my favorite feature of the entire series."
