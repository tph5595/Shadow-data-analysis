19165,"Twilight Princess has had a weird legacy. Everyone loved it before and when it came out but for some reason people don't seem to remember it as much as Wind Waker, but in my opinion it is much more well rounded. It was with this game that Nintendo perfected the cinematic ""jaw dropping"" moments that continued with Skyward Sword. It wasn't stunningly innovative but if any game deserves a reinterpretation for modern times its OoT. The items such as the skate shoes were the most interesting the series had seen at that point, sadly there wasn't much of an opportunity to use some of them outside the dungeons. Bringing me to my only complaint that the overworld seemed kind of barren compared to other Zelda titles. Other than that, it starts slow but once it gets going the level of quality never falters."
