16707,"TP was a good game, but no where near as good as a lot of Zelda games especially when compared to WW since it was the game that came out before it.  I know it's an unpopular opinion here, but I'd give it a 6.5, maybe 7/10 (5 being average).  Cool art style, great music, standard gameplay, only a few interesing dungeon designs, and no interesting (except for the standard ones) items with the exception of ooccoo(?).  I liked the towns, villages, and setting a lot though.  Wolf link was kind of gimmicky, and should of been scrapped. All imo of course."
