Fabulous game. I loved the art style, total polar opposite of WW (which I also loved) but it worked great. I really enjoyed the darkness of it too. I wasn't sure if I liked Midna at the start, but by the end I was a huge fan.


A few small criticisms though. I don't think the game really needed Ganondorf. Zant was shaping up to be an awesome dark brooding antagonist. Not to say Ganon wasn't brilliant written (that attempted execution cutscene was amazing), but Zant could have stood by himself.


Also wasn't mad about the wolf mechanics. Felt a little unresponsive and I didn't like the combat parts. Like when I'd go in to finish a Poe and it seemed to jump around randomly.


The ending was epic and confusing in equal parts. The Zant neck snap seems have people divided over what it meant. But it was brilliantly dark and I loved it."
