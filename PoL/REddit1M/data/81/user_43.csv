15099,"TP is the game that made me fall in love with the Legend of Zelda series. Its appearance, its music, Link and Midna's character development, the whole thing just makes for a powerful experience. I've since played most of the other games and I while don't think TP is the **best** game, I don't agree at all that it's one of the worst. "
