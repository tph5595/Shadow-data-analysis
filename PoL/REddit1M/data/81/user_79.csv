21011,"To me Twilight Princess is one of the most solid Zelda games. The combat is very fluid with all the moves, the bosses are generally fun and it has some of the best dungeons in the series (Arbiter's Grounds and Hyrule Castle both come to mind as exceptionally memorable).

I really like how they found new uses for old items as well as the combination mechanic and the targeting controls for the bow and hookshot were the by far best out of any of the games (RIP Skyward Sword's way of aiming, may it never return).

Personally I think it's one of the better Zelda games. I rank it over most of the other 3D ones, probably the only one of those I like more is Majora's Mask.

It's a great game but a little lackluster in the innovation department (I'm looking at you Wolf-form)."
