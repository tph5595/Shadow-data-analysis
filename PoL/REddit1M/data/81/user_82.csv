21591,"TP is my favourite zelda game. I know it's not the best zelda game, but it's still my favourite.  My fondest memory with the game is listening to katy perry's second album shortly after it came out. I really liked the song ""the one that got away"" so I had it on repeat while I was doing the goron mines.  Now whenever I hear the song all I can think of is sniping moblins on my way to the boss door."
