It's my favorite Zelda game, and I think it holds up to OoT despite having tons of nostalgia for OoT."
30501,Nah. OoT is only seen that way because it was groundbreaking for the time. 
30577,"No, they were definitely easy. It was a bit stressful but very easy."
30695,"Maybe you don't like it for some reason, but no. It was very popular when it came out, it lost it's popularity, and it's been getting it back for some time now."
30849,"Yep. I prefer GC version. It's really the definitive version. It was made for he GC, not the Wii."
30887,I really doubt it.
31138,"What's with the downvote?  
Anyway, I never said they weren't. It switches places with TP as my favorite Zelda game often. But it's not the perfect game, it's not some special godly unattainable brilliance.  
TP was just as good as OoT if not better. You were complementing OoT's side stories and details, but really TP has it too.  
I'm pretty blinded by nostalgia when I comes to OoT, and I do think it's a fantastic game, but it really says something about TP that I can see past my nostalgia to like it as much as I do.  
It's all subjective, of course."
35774,The problem is that it isn't mediocre.
37020,The mythos/lore work fine though. It's all nicely out together and makes sense with the canon. I don't understand. I think having Zelda lore is great for it. Seeing old Zelda enemies reimagined just adds to how cool the game is.
