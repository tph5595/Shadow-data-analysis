7309,"For me, Twilight Princess was a coming of age game.  I was just old enough to where I could understand and appreciate the themes, but still young enough to be spooked by the dungeon and spirits at the beginning, the shadow beasts, and the cutscenes.  It was also the first Zelda game (much to my chagrin) that I was able to play through and beat by myself.  Even the controls, which I was skeptical about at first, worked well, and especially enjoyed the riding combat mechanics.  The art style and character development made the game thoroughly enjoyable, and I can honestly say that I wanted to cry when the journey was over.  I felt like this game does the best job of developing Link as a character, which few if any other Zelda games even attempt to do.  And of course there's Midna.  No other Zelda game makes you love your companion as much as Twilight Princess does.  I paused the game at the part where Link has to save Midna after Zant tries to kill her with light, simply because the music (Midna's Lament) was so melancholy and beautiful.  Little moments of her dialogue and, of course, the ending, make it impossible not to love Midna.  I'm going to go back to the fishing hole now and catch me a Hylian Loach."
