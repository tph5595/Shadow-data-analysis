14513,Hyrule Field for TP easily becmae my favorite Hyrule Field overall.  It remains in a constant rotation for driving down the highway.  
16019,"I played it in 2010 for the first time and sadly, it was right around the same time I met a girl who I would end up chasing for the next year and a half.  I've replayed it plenty since then but then music alone always reminds me of her.  Still, amazing game and altho I know it won't happen, Midna is hands down the one character I would love to see again."
