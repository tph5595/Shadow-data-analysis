I really disliked Twilight Princess. To me, as a longtime fan who pre-ordered and got the Wii and TP on day one, Twilight Princess was my first instance with being totally bored with a Zelda world. It seemed that even though everything was bigger and better - the scope was larger, the visuals were better, and the story was more ""mature"" - for the first time, Hyrule felt empty and lifeless to me. 

I finished it. I logged about 40 or 50 hours into it, and ended up with a good amount of completed side quests and collectables. But for the first time EVER playing a Zelda, I was completely disillusioned. "
