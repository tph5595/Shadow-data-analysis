24537,"tl;dr Shadow Temple had creepier aesthetics than anything in TP

Is that all you were getting at?"
24636,You like the Lakebed Temple but hate Jabu's belly? How? Are you talking about OoT Jabu-Jabu?
24764,"TP's motion controls are fine. All you have to do is twitch your wrist and he swings his sword. Other than that, and aiming when you shoot, that's about the end of it. I loved TP's motion controls. SS, on the other hand, was an exercise in futility."
24900,I only played the Wii version and this is my favorite game. SS is my least favorite. Play that and you'll be begging for TP controls.
59061,"I didn't say it wasn't, I'm just surprised somebody hates Jabu-Jabu's Belly more than LBT. TP was my first Zelda game, so the LBT was like my Water Temple. I only recently played though OoT for the first time, and I enjoyed Jabu's belly. Didn't think it was too difficult or boring, too easy or too simple. It was a solid dungeon. Carrying Ruto around was weird but it worked."
59877,"I like how I get downvoted for asking why you like it, and you get upvoted for saying ""it's gross."" You must have never played anything like an FPS game before, where you're blowing peoples' brains out. I think that's a little more gross than the inside of a fish."
60194,"A member of a happy Yeti couple, turned into a giant, Twilit-infested monster called Blizzeta, isn't dark?

Zant attempting to kill Midna by forcibly exposing her to Lanayru's light isn't dark?

Ganondorf, surviving an execution, murdering a sage, and spending years banished to the Twilight Realm isn't dark?

Link's friends and the people of Hyrule literally turning into monsters isn't dark?

The tone of the game is incredibly dark. From Zant's hostile takeover of the Twilight Realm to his takeover of Hyrule - the world is quite literally covered in darkness, literally. I'm not trying to turn this into OoT vs. TP, but what's the darkest thing you deal with in OoT? Returning to Castle Town and seeing Redeads? Not much else has changed."
64697,"Fair enough. To each his own. I guess I dislike the Shadow Temple, and I'm not really sure why. That is to say, I *enjoy* the Shadow Temple, but it's my least favorite OoT dungeon. For the record, I do like the Lakebed Temple. I just usually hear it cursed, along with the Water Temple. It's rare to see somebody praise it, then say they disliked a simple dungeon like Jabu. But somebody else raised a good point, LB Temple is complex, and that's interesting. Jabu is simple and doesn't look nearly as clean as LB Temple. If you're actually looking for a challenging dungeon, LBT offers that and more."
64800,"That's a good point. Lakebed Temple's complexity was frustrating to me (especially being my first Zelda game) but I can certainly understand appreciating and enjoying that complexity. Plus, aesthetics aside (though I would like to point out that Jabu-Jabu's Belly could look great with TP-style graphics) there are annoying mechanics to Jabu's belly, like carrying around Ruto."
67796,"Before I type anything else, I want to say that everybody is entitled to their opinion. I'm completely okay with you liking Skyward Sword and disliking Twilight Princess, despite my opinion being the opposite. I'm glad there's people like you out there, because if everybody felt the same way I did about Skyward Sword, it would have gone down as a failure and a terrible game. I wouldn't want to see that for a Zelda entry. Anything I say is not a personal affront on your feelings towards the games, or you as a person. I simply love playing Devil's Advocate, and one of my good friends feels the same way you do. We frequently debate TP vs. SS. Anyway, to the point.

&gt;in TP, there was no point to the motion control. twitching the remote, in essence, just pressed the b button, except with a lower success rate than a button.

I agree. But I think a typical Zelda game benefits far more from this style of play than Skyward Sword's required specificity. While it obviously evolved into something less, the concept started out fine - you swing your Wiimote, and Link swings his sword. The fact that most people will choose to lazily jerk their wrist rather than imitate a full sword swing is something that *should* be possible. That way, you can have the best of both worlds. The people that want to stand up and pretend they're Link can do so, and the people that want to play this like a typical, OoT-style console Zelda can (mostly) do it their way.

&gt;and the aiming just moved the curser like a joystick, it didn't actually point.

I guess I'm dumb, but I don't really see the difference... either way, your reticle moves where you point the Wiimote. This was one of the things that seemed largely unchanged between the two games, though I notice that my cursor shakes a little in SS (obviously because my hand isn't perfectly steady) whereas it remains firmly on point in TP because the controls aren't precise enough to detect my slight wobbling. I'm not really even saying one is better than the other here, just explaining how they felt different to me.

&gt;the problem came when SS came out with it's actually functional full motion controls, which were brilliantly done, and people couldn't adjust. people expected the twitch=button format, and got confused when they got motion control instead.

Again, I agree with you. Sorry to argue semantics, but you said ""people couldn't adjust"" and what you're really saying is people wouldn't adjust. But actually the way you put it is quite right. I literally **couldn't** adjust. No matter how long I played the game. I popped in Skyward Sword and walked up to a Deku Baba after getting my sword, starting twitching my wrist Ã  la Twilight Princess, and watched it defend against literally every single blow. Sure, it didn't take me long to figure out that I needed a precise horizontal slash - but the problem came when I literally died trying to get my Wiimote to slash completely horizontally. No matter how I held or swung the Wiimote, it always seemed to come out slightly diagonally. To make matters more frustrating, I also have to think about flicking my nunchuk in just the right way at just the right time to block any possible incoming attacks. Incoming attacks that I wouldn't have to worry about, if there was just a button I could push that would make me swing my sword horizontally whenever I wanted to. Oh, and if I do manage to actually defend myself against an attack, I have to make sure I don't break my shield while doing it. 

You said it well. Twilight Princess had mock motion controls, Skyward Sword had brilliant, fully functional motion controls. If you look at the whole package, it's great what they did. The problem is that it's just... not... quite... perfect. If I could actually get my sword to swing horizontally 100% of the time, the game would be glorious.

I chalked up my failed Deku Baba encounter to inexperience. In fact, I was exhilarated at the prospect of facing a Zelda game with a real challenge. As we both mentioned before, I figured I just wasn't adjusted to the new controls. I was conditioned to the ""easy"" style of Twilight Princess. And I did start to think of how simple OoT and TP were. Because that's how 90% of enemies are - you walk up to them, swing you sword repeatedly, and win. Now I'm having to tactically think about nearly every engagement. Sweet! ... Two dungeons later, I'm still not used to the motion controls and absolutely hate this game. The problem is that every single enemy requires exact precision and some sort of strategy to beat. Which makes long excursions incredibly frustrating and... well, long. I literally (and I do mean literally) had more trouble in the Forest Temple trying to cut down this one Skultulla with my beetle, then run down and perform Fatal Blow on it, than I did beating Ghirahim at the end of said dungeon. All because of motion controls. Not only are they difficult to be precise with, the game absolutely smothers you in a heap of gyrometric goodness. Everything from Loftwing flying to rolling bombs is done with your motion controls. And all it ever did was ruin the immersion. It reminded me that I'm not Link, I'm playing a video game holding shitty plastic controllers in my hands that I'm constantly having to look at and think about to get to do what I want. I'm not trying to sound cheesy, like I play every game imagining I *am* the protagonist - I just mean that when I play a game, I want to get into it and have fun. But I didn't feel like I was playing The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword. I felt like I was playing Wii Motion Plus Gimmicks: 2010 edition. Ironically, you described my feelings about this game in your original comment berating Twilight Princess:

&gt;it was built to be a push button game, suddenly shoved onto a motion control platform.

I understand that this is literally what was done in TP's case, but it was so similar to button-mapped controls that it worked well as a kind of hybrid. But Skyward Sword took that idea and went full monty. Now, nearly everything that was controlled by a button before is controlled by your motion. Yet, it's the same game as OoT and TP. I can understand you wanting me to literally mimic Link's motions, like swinging his sword and maybe even rolling bombs. But, fuck, I'm not trying to pretend I'm really flying a Loftwing here! Can I please just press A to ascend and B to descend or something? Come on!

&gt;anyone who says the controls are better in TP than SS obviously didn't understand how they worked, and probably suck at video games.

I really understand where you're coming from. Really, I do. And if you've somehow made it this far, I'd like to remind you of what I originally said - I respect your opinion, and I'm not saying that my feelings are intrinsically ""right"" while yours are ""wrong."" TP is a joke, as far as motion controls go. It's not a good imitation if Link at all, really. Especially compared to Skyward Sword, which is indeed brilliant. Move your sword in a circle and Link will do the same. Poke and he'll poke. Chop like you have an axe and he will too. Do any of these things in TP and they'll all have the same result. Link will swing his sword. But, ""dumb"" as it may be, this is how motion controls should be, until they can perfect what Skyward Sword has. Because it is not perfect. Link has the ability to swing his sword in like eight unique directions, but until the Wiimote can accurately, 99% of the time, register what I'm trying to input, I think Skyward Sword will be inferior. But hey, that's just like, my opinion, man.

As for your snide implication that people who prefer Twilight Princess over Skyward Sword suck at video games, we both know that generalization is not true. While I like to think I'm at least competent at video games (I've played COD, Guitar Hero, and Smash Bros Melee as well as other random, less known games at a competitive level) I could very well just suck. But I've played a lot of Wii games (as well as those of other consoles) and there aren't a lot of games that can frustrate me like this one can. The biggest problem is that I know what I need to do, and what I want to do, but I feel like the game won't let me do it. If that's just because my eye-hand coordination just blows, so be it. I ""suck"" at games like these, need to be baby-fed games like Twilight Princess, and I'm glad they exist. And given my perceived reaction to the two games by the community, I'd say I'm not alone.

**tl;dr** A nerd rants about Zelda. Move along, nothing to see here, folks."
