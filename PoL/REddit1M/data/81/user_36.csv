14428,"Twilight Princess is my favorite game. I think it made a big step in the right direction by introducing Midna, a sidekick who we actually cared about. Twilight Princess was also the first Zelda I ever played, so it holds a special place in my heart. Plus, I honestly think it had the best music in the series. "
