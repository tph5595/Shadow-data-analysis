14272,"I'm replaying the game now (up to Lakebed), and I'm surprised at how well the game has aged. The environment has some polygons, but it gives Hyrule a more stylistic flair to it. The dungeons are some of the best in the series. There isn't a single dungeon that I dislike, unlike some entries in the series (I'm looking at you, Jabu Jabu's Belly). The combat is great, and I love how the skills are essentially Wind Waker Link's parries without being broken. Riding around Hyrule Field doing hit &amp; runs is great, although I wish the trigger for the field's combat music wasn't so damned sensitive.

In all honesty, you really shouldn't have to pay to get out of the lake. That's a bit much."
