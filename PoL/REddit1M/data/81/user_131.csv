34948,"TP is probably my favorite Zelda game since ALTTP.  Great music, great graphics, great tone and atmosphere, and the wolf parts were a lot of fun (sometimes I didn't want to turn back into human Link).  Midna was also a great character, and a lot more likable than Navi or that thing from Skyward Sword.  Some of the action sequences were epic, and the blending of cinematic and gameplay was great.

EDIT:  Almost forgot, the fighting system was fantastic too.  I love the special moves and how you had to incorporate each of your different fighting styles and tactics into the final fights with Ganon, including a final sword duel.  Perfect!"
