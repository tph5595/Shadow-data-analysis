21003,"downvote me to hell. if you want, but you wont be adhering to rediquette. this is my opinion and if you dont like it, just move along.

twilight princess was the turning point for me wherein nothing i ever looked forward to would ever again live up to the hype and not leave me disappointed. (skyrim being the exception).

I was 19 when it came out and was relishing looking forward to reliving the wonder I had when I played ocarina of time at 11/12 years old. 

i hated the game. maybe if i had played it on gamecube I would have liked it more, but the wii version turned out for me to be the worst nintendo developed zelda ever.

so many cliches. ""darkness"" for darkness' sake which when coated with nintendo ""cant be too dark"" made it seem cheesy.

i was 16/17 when that famous e3 trailer had me so incredibly hyped. i was 19 by the time i had gotten the game. too much time in between perhaps? 

wind waker was a far better game. skyward sword was a far better game. twilight princess was just a huge let down that didnt know what it wanted to be.


and i know it's the biggest knitpick there is, but my biggest gripe with all of nintendo's games from twilight princess forward is that the character's mouths move when they speak, but since there is no voiceover, no sound comes out. i flipping hate it, and we can all thank tlp for it. 

that and midna's voice. dear god i hated that game.


and i know i cant be the only one. why is it that tlp sold 8 million. skyward sword couldnt even break 3.75 (on a console with 100million units!). most would agree that skyward sword is the better game; however, people were just not feeling it in part b/c of tlp"
