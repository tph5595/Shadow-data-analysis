45693,"I love the more realistic nature of the graphics in TP, but I don't understand how people don't seem to appreciate the stylization of wind waker. I liked the darker nature of TP, but wind waker also had a perfectly matching style for the storyline. Giving WW TP graphics wouldn't have fit so well with the storyline - it would have felt awkward and mismatched. 

I think the problem comes in with the fact that Nintendo will always err more on the side of family friendly than dark, which is why we may not see TP style graphics so readily again since LoZ is a Nintendo franchise. That being said, I don't think the stylization they've gone with in some of their other games is by any means bad, or should be judged as such just because its not perfectly realistic like every other major game title in the gaming world.

This is of course my own opinion, and I understand and respect the fact that you may feel otherwise. I just wanted to offer my opinion up into the discussion because as an art major, I feel WW is under-appreciated. "
46305,"I can respect that opinion. I loved TP, and still appreciate it as a Zelda game, but, at least at first, the storyline felt really alien to me after MM and OoT. 

I think the different ways that they've integrated different stories into the same lore has been incredibly interesting (most notably in my mind is the interplay of lore between OoT and WW), but (and it's been awhile) I felt like TP was almost trying to be OoT and fit the typical ""zelda"" storyline really well, but at the same time, was just skewed enough to feel like they were redoing the mythos for the series.

I agree with someone above and think it had a few issues with being a bit disjointed at times, but I don't think that TP was mediocre for it, even as a Zelda game. You have interesting thoughts on it, and I would love to see this higher up and know what other people think (and even though you seem to disagree with most people in this thread with that opinion and would probably be met with hostility)."

(sorry for taking so long to respond)"
