2591,"I finished it once on GameCube and (regretfully) traded in my copy for a Wii copy when I got my Wii.  I never finished it again on Wii.  Now that I have my WiiU, it is on my replay list.  I still like the game immensely and think it has held up well.  The Wolf Link sections seemed to be a distraction to me when I tried my second playthrough.  I remember the ending battle feeling very cinematic and feeling very accomplished when I completed it.  I think it ranks even if not slightly better than Skyward Sword in my opinion.  But I have this thing where I have to play the newest title when it comes out, beat it and then let it sit for a while (years even) before I play it again.  The second time through solidifes the epicness for me.  They all seem to hold up in my eyes and nostalgia doesn't cloud the gameplay on the second time through."
