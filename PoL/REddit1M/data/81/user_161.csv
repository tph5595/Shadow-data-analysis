55611,And the best-looking Link.

THANK you...I feel like no one ever acknowledges this when fapping over OoT. ...I have a sneaking suspicion it may be because they're too young to have played LttP when it came out."
55774,The formulaic approach is part of what I like about Zelda games.
123704,"To me, that's just what Zelda is. You go on a quest to get what you need to earn the Master Sword, then you go on an even bigger quest with the Master Sword to rescue the maidens/sages/whatever and save Hyrule from Ganon.

Link's Awakening was really fun too. It dropped some of those elements but kept the basic ""go around to 8 dungeons and collect the set of magic things to unlock the final area"" scheme intact.

I don't love Wind Waker, and I don't really even like any of the other Game Boy Zeldas. Except Link Between Worlds, but that's because it was LttP fanservice."
