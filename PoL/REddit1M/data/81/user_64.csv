19211,"What?  Are you forgetting Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask?

Zelda is generally more realistic than cartoony.  There are only a handful of hyper-cartoony games when compared to the many 'realistic' ones. Wind Waker and the DS games are really the only ones... the rest kind of fall between realistic and stylised realistic, like SS.

I can almost guarantee you that the Zelda for Wii U will be closer to the realistic side, because Nintendo is gonna want to show off the hardware capabilities.  Also take note that OoT and TP are the two best-selling Zelda games, and both are realistic.  Hell, I'd say OoT, despite having dated graphics, was far more 'real' that Twilight Princess, which actually had *a lot* of cartoony elements.

So yeah, don't doubt that you'll see another realistic Zelda soon."

What dark settings?  It didn't even have a legitimate shadow temple.  I can't really think of anything dark about the game, other than aesthetics..."
19612,Were... very easy?
20448,"No, they really were.  It may have been somewhat 'tense' in your mind, being chased and all... but they move *very, very* slowly, giving you *wayy* more time than you need to move the orb.

And even if they do grab the orb.. you can clawshot it right back."
20716,"It was just a gloomy couple of buildings, though.  Other than the actual lighting... it wasn't really ""dark"", just kind of melancholy. 

""Dark"" is walking into the Shadow Temple in OoT, seeing the walls made from skulls, torture devices covered in blood, and Dead Hands holding you in place as they chew on you with their absurdly massive jaw."
22627,It was more akin to the Spirit temple than anything else. It did have some creepy undead things but it was *nowhere* near the level of the previous Shadow Temple.
52592,Pretty much lol.  Point is Twilight Princess just isn't as dark as everyone claims it is.  It's just *literally* dark... like dimming the lights.
64994,"&gt;A member of a happy Yeti couple, turned into a giant, Twilit-infested monster called Blizzeta, isn't dark?

That's a hell of a stretch, and most of that situation was generally pretty comical.  From the silly designs/speech, to the Man-E-Faces style face switch... it wasn't any darker than any other boss, if anything I'd say it was a little more light-hearted, especially gratuitously sweet end bit.

&gt;Zant attempting to kill Midna by forcibly exposing her to Lanayru's light isn't dark?

No darker than any other instance of an evil Zelda character trying to harm someone lol.

&gt;Ganondorf, surviving an execution, murdering a sage, and spending years banished to the Twilight Realm isn't dark?

It's just about as dark as it is in *every other Zelda game featuring him*.  Him taking out the sage sure wasn't 'gentle', but it wasn't on the same level as taking out an entire city.

&gt;Link's friends and the people of Hyrule literally turning into monsters isn't dark?

Which of Link's friends turn into monsters, again?  The only person implied to turn into a shadow beast is a nameless woman in Kakariko.  Everyone else just says ""Eww what a big bug!"".

&gt;The tone of the game is incredibly dark.

It really isn't.  It puts up a facade of being dark, but it has barely any truly dark substance.  In that, it's shallow.

&gt;what's the darkest thing you deal with in OoT?

Seeing as TP is essential OoT 2.0, almost every element can be compared, and OoT always comes out on top.  

The artistic, misty death of a sage?  How about the slow, realistic death of a soldier... whose corpse remains after he dies, right in front of you?  Or the depressed man who dies in the Lost Woods and becomes a Stalfos? Or the guardian who watched over Link after his parents died in a war?

A castle covered in a barrier?  How about a castle and its city decimated?  Hyrule covered in some (quickly removed)overcast, with unusually large insects?  How about Hyrule after 7 years of being defenseless to Ganondorf?  Kokiri Forest covered in monsters, 90% of the Gorons seemingly wiped out, Zora's Domain frozen over for good, as opposed to for a few minutes.  Talk to anyone in Kakariko or Lon Lon Ranch, and they'll tell you how shitty things have been for the past 7 years.  Now, talk to someone in TP's Hyrule Market Town... and they'll probably not even have noticed anything was wrong.

This isn't even getting to the actual areas and monsters or anything like that.  Twilight Princess doesn't even hold a candle to OoT or MM when it comes to level design, monster design and overall dark ambiance.  Compare the OoT Forest Temple to TP Forest Temple.  Compare the Shadow Temple/Well to the Arbiter Ground's.  Compare Ganon's Castle to Hyrule Castle.

It just really wasn't any darker than any other Zelda game, and lots of them had far darker elements.  It was more... gloomy than anything else.  "
