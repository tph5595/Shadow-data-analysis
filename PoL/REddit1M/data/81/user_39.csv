14641,"Twilight Princess ranks very high up in my favorites, because of the atmosphere. I think it goes hand in hand with the fact that Majora's Mask is my favorite title in the entire series (I haven't played The three most recent handhelds or Skyward Sword completely, though I doubt finishing any of them would change this opinion). The main story in MM, the back story of the characters you meet and how their stories wrap up, and just how heavy and dark MM was as a Zelda title really spoke to me, and really touched me as I grew up.

Twilight Princess brought all of that back to me. When I was playing it, I couldn't help feel the same way I did playing through Majora's Mask. I loved how adult the game felt, especially considering the fact that Majora's Mask was only a single console title behind Wind Waker. Both MM and TP will always hold special places in my heart not just in the Zelda franchise, but for gaming as a whole. The fact that Nintendo made two very grown up, mature Zelda titles (not to say that the other titles are immature/kid-like) gives me hope that they will do another title like this. And if they do, that will be what will bring me out of the ""not buying a Nintendo console"" mindset that I'm in now (Also because of this I will never finish Skyward Sword).

To specifically touch on your questions, I would say that there is a bit of a divide. I wouldn't say it is a flop in any sense of the word in the series, but there are definitely those that I've met that don't like the stance that the game went, and hated the wolf sections. I felt it continued to show us how ""adult"" and real-life the Zelda series can be. "
