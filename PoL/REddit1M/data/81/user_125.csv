If you think about it, if they wanted to make Link right-handed without flipping the world, that would screw up a lot of the combat animations and require flipping most of the enemies as well - at that point it was much easier to just flip the entire game."
31737,"Your comment about the music is exactly how I feel. The game really has only the one good theme, and it's overused instead of having other, more unique themes for different places. All the other music is either really boring or a direct ripoff of OoT's music (cases in point: Zora's Fountain and Temple of Time entrance, to a lesser extent Lost Woods).

Of course, the music is not the only thing TP blatantly rips off of OoT...

Oh, and thank you for being apparently the only other person besides me who feels that TP is too much about Midna. While playing it, I felt like I was her lackey rather than the main character."

The trailer music was SO GOOD! I remember being super hyped about the game when the later trailer with ""Orchestra Piece #1"" in it came out, mostly because of the music. At the time I didn't own any consoles whatsoever and hadn't even played OoT, just the Game Boy ones and ports of the first three. I guess it was also because it was the first Zelda game that came out after I was already paying attention to the franchise. I finally played it in 2011, not too long after finally getting into OoT (in 2009) and I couldn't help but feel quite a bit of deja vu with all the ripping off of superficial things."
