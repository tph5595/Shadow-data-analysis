30353,"That's what I think was the problem. With all the circulating fan theories of a chronological game timelines, Nintendo found the most plausible one and essentially confirmed it as truth - because of this, they forced SS to predecess the other games in an attempt to form a 'coherent timeline' - this restricted the plot and essentially became its own undoing as it contradicts plot points in games that success it chronologically.  
  
Of course, this is only my opinion, and I could spend forever ranting about my dislike for SS - so I'm going to stop riiiight... now."
