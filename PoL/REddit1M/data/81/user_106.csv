Ocarina of Time just had so many little details and side stories that made it amazing, TP has some of that too, but it's not as memorable. Ocarina of Time fully encapsulates what The Legend Of Zelda is, and I don't think there will ever be another Zelda game that can top it. It was essentially the perfect game. "
