23325,"I waited 10 hours in the winter cold to pick up my Wii on that fateful November day. I was a college kid and didn't have a lot of money but I knew that by saving myself for the Wii and TP would be worth it.

When I loaded everything up and saw the intro screen, I fell to my knees as tears rolled down my face. It was like waiting for that moment and when it finally comes it's so overwhelming. We waited for a game like TP for 4 years, 4 fucking years and my God did they deliver.

Everything about the game I loved and I am sure I skipped a handful of classes for it. If Nintendo would just go in that direction again I bet they would corral a lot of people back in. Give us blood and give us death, give us that macabre feeling that makes our hair stand on end (those monsters underneath the well and shadow temple? fuck naw!). 

It's a Zelda we want again and hope for, and if they listen, we will receive. "
