25166,"The LoZ series is interesting in that it's had several ""definitive"" games.  Of course these are somewhat arguable but I think most folks will tend to agree. 

Definitive LoZ game #1: The Legend of Zelda.  This game set up the very basics.  Multiple dungeons, each with a boss, explorable world, using items to figure out puzzles. 

Definitive LoZ game #2: A Link to the Past.  This entry built on the same style as the original LoZ but also built up many themes that have been used in most of it's successors.  

Definitive LoZ game #3: Ocarina of Time.  This is largely contested as THE definitive LoZ game as it was the first 3D one.  However, it did use a lot of design and themes from LttP.  With the success of OoT it enabled Nintendo to get a little bit more creative. 

Where am I going with this?  Well it was after OoT that the timeline split and Nintendo used that as an opportunity to have each timeline have it's own style.  This brought us the Hyrule Decline path that already had it's ""style"" pretty well established, the Hero is Successful (Child) path that continued the OoT style with Majora's Mask, and  a little bit later we saw the Hero is Successful (Adult) bring a new style with The Wind Waker. 

Where does TP come into play here?  Well obviously it is what evolved from the Oot/MM style.  They recognized that the players wanted a more ""dark"" style and they had a really nice response from the ""realistic"" OoT.  Now with much more powerful hardware they could actually render more humanoid and believable characters....and Twilight Princess was created.  

Back to the topic of Definitive LoZ Games and why I feel that TP is arguably the successor to the Definitive OoT in the same way LttP succeeded LoZ as The Definitive 2D LoZ.  LttP absolutely set the standard for all future 2D LoZ games...I don't think you'll find too many people to disagree with that.  

I feel that TP has accomplished the same thing with the Hero is Successful (Child) chronology 3D games.  It built on everything OoT did as a pioneer and, compared to other games of the time, it was close to flawless.  In 2006 we also saw released: Oblivion, Kingdom Hearts 2, Okami, Gears of War, Call of Duty 3, and more fine games... but compare the gameplay, style, and graphics...and consider it was released on the GameCube (and Wii).  It was at least on par with any other game released that year.  

Fast Forward to 2012 and finally the next installment of the LoZ series that uses the same style as defined in Twilight Princess is released.  Skyward Sword.  Granted this game was set chronologically earlier but Nintendo went with it because they recognized that the fan base liked the style and feel of TP.  The Wind Waker style is good too, but it just doesn't satisfy like having a version of Link that we can impress our selves on.  For anybody that's played SS, you know that you learn to feel empathy for Link, Zelda, even Groose, as well as the other characters throughout the game world.  

So what's next?  We've all seen the teaser for Warriors of Hyrule or whatever it's called, I forget right now.  In interviews with Nintendo they've said that they're going to continue to use the same ""style"" as TP and SS. And I, for one, am excited to see what this new Zelda Wii-U brings.  

**tl;dr**: LoZ1 pioneered and LttP perfected as the definitive 2D Zelda game.  OoT pioneered and TP perfected as the definitive 3D Zelda game.
