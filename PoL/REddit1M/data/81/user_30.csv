Nintendo seems to have noticed as well, as this was the last formulaic Zelda game I've seen so far."

To me it detracts from the game. ""Ok we'll do these three levels, get the master sword, do these next 5 levels, then win. Ok, here's the water temple, forest, Goron fire, etc. Here's the bow, hookshot, etc.""

It might just be me, but I don't like knowing exactly what's coming. And I don't want to be able to compare one game to another in that much detail. ""Oh yeah, Ocarina's water temple was the absolute worst! This one isn't nearly as hard!""

When I started playing Link Between Worlds I was very refreshed by the differentness. Hell, even Wind Waker felt different to me just by deviating from formula."
