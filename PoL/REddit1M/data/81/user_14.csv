9494,"It's the only time you can find those damn poes, and there's no in-game way to keep track of which ones you found, and no way to quickly switch between day and night.

I love that game but as a Zelda completionist I hate those damn poes.  "
18385,"I used the wait time to do some fishing, so it wasn't all bad (fishing in Twilight Princess was fun). 

In my first game though, I had one poe left and had no idea where it was. I searched the entire world up and down several times, busting out guides to check every single location again and again, before giving up. I'm still convinced the game ate one of the poes or didn't give me credit for one or something. Next time I played I found them all without issue though, and I've slept soundly ever since.

Not really sure why they didn't go the OoT skultula route of putting a little icon on map to signify if you found all the poes in an area. Would've saved a lot of us completionist nerds a lot of grief. It's pretty much my only complaint about the game and it seems like such an obvious and simple oversight."
25897,"Yeah, in my case it was just a matter of playing the whole game again and finding them all that time. It's possible my game glitched (I went over that list at least five times) but the fact that there's a poe probably hiding in that save file somewhere still drives me crazy."
