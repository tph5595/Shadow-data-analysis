114121,I loved TP. It doesn't have that classic feel of OoT or MM but I loved the puzzles and learning all the different fighting skills.
114237,Have you never played SS. The first 1-2 hours of the game doesn't have any fighting or anything. It's just Link running around talking to people. It doesn't take that long for TP to start to get interesting.
