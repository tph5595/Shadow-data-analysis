40292,"I have sour memories of this game that still hold me off from playing it to this day, but it actually has nothing to do with the gameplay itself. I remember when this finally came out I was a Junior in high school, and I think I either got it on like a Wednesday or Thursday for Gamecube and was playing the crap out of it/binge playing it after school, and on friday there was this big show of local bands at a VFW I went to, and after it was over I planned on playing it more but after taking a shower I came down with a horrible case of the flu. Not only this, but when I did fall asleep I was having Twilight Princess-related dreams due to doing nothing but binge playing, and because of the flu had immense nausea. It lasted all weekend and really sucked, and it totally ruined the game for me, memories of Twilight Princess to this day still cause me to remember a immense headache and puking, its so far been the only LoZ game I've never replayed after beating. Even reading/looking at the Hyrule Historia pages about the game invoke that feeling of nausea for me still x_x"
