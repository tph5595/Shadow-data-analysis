I took the exact course of actions you took, the exact same struggles, the exact same frustration. Guide after guide after guide. It's 2014, I'm bored, so I take the disc out, slide it into the wii, and decide it's time. I get my laptop out, and decides to search the zelda forums. Bingo. Someone with the same conundrum as me and several others. Why didn't I think of this before?

There. A list of most commonly missed hiding places. I go down, one by one. Like magic, it turns out I missed one under a gravestone in Kakariko village. I'm fucking stoked. I'm practically pumped at this point. Down I go the list... Bing bang boom, would ya believe I found the last poe too. In the same day! It was hanging around in the icy mountains. It felt so good ripping that motherfucker's soul out. I collapsed with my arms splayed on the sofa, staring gleefully at the ceiling.

Completionist bliss. Never give up, m8."
