117900,"Twilight Princess was my 1st ever T rated game I ever played, and I loved playing it, made me feel awesome doing the hidden techniques to finish off or start attacks. There is also the best companion ever, Midna! So yeah, bit of nostalgia in my eyes, and though it may not be labeled as the ""best"" Zelda game, it was, and still is, great!  "
