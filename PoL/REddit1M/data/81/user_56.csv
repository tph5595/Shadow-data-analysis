16845,"i agree with everything you just said. except that i didn't enjoy the combat at all, but that's definitely because i only played the wii version. and the controls in the wii version were just god-awful."
17048,"see, that's the problem. they rushed the wii port of the game instead of just waiting for SS for a wii title, and the fallout includes the wii controls being unforgivably terrible. i never had an opportunity to play the gamecube one, because they didn't make a whole lot of copies, so now a GC copy is crazy expensive. because i only played the wii version, this is my least favorite zelda game"
17877,"I hated it. now, that's mostly because i never got a chance to play the gamecube one, and the wii controls were virtually unusable, but that's not it. i didn't like the art style. a lot of people praise TP for it's gritty, realistic art style. but that's not LoZ. the games have always had somewhat dark concepts and content, balanced out with the cartoony, light hearted art style. in TP, i just felt uncomfortable most of the time. aside from that, the story was disjointed and honestly just not very good, the side missions and collections felt tacked on, the transistions between normal and twilight were needlessly abrupt and threw a kink into the flow of the game. and i think we should stop writing off and ignoring the terrible wolf dynamic, also very tacked on. and, the blowing through grass instead of having an actual instrument pissed me off more than it necessarily should. overall, i think people praise this game for it's massive scale, somewhat interesting items (which are cool at first, but quickly become novelty as you realize that very few of them have any unscripted use), and for it's dark, gritty tone, and they ignore all of the glaring problems with the basic game design.

tl;dr i think it's the worst zelda game for the important reasons, and is praised for stupid reasons. it's a more compelling argument if you read it all."
20036,"really? they were terrible. of course they were. they were thrown together at the last minute just so they could have a competing wii title. it was only supposed to be on gamecube, so the game wasn't built around the wii control scheme, which is very different. it was built to be a push button game, suddenly shoved onto a motion control platform."
31550,"ah, and here is why SS got that one really terrible review that ruined it's reputation right off the bat. in TP, there was no point to the motion control. twitching the remote, in essence, just pressed the b button, except with a lower success rate than a button. and the aiming just moved the curser like a joystick, it didn't actually point. the reason, of course, is because that's exactly what was happening. it wasn't motion controls, it was a button controller mapped to specific motions. which is fine. the problem came when SS came out with it's actually functional full motion controls, which were brilliantly done, and people couldn't adjust. people expected the twitch=button format, and got confused when they got motion control instead. anyone who says the controls are better in TP than SS obviously didn't understand how they worked, and probably suck at video games."
31876,"it's fine in concept, but half the time it didn't register the swing, at least for me, and at that point, why is it not just a button? a button is a lot more likely to behave correctly. it's a problem on the console end and not the game design end, but it's still a problem."
110981,"i can understand all of that, but i'm very surprised by it. i had virtually no problem getting SS controls to do what i wanted. you don't need to do full swings, you just need small, precise movements. lots of jerking motions help with the motion recognition. when i said ""suck at video games"" i guess what i meant was ""are the kind of gamers that don't bother to carefully read the on screen instructions."" because so many of the problems people have with the controls, including you, evidently, can be easily resolved by carefully following directions. it's a new format for a game, so of course you need to read the instructions. as for the flying, i literally loved it instantly, so i have no idea what you mean. i thought it was incredibly intuitive, and doing the flying with a motion of my hand sucked me so much more into the game. with every other game, i find myself, for example, hopping on epona and pointing myself in the right direction, then disengage from the game and look around, check my phone, whatever. not so with SS. the entire game requires you to be fully involved to a degree that no other game does. the gyro control portions were some of my favorite parts. like the fun fun island game. idk, i guess we're just very different gamers, but i loved the challenge and immersion throughout the game, and i loved how it kept surprising me with the mechanics and how they interacted with the controls."
