It was clear that people would come around to loving Wind Waker after the knee jerk negative reaction, but Nintendo wanted instant gratification so they just made Ocarina 2. Plus, there are a lot of boring sections of the game. Wolf form, fighting the rasta zombies over and over, collecting the droplets.... 

It just doesn't feel like a game that only Nintendo could make. It's just a solid game."
