0,"And it still feels like it was only yesterday. Looking back on it now after many years and a few Zelda releases since how do you feel about TP?

I assume we all remember the insane hype, the endless delays and the 4 year gap between Wind Waker and Twilight Princess. The announcement that it would be ported to the Wii(and flipped!) and the GC version delayed.(Ah those early Wii days) 

Looking back how do you think TP faired? Does it hold up as an OoT? Or does it flop like an AoL? What legacy did the game leave on us and the series as a whole? What are some of your fondest memories? Will we ever see TP Link, Zelda and Midna again? Who knows."

Three main things really, most of which can be blamed on the Wii's poor hardware.

1. Hyrule field and it's tiny little sections. I'd rather have had a single large field like in OoT than the tiny pieces we get in the game, they obviously wanted to do that(As TP Hyrule is practically OoT Hyrule) but the most likely reason they didn't is because it would have been too much for the GC and Wii to load at once. sigh.

2. Lake Hylia, it didn't really feel too much like a lake in this game. Due to the high walls surrounding it and the stupid shit you have to go through to exit it without warping it felt less like a lake and more like a crater. Not really connected to the rest of the world byt rather cut off and isolated.

3. Gerudo Desert, WAAAAAY too small and under-developed. Could have really been something great but felt extremely small and empty. Nothing really in it and only really has 2 areas and the dungeon. Not cool."
42297,If you want a Zelda like game play Dark Souls. It's like someone took the style of the original LoZ and dragged it into the modern era.
