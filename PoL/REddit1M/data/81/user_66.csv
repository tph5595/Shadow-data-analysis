19400,"I don't think it was terrible, but I was caught by overhype, particularly from those early trailers...

I wasn't a fan of the more sci-fi-ish/squarey designs of the invading Twili. Zant was an awesome bad guy and then... well, it was anti-climactic. To me, the game felt like a shadow of the heart of earlier games in the series, particularly Wind Waker and Ocarina of Time. It didn't evoke as much emotion from me. It felt empty, not as mythic or magical.

There were good parts. Midna was great, especially Midna's Lament and the ending. I liked being a wolf. Fighting felt awesome, especially with the hidden sword skills. The Arbiter's Grounds and Snowpeak Ruins stand out to me as some of the better dungeons in Zelda. Riding around Hyrule Fields like a boss, slaying the goblin riders... epic.

But I dunno, the game felt like it was missing something.

That being said? I think it would be awesome to have a similar art style in HD. And build on those same sword combat mechanics. It would be great to have a world as big as TP gave us, though with some more life, more places to explore."
