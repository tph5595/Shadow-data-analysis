29081,It shall always be remembered as one of the most mediocre Zelda games. 
34509,The reason being its mediocrity. 
36801,"No you see, it totally is. As a Zelda game at least. TP would be amazing if it weren't a Zelda game. Its mythos feels so alien to the rest of the series and the story would actually benefit from being original and not having to involve Zelda elements. As a non-Zelda game it's a GREAT game. But as a Zelda game, it's just a mediocre Zelda game. Ugh."
37579,"Not really. One of the weakest aspects of Zelda is how nonsensical the canon gets when you try to connect every single game in one (two, three) timeline (s). TP's is one of the more skewed Zelda games it barely feels like one. 

And this is not even the reason why TP, as a Zelda game, is so mediocre.
