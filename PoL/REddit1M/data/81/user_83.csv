21728,"I'm going to be that one guy and say I thought it was extremely forgettable. It felt too same-y from OoT/WW with the twilight/wolf stuff as just a tacked on gimmick (and playing the Wiimote version, that's a damn statement). The story was ho-hum, self-contained and didn't further the lore at all. I'm in the process of giving it another go, in Dolphin, with GC controls rather than the Wiimote, because how everyone looks back on it I know it deserves a second chance. As it stands, however, Skyward Sword is where it's at for me."
