16169,"Twilight Princess is a masterpiece. It remains my all-time favorite of the series. That statement isn't meant to devalue the other games, as most are incredible in their own right. But TP incorporated so many of the best elements of the others. The Song of Healing from Majora's Mask is the first wolf song you have to perform. The idea of double clawshots was amazing. The fact that you could cut grass *while running* is something I wish they'd kept. And the feeling of the sheer vastness of the world was incredible.

On that last point, I remember playing Ocarina of Time when it came out and being awed by it. It was the first 3D Zelda, there was nothing else like it, and it was amazing. But at the same time, it still felt a bit small, even to my young mind. Twilight Princess' landscape, on the other hand, is enormous. And not artificially enormous like Wind Waker's (because let's be honest; all that ocean is really just boring whitespace), but genuinely huge. Lake Hylia actually feels like a lake, not just a shallow pond like in OoT.

With all that said, of all the Zelda games, I was least satisfied with the soundtrack in Twilight Princess. Midna's Lament is one of the few redeeming songs from that game, along with the Gerudo Desert music (which still pales in comparison to the original Gerudo Valley music). That's really the only demerit points I have for Twilight Princess... they could have done the soundtrack better. But when it comes to gameplay, story, and general experience, that game just blows me away."
