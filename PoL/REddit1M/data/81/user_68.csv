Still play it every now and then(got backlogs doe).

Never gonna forget the one game so far where I can 
say with confidence that I feel that Link is more pragmatic than
honor bound, if you will; sure, he's still fighting for the greater
good, but this is the sort of story where the protagonist
might very well have to do BAD stuff.

And, with how this Link was portrayed, he'd do some pretty (un)ambiguously bad things without a second thought if it meant that things work out for the better of Hyrule overall when it's over.

I can understand why fans who write about the post-game often depict him as deeply conflicted/shell-shocked/more of a ""designated"" hero than he might be thought of by those he saved.

I mean, sure, other Links off enemies without looking back, but nearly *none* of them have anything to do of that sort with humans besides Ganondorf.

Uh, I ranted here, so I'll sum it up. 
tl;dr 1. TP is godlike. 2. ask ""What measure is another human if they are your foe?"" non-TP Links(on paper or something, silence yes): ""Someone to try to talk out of that."" TP Link: ""Dead.""
Think about it lol"
