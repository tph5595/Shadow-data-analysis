7700,"Everyone I talk to seems to remember TP in a negative light (pun intended) because of the wolf sections, but after replaying TP a couple years ago, I was surprised by how great it was. TP has some of the most epic Zelda moments to date, including the Hyrule field battle where King Bulbin comes over a side of the ridge followed by an ARMY all on mounts. The bridge of Eldin battles. The colossal bosses (and mini-bosses). The chill that comes up your spine the first time you see Zant (before they completely ruin him at the end), the heartbreaking moment where Midna is DYING on your back. Twilight was heavy, guys, and in my opinion hugely underrated because of a couple tedious parts. Do yourself a favor and go through it again. Here's to hoping we get a Zelda like that again. I'd take that over a million Skyward Sword's anyday. "
