26374,"I played it on Gamecube and remember being diasppointed when I bought it off Amazon and it came with an instruction manual in noric languages. The game was fine but I couldn't read the manual. I was 21 at the time but it still left me feeling a little glum. I've read every other manual through from cover to cover, but not TP. I could get a PDF I'm sure, but it's just not the same.

I thought it was a fantastic game, but my only gripe was that they built this huge world that just felt empty. There were three Hylian settlements, and then the Zoras and the Gorons. The world felt desolate."
