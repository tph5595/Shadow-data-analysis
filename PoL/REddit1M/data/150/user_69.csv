51815,It would create all sorts of weirdness if you were jumping back and forth between the exact same two points in time. Basically every time you'd move forward or backward you'd enter a room full of Links that had just spontaneously come into existence in this exact same spot and then they'd all run off to different corners of the earth to solve all the world's problems at once. It'd only get more present an entirely different set of weirdness if there was only one body so that when you went back or forward your doing something during this time period means the things you previously did during this same time period now go undone.
