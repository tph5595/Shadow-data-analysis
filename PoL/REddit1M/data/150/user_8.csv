38006,"Good idea, but it has a few potential problems: You start MM with no items except the sword &amp; shield, and 3 hearts. Just like any Zelda game, excluding the sword &amp; shield. That wasn't really a problem in the original MM, but if it requires the player to beat OoT first, the game will either have to take away all heart containers (certain to piss off the player), or have a maximum of 37, 17 of which have potential to become permanently unattainable (certain to piss off the player). Nintendo would also have to find a way to take away all the player's items (easy enough), learned songs (somewhat more difficult), and somehow work into the storyline that Link got a different shield. Nintendo is clever, though. They'd find a solution to this if they wanted to. Even I did as I was typing that."
298960,"That could actually work, but I had another idea about the songs and items. Songs from both games will be stored on the same subscreen. Link uses the warp songs from OoT to go back to Hyrule, and the song of soaring to re-enter Termina. Items from Hyrule (other than the ocarina) don't exist in Termina, and vice versa. Heart containers? Just have less of them, hidden in all-new locations. Also, if Link leaves Termina, it'll be Dawn of the first day when he returns. Saving the game works as it did in OoT. Any potential problems here, other than the songs that were in both games?"
