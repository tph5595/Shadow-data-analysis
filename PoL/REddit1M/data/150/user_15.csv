It blew my mind almost as hard as when I discovered the tower on Lon Lon Ranch in 2010."
12244,I was not aware that he disappeared after you take the Master Sword.

LINK: ""You know, Ganondorf. I can't believe you snuck into the Temple of Time like that. Where were you hiding?""

GANONDORF: ""Oh, haha. Behind the Sheikah Stones out front.""

LINK: ""BRB"""

Make one game: Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask in one linear adventure, put together. The entire experience is called Ocarina of Time.

It uses [these graphics](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PqdwT2pKYzY), has fully orchestrated music, and expert voice acting. Link remains silent.

THE END."

Here's an upvote. Sorry for Reddit. There can be great information on the Web site, but the community is garbage."

(2) The game could incorporate the initial Deku Scrub curse with all your hearts being taken away.

(3) The shield is different because you are in an alternate dimension. The game would let you keep the OOT shield and sword until the transition between worlds.

Still thinking about the learned songs. I think it could work. I would go back to explaining it with the dimensional shift, but I'm sure someone could think of something."
306343,"I see you have a mesh, intermingle idea of sort of overlaying the games. I was thinking more of a linear setup: (1) beat OOT (2) beat MM

But yeah, seriously ... Nintendo has to try something with these games."
