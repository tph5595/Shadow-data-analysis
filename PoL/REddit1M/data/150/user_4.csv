4862,Sorry you're downvoted because I was thinking the exact same thing. The point of the game is to beat Ganon. Most of us didn't even come across the castle guard on our first play through.

You played and beat Ganon not because of an NPC, you did it because that was the fucking thing to do. Like, what else were you supposed to do? Wander around? Sure you can fuck around a bit and sell masks, but eventually you got to get a move on."
