15138,I love his mario mask
15323,"a lot of it is when you go back and look at it. It's just that this one was right in front of you. Ganondorf poisons the great deku tree, tries to kill the gorons (twice, the fucker), releases the evil spirits from the forest temple ( what was the forest temple before?) also releases spirits from the shadow temple, which appears to have been a massive torture prison. Really he fucks everyone over except the Zoras. oh, i guess he freezes them or something. "
15475,"but wouldn't have ganondorf collected the spiritual stones if link didn't? that's why he poisoned the tree, woke up the dodongo, and... well the zoras fucked themselves over really. But he would've been back after the deku tree died, and once all the gorons were dead. Then he would've taken out the zoras. Why he didn't get the retarded fishfaces first is beyond me, maybe he can't swim."
15629,i think the unknown soldier not being found right away has some meaning...
17834,"yes, that does make sense, but how powerful was ganondorf before he got a hold of the triforce? I don't recall seeing him with an army. I always assumed since the shit he did was so backhanded, he didn't want to attract any attention because he wouldn't be able to defend himself. So instead, he was like an assassin, just hitting a few key points to get what he wanted rather than a full frontal assault. Once he got the triforce, well his third at least, he took over the kingdom because no one could stop him. "
26877,"that's true, but his army must either be the same or weaker than the hylian army. Maybe it's due to experience the hylian army gained from the Hyrulian Civil war before OoT? If ganondorf was strong enough, he would've stormed in with an army to start. He needed the triforce to actually be able to take over, which Link helped him get, but if Link didn't open the door of time, ganondorf would've still gotten a hold of it. 
It sorta plays off of the Hero's Journey idea. Hero causes a problem that he must fix, makes it hit a lot closer than fixing someone elses mistakes


And Ganondorf is a great wizard, like gandalf! when he dies, he just comes back in the next game!"
