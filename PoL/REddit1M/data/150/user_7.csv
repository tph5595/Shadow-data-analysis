5603,Shows up after you return to the castle after getting the third stone; after Ganondorf confronts you while chasing after Zelda and Impa. From that time until you pick up the master sword he's there.

Going through the Door of Time assists Ganondorf in getting to the Triforce. It's the state that Zelda sends you back to at the end of the game; technically your whole adulthood is a mistake.  
  
Knowing what you know, don't go through the Door of Time. Just hang out somewhere until Hylian guards capture Ganondorf and kill him as per normal."
