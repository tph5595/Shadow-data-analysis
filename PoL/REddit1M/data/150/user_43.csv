23795,"But [in the credits you are sent back to the room with the master sword](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=InkKkTcw9_A#t=307s), i.e. the door of time has already been opened or you would have been stuck in there for the rest of your life unable to get out of that room.

P.S. I am one of those weirdos that think the Hyrule Historia timeline is a load of BS (and NOT canon) to please fans and that it really doesn't make any sense."
33861,A shame that /u/SonicFlash01 was wrong based on the evidence I presented or a shame that you have nothing to say about it?
35470,"Well, all I can tell you is that the door has been opened. In the video I linked, it is clearly visible. It seems the game designers left some interesting plot holes at the end. It really doesn't make sense any way you try to explain it because the information is self-contradictory.

Fact: Zelda gave the ocarina of time to Link while escaping the castle, so she is no longer there.  
Fact: The ocarina of time is needed to open the door of time.  
Fact: The door of time has been opened when Link returns to the past.  
Fact: Zelda is in the courtyard when Link returns to the past.  

It don't make no sense, y'all. I think that it is important to realize that there isn't some clear solution that makes the discrepancies go away, even if the solution is from Nintendo."
59750,A shame that you just swallow whatever you're told without asking what it is first.
59883,"He didn't put the sword back in. It was already there. I linked to the right spot in the credits video. You should check it out.

Anyways, if this is before Ganondorf chased her out of the castle, then the door of time cannot be open because the ocarina of time is needed to open them and Link didn't have the ocarina of time yet. The problem is that the door IS open, as viewable in the credits."
126823,People are allowed to have opinions that don't match yours and it isn't a shame. It is just narrow-minded and sad to think that your opinion is the only one that exists and to judge others who disagree. I try to be a critical thinker and make my own decisions based on the information. I also try not to resort to insults.
