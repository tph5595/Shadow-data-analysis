15899,"Does anyone know, Is MM actually coming to WiiU? I need to know this, My 64 was stolen back in the day, so I never got to play that one. So if MM is being re-released it has sealed the deal on a WiiU purchase. I think I am going to pull the trigger anyway, but this will make it definite.

Edit: After looking, I guess it's fake. Too bad for me. And fuck you to whoever felt the need to down vote my hope. Assbag."

No big deal really. It was the fact that I asked a simple polite question and, yeah whatever. I honestly dont care about karma. I wish we could get rid of it entirely."

I might have to look for that collectors edition. I still have my Cube and Wii. Thanks again.

28208,"No, not really. Just renting a house w some frineds. Come home from work one day, back door kicked in, bunch of stuff missing, fingerprint dust all over the place. The real pisser was, I was right at the end of OoT, trying to kill Ganondorf, and boom gone :( It took me years to get to finish that one, and I never did get to play MM. And everyone loves MM. That trailer was pretty well made, so I hoped for a second they might actually rer-elease. There are other ways to play it. I'll get to it eventually."
