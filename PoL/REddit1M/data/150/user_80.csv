65298,"While playing the game it would always break my heart that the adulthood phase seemed completely irrelevant since you would never be able to experience your (Link's) success.  Such a lonely realization that even if you succeeded, you would be a child again with no one else to remember your adventures.  And oh the adventures!  They never happened.  All of the historical temples explored and friends made, all having never happened.  Partially a reason why I could never bring myself to play majora's mask, since it basically repeats this formula over and over again.  Anyways, that's all.  OoT makes me sad sometimes.  It's a surprisingly lonely game!"
