If you have a Wii or a Gamecube, you can still find the Collector's Edition with Ocarina of Time, Majora's Mask, and Zelda I and II.  It takes a bit of searching (and a bit of money) but it's got all those in one."

Good luck!  I was able to find one on eBay for relatively cheap.  I have Majora's Mask on N64, but I am a collector of things Zelda, so for completion's sake I needed to have the Collector's Edition as well."
