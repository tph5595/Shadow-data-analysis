25723,"But then Link wouldn't have left the forest and met the happy mask salesman, and introduced the Skull Kid to the skull mask. So Skull Kid would be less interested in masks in general and never have stolen Majora's mask in the first place!"
62007,"&gt;You're argument is invalid.

My are argument is only invalid if you accept that the way *you* played Ocarina of Time is canonical in Majora's Mask. Majora's Mask is a separate game, and so it has to have chosen a specific set of actions taken in Ocarina of Time to be canon, remain vague in those areas, or simply choose to not tie into OoT's canon at all. The developer's chose to remain vague, so there's no way to say for certain that my supposition is incorrect.

*However*, don't think this open nature dismisses everything! Do you really think the developers chose the Skull Kid for no particular reason? Do you think they would have chosen one of the other Skull Kids, who were always in a *group*, as the character who most strongly struggles with loneliness? Do you think the MASK theme has nothing to do with the masks as they were used in Ocarina of Time? How about the fact that the Skull Kid wants the mask so that he can appear a ""bit tougher""? Or how about that he's mischievous enough to take the mask without paying full price?

So there's this Skull Kid found in the Lost Woods, who is alone, associates masks with power, is well known for his mischievous nature, has a tendency to steal masks he wants, but you're saying developers chose him at random, completely unrelated to the themes touched upon in the previous game, and that he's definitely not the same as the Skull Kid who is first seen in the Lost Woods, who is lonely, wants a powerful mask, is well known for his mischievous behavior, enough so that he steals a mask? And we're just supposed to accept that these are two separate characters?

Of course this is all moot, because not only does Skull Kid give a reaction implying he remembers having met Link before when he first sees him in MM, but he confirms that he's the same Skull Kid when he tells Link at the end of MM that he has the same scent as the fairy kid who teaches him a song in the forest. And when you encounter Skull Kid in the forest in OoT, you, in the appearance of a fairy kid, have to *play Saria's Song for him before he will befriend you*.

Edit: I had no idea I felt so strongly about this."
