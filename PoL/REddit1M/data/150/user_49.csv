You may try to avoid actual insults, but that doesn't mean you don't insult people regardless. Though, and you'll have to permit me to assume something here as well, I'm pretty sure you already knew that. If not, well, that's pretty gosh darn sad that you don't realize what obvious sarcasm or joke is. One might even say its a shame."
