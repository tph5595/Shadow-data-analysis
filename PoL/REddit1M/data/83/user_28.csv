14526,"Do you still need more hearts to stay alive in this game? I dont get why thats bothering people. End game your already invincible with so many hearts, fairys, super food, -a certain skill- , upgrades overpowered outfits and weapons. :/"
14699,"Why do you want more hearts? Dont you feel overpowered already?
(Just asking)"
16624,"You can have 30 hearts and a Lynel still nearly kills you in a few strikes endgame? Your doing something terribly wrong then xD

You can always pause the game and eat tons of food if you cant manage to get a hang of the Lynel fight. "

21161,But you are able to complete the current game 100% right? Did you?
21881,"The solution of dealing with high damage enemies is not to keep giving the player more and more health (if you want that you can always eat food). There should be a limit. A good balance of how much is right. (If you ask me, 20 hearts should have been the max with all the hp regenerating stuff)
There should be at least some challenge right, to make the game challenging and fun?
Or are you totally being wrecked? Cause I cant imagine that. :/
You can basically avoid every move of a Lynel if you practice. "
22354,Hehe great problem solved :D
53167,I have an idea: turn in hearts until you have 15 left = 1 row of hearts. :D
