15416,6? More like 1-2
15476,How does having it powered all the time help? Won't it still break if used against anything but guardians? At least that's the case for me
15515,And a Lynel hit still takes almost all my hearts wearing a maxed barbarian armor set 
15743,"For reference, I'm a disabled military veteran. I literally, LITERALLY only play video games or whatever I'd like. I put in soo many hours into this game and am still trying to the last few shrines but 300k rupees and all 900 seeds is unreal. Actually, just the 900 seeds is unreal. I'm at about 250ish and the game is beat and nearly all map has been traversed and I could not imagine scouring for these since some are actually well hidden. Luckily the dlc will help but good gods this seems like a long time without a map of all the korok seeds already "
18049,"I know that, but that doesn't mean they don't deal a lot of damage. They do, especially with their power moves. Maxed barbarian armor, and max hearts "
18849,So my original comment still stands haha
22264,Nononono I can totally kill lynels and anything else in the game. Just saying that if I get hit though while wearing that it'll still hurt. If I wear my Knight armor (maxed) it won't hurt practically at all
