27004,oh man can I ever attest to that! just last night I faced my first talus where the weak node was on its back and it was such a pain to make contact with it. adding insult to injury it was also the first frost talus I'd faced and I didn't have the unfreezable bonus yet. I kept getting frozen every couple seconds. that fight sucked and encouraged me to unlock unfreezable and to probably avoid any other talus that has the weak node on its back from here on out.

and also keep hoping for ones where the node is on top. plenty of room to stand up there!"
