31976,"I just maxed out my inventory upgrades and still have about 450 Koroks to go... I was giving serious consideration to using a map for the remaining ones, that is until we got the deets on the DLC1. But I'm with you ... I'm not sure I can wait another 1-3 months to finish 'em off. I might just give in and then use the mask on my 2nd and subsequent playthroughs (and only to get the first 450 because I have no desire to 100% the game more than once :D)"
32141,"It does. I've lately been using it for guardians and blights only, and I'm getting way more hits out of it than when I was using it to fight regular tough enemies or mini-bosses. I would guess it doubles durability along with doubling the attack power."
32451,"It's not really about needing more hearts to survive, it's more about the symmetry of seeing two full rows, both on the game screen and on the loading screens. Having 3 hearts missing, or 3/5 of one of the stamina wheels missing is just annoying to look at."
86574,"I think it's just slightly less than 450, once I had them finished I still had a few seeds left over. I had weapons and bows maxed out around 360ish seeds, and all but 5 shield slots. Those last 5 were 15, 15, 15, 15, and 20."
87403,"Pretty sure that doesn't work that way. You're exchanging hearts for stamina, or vice versa, not just relinquishing them with nothing in exchange.

It would only work for 10 hearts maximum, assuming you've not taken any stamina upgrades. Leaving you with 17 hearts, 15 stamina (if we assume the first wheel is 5 like the other two) and 40 more shrines to go."
