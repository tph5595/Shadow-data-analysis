41551,3 hours a day is not nothing with a job/kid/wife/house
41625,"Completely agree. 3 hours a day may not be a whole lot of time for some people, but it definitely isn't a scarcity."
43015,"I am not doubting that it would be easy to hit 3 hours a day even with a kid and a job, just the point that 3 hours a day is nothing/not a lot of time. That's a good chunk of time."
73513,"I guess we have to agree to disagree. This is all purely subjective. 3 hours for me is a lot of time and not something I can do because of job/kid/wife/house and other obligations. When I was back in college or highschool, I'd probably agree with you that 3 hours was nothing."
