2. Talus: you can kill them in seconds without taking a hit and they drop lots of gems"
4441,"climb and charge attack with a powerful two-hand weapon, like the stone smasher (you can find one behind a metal bookcase at the library in hyrule castle). for farming, prefer the ones that have the node on top; avoid the ones with the node on their backs, they are a pain to kill."
4494,i hope the dlc fixes that
14196,"well, they said ""new dungeon"""
25746,"indeed, when your time is very limited, you can either take a few shortcuts or not do everything you would like to.

i'd classify my guide usage as ""light"". as a general rule of thumb, after i'm stuck for 10 min, i look what the next step is (but only the *next* step). because, for me, it is either ""i can be stuck for the next 30 min"" or ""i can play for the next 30 min"". when you have a daughter to take to daycare and a train to catch to work the next morning, it makes all the difference.

i used a map for the last 750 koroks."
29149,"but then you have to wait, what?, 20min for it to recharge? i have no 20 min to spare :-) normally, i only use urborsa's for lynels."
31283,"yes, but usually it will take all 3 to shoot down a talus."
36710,"i used a map for the last 750 koroks. but don't think the map makes it ""easy"" or ""boring""; the map makes it ""possible"". it is still very challenging and fun to find them all, even when you know where they are supposed to be."
36943,they said the 2nd dlc comes with a new dungeon
37264,"999 arrows, 200 ancient, about 800 shock and between 200-300 the others"
37357,some koroks can be very though wihout a map. who is going to climb every single tree in the game?
37420,light guide usage and a map for the last 750 koroks.
