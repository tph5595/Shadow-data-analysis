35441,"Well, you can't play forever.  But my kids (4yo and 1yo) go to bed around 8:30, so I can get a few hours in before I'm too tired.

And.... yeah.  Soon after the game came out, I did spend a few nights up later than I should have been.  Those were mistakes.  (Honestly what helped was the WiiU tablet running out of juice)"
