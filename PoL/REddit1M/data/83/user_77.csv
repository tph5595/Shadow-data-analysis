31644,"I call bullshit.  Anyone who 100% a game like this in two months has plenty of free time.  I'd say I spent 60 hours for 40 shrines and maybe 50 Korok seeds and very little screwing around before I beat the game. Multiply that by 3 you're looking at 180 hours to 100% it minimum.  It's been exactly two months. 180hrs/60 days is 3 hours a day.  That's 3 hours a day average.  That's not a ""premium"" on free time."
