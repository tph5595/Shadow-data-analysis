All it would take is half an hour in the morning, maybe a little during lunch break, a little while waiting in the car to pick up his kid from daycare, it all adds up super quick.

It's also an average. All it takes is a weekend day where you play more than usual and suddenly that average jumps up by a significant margin.

If it's something you care about, it's incredibly easy to reach a 3 hour/day average without even trying - and it's not like you have to maintain it for years, most people will be done with a single player game within a couple of months then it's back to normal.

Hell, you could even spend a full 10-11 hours playing on a Sunday and that still leaves 6-7 hours in that day for other obligations, depending on how much you sleep. Now you only need to spend close to an hour and a half a day playing for the rest of the week to maintain that 3 hour average."
