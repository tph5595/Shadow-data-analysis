Also some lynels have terrifying clubs (78 damage/108 with damage bonus). If you don't die taking them on, they're awesome for Taluses. Combine with attack potion/barbarian gear for ultimate carnage.

For regular taluses, I climb their back (don't climb the front, they'll fall forwards and crush you), hold the lock button, hit twice, and the talus is dead. I haven't really taken on any other taluseseses with it, but presumably it'll be a similar outcome.

For me, that wasting time is the actual game, but to each their own."
22195,Right? Even if I find I've just spent 30 minutes trying to take the perfect picture of a crow.

I was excited when they announced the Korok hat in the DLC, although I suspect I will have succumbed to a guide by then. I can't imagine find all 900 by hand."

And yeah, I figure I'll do a hard playthrough at some point, so maybe I'll use the Korok hat there. I might stop at max inventory on this playthrough, and do 100% on the next one.
