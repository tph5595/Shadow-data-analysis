41647,"This really would be the best approach. If they're making a TV series out of Zelda, then they're not going to be able to translate all of the things that make Zelda feel like Zelda (puzzles are a big one). 

Meanwhile, there are many things in the lore that are unexplored or unexplained such as the Imprisoning War, the war between Demise and Hylia, the banishment of the Twili, the making of Majora's Mask, etc. 

Since most of these events wouldn't necessarily make for a great Zelda game because they'd be more war focused and story-driven, why not use the TV show, a story-driven medium, to go into depth of those events? Plus, if it's just some random story (the imprisoning of a god in a mask for instance), then the general public can get into it."
41871,"iirc, the only Zelda game that doesn't feature Zelda in some capacity is A Link's Awakening. You could possibly argue Phantom Hourglass..."
42847,"I mean more so because PH features Tetra but in her Pirate form, not her Princess Zelda form. She takes on the role of Tetra not Zelda, so in a sense, Zelda isn't in the game."
