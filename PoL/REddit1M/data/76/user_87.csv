I think WW would be the best game to try and turn into a series, since it involves having people help him out in dungeons. So while they're trying to solve a puzzle, they could be arguing about how best to get it done, but Link will always be interrupted by either the ally or a fairy. "

I didn't know there was a emulator for it, I only knew of the N64 one. "
