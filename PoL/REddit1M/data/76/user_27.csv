There is a reason that in the past games make poor movies and movies make poor games. 

I could potentially see this working if they focus more on the people living in Hyrule, dealing with the effects of what happens in the games, or maybe what happens between games. In any case, it can't just focus on link, otherwise, I'm afraid we're going to watching a live-action let's-play of OoT or something. "
20521,"True. What I'm trying to get across is that you are trying to figure things out. You're solving puzzles, so the player is actively engaged. It advance the plot, they have to figure things out. A movie or TV show isn't like that at all, and so the point of the zelda series is kinda lost. They'll have to find other ways to make it interesting. "

It should cut back to Zelda and maybe some political issues in the castle, maybe some distrust of the loyalty of Ganondorf to the king (if it follows OoT). Maybe the day to day life of the townspeople and how ti changes, etc. Side stories about Malon and her father, and their life on the ranch. Idk, just thinking out loud. Point is, it needs to follow more than just Link's journey. "
