10552,I think they should ignore Link or just keep him in the background. I think focusing on characters that do have a personality and the results of Link's intervention on Hyrule would be really interesting to see. It also maintains Link's integrity as a blank slate for the gameplayer.
25872,None in the sense that giving him any dialogue could drastically change anyone's perspective on him.
