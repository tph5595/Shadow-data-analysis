81705,"Honestly, I would be fine with them making Link talk, but keeping him the silent rogue type.  Like when he does talk it's for a specific purpose but for the most part he conveys his feelings with attitude/expressions/grunts/action yells.

That way he represents the silent Link, but isn't awkward by NEVER talking, like he's mute or something.  "
86914,"Hah, I agree.  Honestly I think it'd be fine if they change his character a bit, a darker, grittier version of Link would be interesting.  

I mean, there's so much you can do with the series because every incarnation of Link is slightly different.  "
