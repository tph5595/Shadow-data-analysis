15943,Bro did you even raise the water level and go beneath the floor in the central tower?
15995,That shadow over death mountain looks serious!
16083,"As a fan of zelda maybe i should feel bad, but what is Imprisoning War?

E: My credentials: first game was LoZ NES (my bro helped me beat, i was 5), LttP, LA, OoT, MM, MC, TP, WW, SS"
18174,Oh okay that was ww or tp storyline right? Ive only played them once as i borrowed my brothers gamecube

Be sure to explore all parts of the room where you reunite with Ruto at different water levels. The compass helps, you'll need keys. Other than that, it's pretty straightforward. It kinda sucks because it does take a while to get through, but like I say if you pay attention to your surroundings and what rooms youve entered, then it aint so bad.


E: DON'T DO IT DRUNK! I tried that a couple weeks ago. Wasn't fun. Took me just about two and a half hours, and that's with multiple replays in my memory. I'm glad i was patient drunk and not frustrated drunk. "
56669,That's pretty cool. I really need to pick up Hyrule Historia

I remember playing Silent Hill with him when it came out. We got stuck on a piano puzzle. This was before internet was widespread. We racked our brains trying to figure it out. Finally we said screw it. We went to bed. He woke me up the next morning and said ""wake up man i think i figured it out.""

So we go turn on the PlayStation and lo and behold he solves it immediately. That's how I learned the value of a good night's sleep."
