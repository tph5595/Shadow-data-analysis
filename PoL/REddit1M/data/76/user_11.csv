If you stray too far from the source material, it gets shit listed by the fan boys, and it gets pulled.  Let's be real here.  Is there really anyway this ends with everyone happy?"
17956,"I disagree.  I think there's plenty of lore and backstory, but you're right.  They do a great job of introducing new things, and then doing the massive throwback to the old days.    Wind Waker would be a good example, I think."
18245,"That's an interesting concept, but something easy to reroute.  Like in Wind Waker, it's tradition for every boy of a certain age to wear his clothes to honor him, etc. Etc.  Why not a random kid who does that who can, you know, talk?  

Or just go with minimal dialogue from the main character. "
18422,"Then it'd have to be a series like American Horror Story, where each season in like starting over from scratch.  Or Final Fantasy, where no two games follow each other.  (direct sequels aside)."
18563,"Putting one line in as a disclaimer seems like a cop out.  Basically saying, "" We took some creative liberties with this.  You'll get over it."""
86493,"If they actually made the character medically mute, I'd be more upset than lettung him talk a little."
