As far as lore goes, any amount would be fine as long as it's not expected the viewer has any knowledge of Zelda at all.  There's a lot to Lord of the Rings, but the average person can watch the first film and understand everything, and the people who already know a lot of Lord of the Rings don't need it catered to them, etc.

I think my biggest worry is design choices.  I hope it has a distinct visual style that sets it apart from other shows but doesn't go too much into the realm of silliness, like the games.  People like Tingle can appear for example, but the overall mood shouldn't be influenced a lot by that."

Especially one part in Skyward Sword where he's asked what happened and he starts explaining with his hands and mouth movements but the camera is distant and fading.  I wish people didn't care so much about his voice.  I'm pretty sure the same people care so much about the Warden's voice in Dragon Age that he will probably never make an appearance in any future titles despite him being someone I would like to see reappear the most, especially as a playable character, because the developers don't want to offend anyone.

Sorry for the tangent.  That stuff is so arbitrary and over-analyzed which unfortunately has a huge influence on creators, which can really take a toll on everyone else's experience.  I don't want to watch a show with a silent protagonist when it's unnecessary or contributing to nothing, I also don't want to watch a show based on a universe in which the main protagonist in the source material is missing.  If they can pull off a mute character well, then I suppose more power to them, but I honestly don't believe that's something manageable, especially for the main protagonist in this genre, or something that interesting. 

If they do decide to that, it better add to his character development.  Since it would be a major character flaw, it should have a large effect on what happens with the character, rather than something just to appease people, much in the way a protagonist with amnesia would have issues and play a large part in the character's choices and character and story development.  I'm sure we could suppose, for example, that there is no sign language in this universe, mutes are very rare, perhaps discarded/outcast, and Link being a mute with such huge responsibility and no simple capability of communication would have a large impact on how the story goes.  Perhaps an interesting twist, but do you really want to watch someone struggling with communication when you want to watch a live action Zelda?

I would rather have someone with an annoying voice who can act and play a character with good development, but apparently people would rather hamper that to get some satisfaction out of something meaningless."
