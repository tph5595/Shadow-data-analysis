11124,"Here is an idea: remember the old woman from major's mask? the one that puts you to sleep? The show should open with her telling a child a story. The Legend of Zelda. Since the woman is old it should be mentioned that she doesn't recall the tale perfectly thereby giving the story some room to breath while still being a part of the larger whole.

At the start of each season the old woman wakes the boy up and recaps the last season."
23058,"Instead of ""mentioned"" I ought to have written ""implied"". I see no reason it couldn't be done subtly. [unreliable narrator] etc etc. 

Is it still a cop out? Yeah, but imagine the flexibility. If the story can get away with not explaining itself into the timeline it will be better for it. Let the story feel a bit mysterious by leaving some pages blank and the fans can sort it out. "
