(which still makes no sense, the chest fell from the ceiling 7 years in the future so I go back in time to 7 years ago when it should still be in the ceiling because it fell behind a wall I can only get through if I'm 7 years younger?)"
83247,"pretty sure you can't even buy the Goron Tunic without talking to Goron Link first. The shop doesn't open up as an adult until you speak to him, and iirc the shop won't sell it to tiny you because it wouldn't fit."
83934,"Since the Kikwi, the Kokiri, and the Koroks all exist at entirely seperate points in Hylian history, it can be presumed there's been some evolution of the forest dwellers, heck, we meet an Ancient Kokiri spirit in the same time as the Koroks. As for their names, it could simply be down to the telephone game and translations within the universe. Guy wrote Kikwi in a dead language, ends up looking like Kokiri to another.

Another example is to look at the Zora and Rito. Rito supposedly evolved from Zora when the world flooded, which you'd think would be a good day to be a fish, but honestly, salt-water mixing with fresh-water would ruin the Zora Ecosystem and they evolved to exist not only above the water but as far as possible from it."
89617,"To be fair, it almost explains itself why the Kikwi became the Kokiri. They were all rescued on that day by a flesh and blood person, and they're normally incredibly shy. And that one was *as big as a house* so perhaps they either created the Kokiri to act as better forest guardians than themselves or shed their wooden bodies to become the Kokiri. Of course with them evolving back into wooden Koroks, it seems a bit overly cyclical, but maybe they did that so they could more easily sustain their bodies when the water cut them off from other food sources.

Point is, I, or even Nintendo for that matter, could sit here all day coming up with contrived reasons for how or why the Kikwi turned into Koroks in the end which were essentially what they were to begin with. But it wouldn't change how fun these games are, or our ability to enjoy them.

And yeah, the Zora into Rito is kind of contrived as well, but the whole salt-water fresh-water thing kind of makes some sense. And remember that we do have a distinction between River Zora and Ocean Zora, I believe that can be found in the Oracle games."

The frustrating thing about it was just that it shows up on the map when you get the compass, and the Stone of Sorrow appears on screen when you stand where the Chest falls, so it kind of makes you THINK there's something you can do to get it as a kid, but you can't."
