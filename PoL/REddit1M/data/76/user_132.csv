85173,"Yeah Link talks but that's why this works as a game and not as a TV series. The Hero isn't really known by anyone in the game. The legend was that they wore green clothes and was a person of whatever age. Everyone has a different idea of who they were or what they were like, just as we do as the player.

I doubt I'll ever enjoy this show, it doesn't sound like it is for me. I'm also not the target audience. I'm a huge Zelda fan and I like the games. While the stories are great in my opinion I'll admit they are somewhat flawed overall and wouldn't translate well to any other kind of media."
