So all they need to do is take the few bits and pieces that have been relatively consistent and make there own thing, kinda like what Nintendo seems to do with each new game. So Link, Ganondorf, the triforce, a sword, a shielding a bow, I think that's all that they really need."
18591,"What I mean though is there is nothing which can't be changed because Nintendo do it themselves all the time. For example the Zoras were originally enemies, but then OoT came along and changed that and Nintendo just retconed that there were two different types. And Sages, in OoT they are all different species then in TP they are suddenly all the same tall looking type of guy, and in LttP the maidens are all human as well. The ""Legend of Zelda"" where all princesses were to be called Zelda started with the sleeping Zelda in (i think) Zelda 2 but then every other game is a prequel to that and also has a Zelda in it.

Yes there are reoccurring things but the actual story linking the games is weak and clearly just made up by Nintendo after the fact and not really a priority to the,"

Are the sages human or not. That's the way Zelda works, there are reoccurring things, but most things change to fit the game, so they can also change to fit a tv show."

And when creating SS they did not think what makes most sense that the Kokari evolved from and came to the conclusion of penguin creatures, they just thought what would be good for this Forrest for this game. 

Same with the Zora it does not make sense for them to evolve into birds, it just doesn't, but that's what they wanted for that game, so they did it.

Nintendo don't have a plan, they just try to make the best game possible and have reoccurring elements, the story between does not make sense and Nintendo don't care. And the same can be done for the tv show, take common elements and use them to make a good show."

And going off what random changes Nintendo have been able to explain and get away with, a TV show would be able to do almost anything and still work."
