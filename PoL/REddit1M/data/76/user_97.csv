34127,I'm sure that there's a half decent fan fic they could rip off. 
34748,"I think I could see this working a bit. Continuity doesn't mean jack shit to LoZ, so a completly new story isn't out of the question. Link is all about action, while Ganondorf and Zelda are more about political advancement. Cut between shots of Link doing action things in dungeons and Ganondorf and Zelda circling one another politically, and it sounds okay. Link doesn't even necessarily have to talk either, there's a lot of emotion you can express with just your face, not to mention various grunts and yells. "
