109681,"OMG you know every character and every situation is going to be watered down to the lowest common denominator with only elbow nudges to the fans of the games like names and locations so it'll be super popular like Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones. It's live action, look at every Marvel Movie and how tame the characters are compared to their source material.

I swear, I have already made a drinking game for this show. You take a shot every time you hear a reviewer say something along the lines of ""Even people who have never played the games will love this show."""
