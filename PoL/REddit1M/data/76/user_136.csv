98367,"All jokes aside, an episode where he solves a dungeon puzzle would be a clever nod to the gameplay and serve as a great [bottle episode](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/BottleEpisode).  He's pushing blocks around all while engaged in another serious pressing matter in a room with a travelling companion.  He solves the puzzle after a breakthrough in character/plot development occurs and they open the chest only to find an empty glass jar.  His companion is outraged that they wasted time in a cold dark cave for seemingly nothing as he smiles in wonder and triumph because his half-full mentality means he can put whatever he wants in it.  


A glass jar.   A fucking bottle.

Bottle episode."
