35212,"Ok, can someone please tell me why a fish people would need to evolve into birds when the continent floods? Shouldnt this really be their new and thriving era of prosperity? Their domain just grew to encompass the entire continent! 

The zora did not turn into the Rito."
36186,"The Zora have already been land dwelling creatures and evolved back into water dwelling ones like whales. They are also intelligent and clearly optimized evolutionary for water life, so I submit that the rational decision of theirs would be to flourish in the environment they are accustomed to, and that has so greatly opened up to them."
36461,"The Zelda wiki describes the Zoras as such:

""...Zoras are divided into two known major subspecies: the River Zoras, and the Sea Zoras. River Zoras are known as the hostile enemy race that pop out of the water and fire energy balls at Link; whereas the peaceful Zoras are the Sea Zoras. The two differ physically. Despite their names, both types of Zora are known to inhabit both the ocean/sea and bodies of fresh water.""

And so they are definitely capable of living in salt water. 

I submit that the Rito are the descendants of the owl sage, and the Zoras left Hyrule to find a more stable, less ""besieged by the forces of evil every hundred years or so"" home, or at least not live right at the epicenter of it. "
36640,When did Aonuma say this? Where in Wind Waker is this explained? 
36918,"Yeah, I just looked up Zora salt water and that was the page I landed on, I haven't read it entirely.

I bought Wind Waker HD for my girlfriend on the weekend and while we were playing she asked if they were supposed to be the Zoras. I was confused because I didn't remember Zoras being in the game when I played it on the gamecube and thought it was ridiculous that birds with feathers would evolve from fish (at least in an intelligent species)

Why they would get rid of the Zoras in an ocean based Zelda is beyond me. A hidden underwater Zora kingdom with rumors of another one hidden deeper would have been great.
