39475,It is canon that the Temple of Time in TP is the same one as in OoT. It's in Hyrule Historia.
39865,"To quote myself:

&gt;According to Hyrule Historia, the Temple of Time was built on the location of the Sealed temple. (Pg. 77) Hyrule Historia then goes on to confirm that the Temple of Time in TP is the same Temple as in OoT, just that it has rotted away in the years between the games. (Pg. 117)"
39911,"The fact that this is the same/a similar temple building from OoT kind of excludes all the timelines. The Temple was torn down and built over in the Adult Timeline, it rotted away to basically nothing in the Child Timeline, and in the Downfall Timeline it's completely gone by the time of ALttP. I personally think this a reboot of the series post OoT."
57155,"Calamity Ganon. If not for him I could easily see this as a pre WW game, but there's no mention of Ganon pulling off something of that magnitude between any of the games.

ALttP, TP, and WW Ganon/Ganondorf are basically picking up right where they left off as of their respective ending/timeline of OoT.

In ALttP Ganon was sealed in the Sacred Realm by the Sages after the imprisoning war following his defeat of the Hero of Time..

In TP Ganondorf was stabbed, then tossed in the Twilight Realm shortly after link returns from the future. Spending the next however many centuries corrupting the realm, and plotting his revenge.

In WW Ganondorf busts out of the Sacred Realm after having been sealed there by the Sages after Link weakened him enough that he lost his Ganon form.

There's not really a spot for Ganon or Ganondorf to be the villain between these games, and the concept of a ""Flood Game"" is stupid in the first place, because you're doomed to fail from the beginning unless they do another OoT style time break."
59312,"Because two of those three games make direct references to Ocarina, and ALttP as of Hyrule Historia making the timeline official has direct references to what happens right after their timeline's version of Ocarina as well. There's no room for a game between them, because it gets weird if Hyrule was mostly abandoned, but nobody ever mentions that and there aren't any real ruins around to show that. Plus Calamity Ganon has to be related to Ganon somehow, otherwise it wouldn't look so porcine."
67515,[You're probably looking at him sideways.](http://zeldawiki.org/images/6/64/BotW_Calamity_Ganon_Trapped_in_Hyrule_Castle.png) Calamity Ganon looks vaguely like a cross of Pig Ganon from OoT and Beast Ganon from TP.
