35713,"Here are two possible reasons: first, maybe they were freshwater Zoras and couldn't adapt to the high salinity of the sea. This is probably negated by *Oracle of Ages*, in which the blue Zoras lived in the sea. Secund, and I think more likely, is that they were transformed surgically so none of them could reach the old kingdom under the waves. Who knows what could've happened had they reached it before a new hero was born?"
35901,"Besides that, evolutionists claim that all life on Earth came from the sea. Why did *Tiktaalik* or one of his buddies ever leave the comfort of a huge ocean to eventually become people and birds and such?"
36234,"With Zelda, you have to assume the absence of something simply means it wasn't worth mentioning. That's the only way to have a consistent story. We have to assume, for instance, that Hylia was always worshipped, just not mentioned. Her shrine was always in the Temple of Time, just not pictured in OoT. It's either that, or you have to invent stories on how and why races, landmarks, and religions go extinct and get revived between so many different games. I sleep at night by telling myself that these games are meant to be livable legends. They aren't accurate accounts of every detail, though what details are included is generally true. They all share the same map, just drawn by different Tingles, some with better cartography skills than others."
36604,"The Kakariko Village in TP seems to be the same as in OoT. The best explanation is that Old Kakariko is actually older than OoT. Impa wasn't the last Sheikah as she claimed, there was actually a hidden settlement somewhere.

I'm quite fond of the idea that the Twili were the other Demons who were banished into the Twilight Realm before the events of SS. (Maybe they were also Sheikah, but who knows?) But if that **isn't** the case, maybe the evil Sheikah who tried to steal the Triforce and became the Twili lived in this hidden village, and Impa was the only *loyal* member left."
37060,"Ordon Village bears a striking resemblance to the Kokiri Village. Maybe Link returned there as an adult, saw it abandoned, and decided to settle it. That doesn't explain the bizarre placing of the Temple of Time, though.

Althoughâ€”and this is just a hunch that I haven't researchedâ€”if a northern migration is canon, maybe all of Hyrule Castle and Castle Town is in the Sacred Grove as OP suggested. That doesn't explain the relative placements of Lake Hylia and Death Mountain, but it helps to rectify the Temple of Time.

Here are a few possible ideas explaining these issues:
1. The people found new landmarks further north that resembled old ones and renamed them. This creates other inconsistencies with why the Zoras and Gorons must've apparently moved, though, so I don't like this option.
2. The map of OoT was politically motivated after the end of the Civil War. The King of Hyrule wanted to include the Lanayru and Eldin provinces in the domain of Hyrule, so he had his map maker scrunch them together to remove the distances. Then, for reasons unknown, the old castle was abandoned and the people migrated to a more central region."
37714,"How do you know they were formally land dwellers? SS seemed to suggest that they evolved from the Parella. Their human-like form suggests convergent evolution, adapting to live on land and not vice versa. Thus becoming birds would be a natural progression, not a regression."
37929,"Ultimately, it's because that's what the designers chose to do. For an in-game explanation, I think the best is that the gods didn't want them disturbing Hyrule since it was to remain hidden until the hero arose.

If it helps, it seems that they weren't originally able to fly. That probably came centuries later, after they befriended Valoo."
44591,I didn't even think about that! ðŸ˜® That's a brilliant observation!
44651,Who's crucifying you? I'm just answering your question. Chill.
44737,"Oh thanks, I forgot about that. Well then it seems pretty clear that the old castle and its ruins are in the Sacred Grove."
