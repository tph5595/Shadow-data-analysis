204286,"I always wondered why Castle Town in TP was so far from the Temple of Time, but that doesn't explain why the Temple is in the Lost Woods so far from the center of Hyrule, as Death Mountain, Lake Hylia, the Gerudo Desert, Kakariko Village, and the Lost Woods are all in relatively the same position as in OoT. Personally I always thought it was due to N64 limitations and that the TP locations were more accurate. Like in ALttP, only Hyrule Castle is in the same place :P Because of the graphics and memory upgrades, they're able to expand Hyrule, so I don't think that there was an ""Old"" and a ""New"" Hyrule Castle, just that Nintendo changed their locations as the games were made on newer better consoles."
204444,Yeah asleep is a LOT different than dead and resurrected.
205007,"Except there's only 2 games where Link is the Hero of Time. WW is the Hero of the Winds, etc etc, they each had their own title."
