70350,"The problem with that though is that some of the games either directly relate to or reference earlier games or Heroes of Hyrule. Wind Waker, for example, starts out by telling the player of the events directly after Ocarina of Time, with Link missing and Ganon having to be taken out with the flood."
71885,"My theory (which is apparently the most common, but I'll say it anyway) is that this game takes place between Ocarina of Time and Wind Waker and will end with the flood. I also think the game might bridge some of the story gap between Skyward Sword and OoT/WW.

The theory started in my head before I saw the Korok, so it's not necessarily important to my idea. In the stream when they spoke to the old man he mentioned the plateau being where Hyrule started, to me this is obviously a reference to Skyloft coming down (I'm probably not very special in that regard). The next thing that I noticed was the Temple of Time, as soon as I saw it I instantly knew what it was, the shape and design are nearly identical, so when I saw it I knew that what was around it was supposed to be Castle Town, which appears to be in ruins. This could conflict with what we know of Hyrule Castle and the surrounding area in Wind Waker, BUT it's completely possible that when the Goddesses flooded the land they also rebuilt the castle and area as a backup plan to be used by the next hero to appear.

The only other part I have to this theory is really more of a guess, and it's that I think the final boss won't be Ganon, but instead it will be the 3 Goddesses. Link and Zelda will somehow learn of their plan for the flood and try to stop them, but in the final cutscene they will be persuaded and they'll understand that it's what must be done fo the good of the world.

Sorry if anything seems off, it's mostly just a stream of consciousness that might have some inaccuracies since I haven't played OoT or WW in probably more than 6 months and I only watched the first day's stream one time and haven't had a chance to watch the rest. I hope someone gets some enjoyment out of my ideas though."
