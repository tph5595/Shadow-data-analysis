39519,"That's an interesting argument. I definitely would have been okay with that being the truth of the games, where each one resells a classic myth but in its own way. Very realistic idea in concept, if not reality. 

However, the timeline seems alright. It's not THAT complicated, and does give good context to the games relative to each other while making sure there is enough time between games to allow other games to form between. I think that's part of why I like the timeline, actually. With distances between some games edging into the thousands of years, there's a lot of room to grow that doesn't necessarily involve growing down. "
