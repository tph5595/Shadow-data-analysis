21639,"Now, if we saw Rito, then I'd definitely say it's on the adult timeline, and post WW, at that. As the evolution of Zora into bird-people was a response to the Great Flood, not brought about by their guardian entity.

However, even without that, I'm still thinking it's set post WW, after the sea dries up. Simply because of the Koroks, combined with the salt item's description, and that the old man does look a bit like King Daphnes. And this Link is the one that never appeared to stop Ganon, leading to the flooding of Hyrule. Maybe Ganon got to Link first, killing him (which make the Room of Resurrection's name even more important), after his experience in Ocarina of Time."
35600,My idea was that maybe Ganon found and killed the new Link before he awakened as the Hero and set out on his journey.
36147,"One, Aonuma explicitly stated they evolved from the Zora.

Two, the game is almost as explicit about them evolving from the Zora.

Medli is descended from the bloodline of the Zora Earth Sage, Laruto.

The Zora's Sapphire symbol/Zora Royal Family emblem is the emblem of the Rito tribe.

If the OoT Zora are physiologically similar to the MM Zora, they'd have a tough time living in water that is not at an optimum temperature, or is murky."
36713,"If you're going to cite the wiki, why don't you read up on the Rito while you're there? You'll see many clear links, and a statement from Aonuma.

I'm all for theorycrafting, but you can't deny explicit canon. Well, you can, but then everybody else will treat you like a fool."

And I didn't say it was explained in the game, I said it was ALMOST as explicit. The biggest being Medli, a Rito, being descended from a Zora."
37050,"OoT Link stopped Ganon in the adult timeline, he defeated him. He was sent back in time after that, and the adult timeline continues from there. Ganon returns, and no Hero answers. Previously, and this could still be the case, it was assumed that the Hero's soul was no more in that timeline (and that WW Link would be an entirely new Hero's soul). My theory, and I'm not entirely sticking by it, is that the Hero's soul remained, despite Link being sent to the past. In the adult timeline, it was reincarnated, but that Link never went on his quest to stop Ganon. Because the first thing Ganon did upon awakening, was seek him out and kill him. Link was retrieved and put into the resurrection chamber, but before he could be resurrected, something went down. After which, with no Hero, the Goddesses responded to the prayers of the people and flooded Hyrule. Leading into Wind Waker. Then a bit into the future, the Great Sea dries up, and Link is resurrected to save and revive the dying kingdom.

This theory would give them a lot more wiggle room, allowing the idea of multiple Hero souls, as there is a second one reincarnated from the WW Link."
39154,"I'm not saying it's OoT Link.

Though the statement about Link being asleep for 100 years does throw a wrench into the post-WW theory."

And there is no Zora Island."
142738,"It was Greatfish Isle, home of Jabun, and presumably where the scrapped third dungeon would've gone. At one point in development, it may have been home to Zora, and Dragonroost to Gorons, but they decided to shake things up, and they ended up cutting a few dungeons."
143277,"In an interview in 2003 Miyamato said there were two dungeons cut, as well some game mechanics. It's not clear what the two dungeons were, but the general consensus is the dungeon that was supposed to be on Greatfish Isle, and a third temple holding a sage."
144580,"Notably, the two temples still present in Wind Waker are the two temples cut from Ocarina of Time, the Wind Temple and Earth Temple. They worked into the lore that the sages of Wind and Earth constantly pray to keep the Master Sword empowered, instead of using their powers like the other sages. This explains in universe why they weren't present in Ocarina of Time, as the sword was still sharp and filled with evil's bane."
145376,"Well, in ALttP, the Master Sword can't damage Ganon, it has to be upgraded first by dwarves, and then by a Great Fairy, and upon returning it to its pedestal, it appears to return to normal. The implication being that the sword has weakened, lost its edge, and its evil's bane, and is granted those again temporarily.

And in ALBW, while it doesn't require upgrading to harm Ganon, you can upgrade it and the upgrades are visually similar to ALttP.

Twilight Princess, the Seven Sages (down one after Ganondorf killed him) appear to be alive and well, so the two additional Sages of Earth and Wind can be presumed to be alive and well. It is upgraded in the Twilight Realm, however once you leave the Twilight Realm that upgrade go away.

Wind Waker, you have to restore the Sages of Earth and Wind.

Ocarina of Time, as we discussed, they aren't present, and the implication from WW is that they were doing their duty already.

Skyward Sword is before the advent of the Sages. The sword's power was fresh and had yet to wane over time.

And in Breath of the Wild, we see that the Master Sword is rusted and pitted."
