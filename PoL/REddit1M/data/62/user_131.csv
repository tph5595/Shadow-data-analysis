49634,"That's what I've been arguing here.  The ending of WindWaker is pretty damn clear on the fate of Hyrule, and the subsequent games continue that line of thought.  To bring back Hyrule in that timeline is to destroy the whole point of that branch, and removes all significance from everybody's actions.  It weakens the narrative of the branch, removing all gravitas of the plot events associated with it.  

If anything, I believe that this will take place in the Link Defeated branch. It allows for all the destruction of Hyrule and Calamity Ganon, not to mention that Nintendo has been fascinated by that particular branch lately."
