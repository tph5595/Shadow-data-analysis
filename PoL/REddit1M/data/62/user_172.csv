163167,"I would like to make note that the Master Sword chamber is completely missing from the Temple of Time in BotW. 
You can see the chamber near the back of the temple in the 1st and 3rd image. But in none of the BotW images. 
Also the Door of Time has been replaced by statues of the Goddess Hylia."
