24114,Undoing the entire permanent effect of Wind Waker and its themes seems like a really dumb idea from a storytelling perspective.
44102,"Spirit Tracks takes place in an entirely new land.  Hyrule, Ganon, and the Master Sword were all left behind (not to mention everything else like the Four Sword et cetera).  It even seems like the Triforce might have been almost totally forgotten.

Bringing them back in the Adult Timeline seems really foolish.  The entire point of Wind Waker was that Old Hyrule **died**.  And that it was time to for the world to move on."
47603,"Don't put too much merit into rust = old thinking.

We know what happens when the Master Sword is left to sit for a long time - it depowers.  We learned that in Wind Waker.

A key trait of a depowered Master Sword is that her hiltguard retracts.  And when it did that in Wind Waker, it still appeared as a perfectly pristine sword - just a weaker one.  However, if you look at the Master Sword in BotW, its hiltguard is still prominent.

The fact that the Master Sword is rusty but not traditionally depowered strongly suggests to me that the problem is due to it being **intentionally damaged**.  Like, say, the Hero who is getting ""resurrected"" at the start of the game took her to a fight with Ganon and lost.

Plus the Master Sword has sat out in the open wilderness for centuries before, and no harm has ever come to it.  The Master Sword being chipped and rusty is going to be a way more significant thing than ""it hasn't been used in a long time""."
48504,"&gt; how did the sword return to the pedestal?

That is the big question.  Regardless, I think there is significant reason to believe that the Master Sword would not become rusted and chipped -- especially chipped -- just from passage of time.

&gt;Furthermore, why is it sitting in the location from A Link to the Past rather than location it's in in Wind Waker?

It's just a pedestal in the forest, who knows where that is.  If this is pre-Flood the obvious solution is that Link will move the Master Sword into the castle and use it to seal Ganon's power (like we know happened from Wind Waker).

&gt;Finally, why are the buildings intact in Wind Waker if everything is destroyed in Breath of the Wild?

The only building we saw in WW was Hyrule Castle, and it looks fine here - if covered in Ganonclouds."
49785,"That's possible.

I'm going with the Flood Game itself here.

We're going to see the Hero Who Failed, why Ganon couldn't be stopped, why he had to be buried under an ocean.  The koroks are already transformed, but that would actually make sense to happen before the Flood began proper, if the Deku Tree was aware that the Flood was planned."
302274,"The Wind Waker backstory is an in-world legend told by the people of the Great Sea, who themselves have forgotten that they even live directly on top of Hyrule.

The legend itself includes inaccuracies, even - the people of Hyrule apparently believed that the Hero of Time was a true time traveler, a 16-year-old who would hop from era to era saving people (which is not correct).  They did not know the Hero reincarnated, and were waiting for the **literal** Hero of Time.

There is very little reason to believe that the history of the people of the Great Sea is accurate.  They are unreliable.

Also:

**Someone** sealed Ganon's power in the Master Sword and timelocked Hyrule Castle."
310109,"&gt; So they'd forget that a Hero stopped Ganon, something incredibly significant?

Why would they remember someone who isn't the Hero of Time doing something they wouldn't see?

&gt;And then this would mean even after you succeed in BoTW, Ganon would come back again when there's no Link?

You mean in Wind Waker?  Yes, that's what happened.

&gt;Because the sages used the Triforce to ask the Gods to save Hyrule, the the Gods flooded it.

The Triforce of Power was in Ganon's hands, nobody could make a wish.

&gt;I doubt the cause of the flood would be an inaccuracy in the History. If you have to change an entire backstory to a game to make your theory work then I think it's incredibly flawed.

The backstory of the game is already flawed.  The gods do not care about Hyrule, or they would have intervened a dozen other places."
312547,"&gt; but they definitely payed to the Goddesses to stop Ganon, and the world was flooded as a result.

And yet Daphnes is the one who expresses an extremely personal guilt for what happened with the Flood.

&gt;but the ENTIRE BACKSTORY being different just so you can make your theory work

Again, the backstory is already extremely flawed and it's written by **humans who do not remember what Hyrule is**.

If a Hero failed, he wouldn't be remembered -- or how many people remember the Hero of Time in the fallen timeline?

If Breath of the Wild is the Flood Game, the Hero's victory condition will probably amount to making sure Ganon is turned back into a human so that dropping an ocean on his head actually works.  Why would anybody notice him doing that, exactly, if they've already fled?

-----

Saying the backstory is correct just because it's the backstory is willful blindness.  Half the point of Wind Waker is that the people were wrong about the Hero of Time, because the Hero reincarnates, and the Hero of Winds proved it."
313629,"&gt; but there is also evidence for either of the other two timelines

Yes, absolutely.  I never said there wasn't.

&gt;At the end of the day I have all my cards on the table, but you're putting all your eggs into one basket.

Lol.  I'm really not as invested as you think I am."
