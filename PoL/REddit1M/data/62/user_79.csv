33590,Not exactly. A lot of signs point to it being the last game in the time line. For example it wouldn't make sense for the Master Sword to be rusted and for it to be in what appears to be the location its in in a LttP. I suspect it's the last game either in the Wind Waker timeline or the Zelda 1 timeline
