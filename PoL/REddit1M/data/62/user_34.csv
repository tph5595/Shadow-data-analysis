12166,"Incredible. The Temple of Time and old Castle Town are right where they should be... But Hyrule Castle was rebuilt further north, probably in the wake of all that destruction when it came crashing down. That being the case, why are they on a giant plateau now? Did something monumental happen to the land there? 


It's possible that we're looking at the workings of magic here. Maybe the Sheikah used their tech to raise the land because of the landmark- and looking at the geography of it... It looks like perhaps the cave you emerge from was originally the Great Fairy Fountain near Castle Town in Ocarina of Time. It would explain the healing/regenerative properties at work.


I mean, if I wanted to build a rejuvenation chamber for the hero, I would probably build it on top of a fairy fountain and just sort of amp it up. Regardless, it's likely the land was raised to protect the hero's resting place (if my theory is correct). 


Simply fascinating."
