18091,"People only really recognize the hero by his green clothes. And now as it seems that Link will be without the green tunic for most part of the game, it still might be possible that he's pulling a few strings during that time without people really ""noticing"". Which basically means that he wouldn't be part of the legends and myths which people are passing through the generations. 

They said the green tunic will definitely be in the game, but I think it will be more of an extra like the Hylia Shield in SS. Just for tradition.

So I think a flood game is definitely possible. 

(but considering the ruins I rather think it might be a game after the Great Sea passes and sets the old Hyrule free again. Though it would be a little weird since then there would be 2 Hyrules. But maybe they have an explanation for that.)"
