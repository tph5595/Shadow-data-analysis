6065,"In OoT Hyrule castle is right next to the Temple of Time, which is far away from the Lost Woods  
In TP the latter two are right next to one another, and far removed from Hyrule castle.   
In WW the ToT is just down the road from Hyrule castle, and Hyrule castle was properly built up again and not the shit-heap it was left in at the end of OoT.  
  
Meanwhile many believe that this is a continuation of the ""Fall of the Hero"" timeline with the original NES and SNES games, but obviously there's no way to know that.  
  
Koroks, the bridge of Eldin, and a world that long died; it basically belongs to all three timelines where the ToT is sort of in a different place each time.  
  
Starting to think that, like Castlevania and Dark Souls, the land is transitory and ever-changing; it manifests itself anew for each new game. Same basic pieces, but realigned.  
  
They're going to prey on our nostalgia and no two games do it the same each time; it's hard for them to not hit the mark here."
