273578,"I disagree. It's not really constricting when you consider how much time they have to work with and the fact that there's no visible end in sight. If they had to fit every game within a thousand year span of time it would be difficult, but they can go as far into the future as they want or put things between existing games, and having three different timelines to work with gives them even more leeway.    
    
    
The second Zelda was a direct sequel to the first, the fourth Zelda was a direct sequel of the third, the sixth a direct sequel to the fifth. They seem to have had a timeline going from the beginning, releasing it didn't constrict them. Having a timeline allows them to pull from each other and expand on previous titles while still leaving them free to create ""standalone"" titles by setting it 500 years or in the future or something and place it on a random timeline. My second and third favorite titles are direct sequels, so I'm happy they have them.
