That's what I'd always believed, they really only appear as blond haired white skinned human children with pointy ears, when there is a blonde haired white skinned human child with pointy ears living with them, they are forest spirits after all, the Korok form makes much more sense"

We only see them looking like blonde pointy-eared children when they have to look after a blonde pointy-eared child after all"
