28085,"I would love BotW to take place before WW because of the old Valley of the Flood/Deluge hoax. If this game ends with Link flooding Hyrule...

This game might possibly have alternate endings and it might even cause another timeline split. Might. However, most likely, this game takes place in Adult timeline post ST. Perhaps we might even be able to explore New Hyrule in this."

Let say he managed to finish a main dungeon and talk to the important NPCs to unlock his memories, and he enters the Temple of Time. Then, we can explore Link's memories from a 100 years ago in a limited space since I don't believe Nintendo is able to create a whole new overworld. If they do though, that'll be great."
28395,I rather it take place near the end of a timeline though.
