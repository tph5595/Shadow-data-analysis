37817,SS also had an ocean. The map in BotW also has an coastline in the south east of the map.
39767,Not necessarily the ocean in SS covered a third of that world within the south west it could of easily spread. Again there is still an ocean to the south-east of BotW's map. It's pretty much impossible to guess that an ocean used to cover the world when sand travels so easily.
