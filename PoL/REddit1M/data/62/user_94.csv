I have some evidence for BotW going after Zelda II. First of all both NES Zeldas (which we know are ""downfall timeline"" games, have almost no civilization in them. I believe that this place is a new Hyrule, named after the legendary kingdom of old. Hyrule is described as a ""small kingdom"" in Zelda II's manual, with its sparse villages and palaces, while TLoZ had virtually no civilization. Until we see what they mean when they say ""there will be towns in BotW"", we can't be sure of how they will look, but I have a good feeling that they will be a natural progression of Zelda II's towns.

Calamity Ganon is also a good indicator that BotW comes after Zelda II. Remember that Ganon was dead in Zelda II, and needed Link's blood to be revived. It seems to me that Calamity Ganon is Ganon slowly regaining his strength through the Triforce of Power.

Now I know that the Koroks are making people think that this game needs to go somewhere in the WW timeline, but we need to remember that the Koroks are not a direct product of the flood. As long as the Kokiri are endagered, the Deku Tree will turn them into Koroks, who are more suited for a harsher forest life, like life on the Great Plateau.

Please feel free to tear my argument apart or upvote me if you agree."
