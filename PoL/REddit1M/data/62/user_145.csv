59843,"Basically, the ending of OoT split the timeline into two parts, with a third one that just shows what happens if Link fails to stop Ganondorf entirely.

In the first, Link defeats Ganondorf as an Adult, and the princess uses her magic to send him away (returning him to the beginning of the game as a child). This ends up being a bad plan, as it seems to have prevented a new Hero from appearing when Ganondorf returned and was close to actually winning. To prevent this, the king (iirc) flooded Hyrule with the Triforce and caused Wind Waker, Phantom Hourglass, and Spirit Tracks to happen.

The second timeline is created when Link, sent back from the first one, manages to help Zelda convince the king of Ganondorf's evil despite being a Child (likely using the spiritual stones to add weight to his claim). Ganondorf is set to be executed, but survives and is instead banished to the Twilight Realm. Link goes off into the woods to search for 'a friend' and Majora's Mask happens. Once he gets back from Termina, we know he becomes a knight and dies many years later. Then Twilight Princess happens.

The final timeline is known as the Failure Timeline. It occurs when Link dies trying to stop Ganondorf, and encompasses most of the older games (LoZ, Adventure of Link, etc) in a Hyrule ravaged by the long Imprisoning War that it took to seal the 'dorf away without the Hero. Most of the stuff mentioning Maidens and Sages takes place here.

So the three lines (and their most recent game chronologically) are Adult (Spirit Tracks), Child (Four Swords Adventure), and Failure (Adventure of Link). I hope that helps!"
