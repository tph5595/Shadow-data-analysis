If this is in the Adult or Downfall Timelines, and the Temple of Time we see is the same from OoT, then it makes sense that Hyrule Castle would have migrated northward, as the original Hyrule Castle would have been destroyed by Ganon. And the remains of the original castle would be in the Plateau area.

I'm not seeing the similarities in the TP pictures, though."
