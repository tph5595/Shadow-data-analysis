Imagine stumbling on the ruins of a village where all that remains are the foundations of houses that are laid out in the same positions as Kakariko Village from OoT.  It wouldn't even be immediately obvious that it's a village, and most people would probably run right past it thinking it's some generic ruin.  But someone out there would recognize it and feel such a rush of nostalgia..."

It looks like in TP there have been these chasms and canyons that opened up, and the rivers the Zoras used to get around may have changed paths.  It's possible they relocated to a new wellspring which connected to the main river network again."

It's a bit far fetched, I admit, but it's cool to think about."

Besides, as much as I love OoT, its map was designed much more with gameplay in mind than maintaining future continuity.  So I would definitely trust the Twilight Princess map of Hyrule more going forward.  Things like Zora's Domain can easily float around to fit amongst other parts of the map depending on the game, and it's still the same Zora's Domain every time."
