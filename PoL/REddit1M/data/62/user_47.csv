17669,"What do you mean by ""Old Kakariko? If you mean the Hidden Village, I'm wouldn't be so quick to call it that. I'd sooner call Ordon Village the remnants/successor of OoT Kakariko based on the placement of the ToT. The problem is that places a mountain just outside Ordon (which actually kind of works, maybe OoT Death Mountain became dormant and lush), another lake west of Ordon, and a huge mass Northward migration between OoT and TP of all the species in Hyrule."

The master sword is the keystone the keeps Ganondorf in place (ie in stone) and Old Hyrule is also completely flooded beyond return, meaning someone would need a submarine to get down there, and a pressure suit to get in contact with the sword, and it's probably a King Arthur deal so some random can't remove it. He's gone."
