Between the ancient Lanayru Sea, and the fact that there's literally an existing ocean in this world, it's not a stretch that rock salt would be laying around."

They were expecting a valiant, triumphant conqueror to come save them from Roman subjugation and to bring their nation into power again. I wonder if the legend of the Hero of Time got so overblown that they were expecting some majestic hero to come stop Ganon in power and glory, and didn't end up seeing the real hero as a result?  
  
Though, my personal theory is that you're playing as the hero, but something prevented his journey from ever even starting in the first place, resulting in him waking up 100 years later."

We have a general idea of what OOT's Hyrule looked like, but it was seriously limited by the N64's power. For example, we have to assume that Kakariko Village is more than like, 200 yards away from Castle Town because in the scale of a real world, they'd be the same town if they were that close together. We have to assume that a lot of OOT's Hyrule, if envisioned with modern technology, would have a lot of discrepancies with what we actually saw back then, both in size and geography. Putting Castle Town on a plateau in OOT might have looked weird next to the flat Hyrule Field.  
  
Also, Hyrule Castle was *sort* of on a plateau in OOT. Like, there were ridges all about and it was raised up on a big hill. If we just extend that geography to Castle Town, it makes sense."
