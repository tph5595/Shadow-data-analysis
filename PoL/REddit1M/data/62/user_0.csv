2809,"And let's not forget Hyrule Historia:

&gt; The descendants of the goddess Hylia, who was reincarnated as Princess Zelda, established the kingdom of Hyrule and became Hyrule's royal family. **In order to protect the Triforce, Hyrule Castle was built in the center of Hyrule, where the Temple of Time was located.**

Does that match with Breath of the Wild? Let's ask the Old Man:
&gt; This is the Great Plateau. According to legend, this is the birthplace of the entire kingdom of Hyrule.

Since the Temple of Time is here, and this place is acknowledged to be the birthplace of Hyrule, it stands to reason that Castle Town *has* to be present in some form, whether fully standing or in ruins."
40174,"The TP map is screwy in many ways. It literally flips the locations of Zora's Domain and Death Mountain - in *every* other instance, Death Mountain is relatively north-west from Zora's Domain. BotW seems to flip them back into place, leaving TP as an outlier."
40864,"I'm not saying anything timeline-wise, although the existence of town ruins (and a form of Ganon) should imply a post-OoT placement. Whether this game is on the Adult timeline, Child timeline, or Fallen timeline is up to you to decide."
41334,"It's a location on the Great Plateau. You can see it labeled within the green circle in [this image](http://imgur.com/ng6ofa8).

And you're misunderstanding. Of course that structure surrounded by Calamity Ganon is Hyrule Castle. The point is that there have been numerous Hyrule Castles before, not just one."
41371,Yes. It's a companion that appears if you use the Wolf Link Amiibo.
62452,"I don't know why the plateau is raised - maybe it was always like that, canonically.

As for the concept of numerous castles, it's a common theory that arose when Twilight Princess came around. TP showed a castle that was *very* far from the Temple of Time, leading to theories that it couldn't have been the same castle from OoT."
62537,"I've pondered on that idea, but the Zoras refer to it as their ancestral home during TP... which implies it's supposed to be the same location."
62764,"They wouldn't have replaced a bustling Castle Town with ruins, if that's what you're implying. There might have been small settlements and a few NPCs in the area, but not Castle Town."
63021,Somehow this makes me feel honored!
63128,That's the point - it can't be before OoT if Castle Town is in ruins.
142991,"That's one of three identical areas surrounding the Temple of Time, but it's not in the abbey."
162976,That's amazing! I've added that to the Imgur album and referenced you :)
