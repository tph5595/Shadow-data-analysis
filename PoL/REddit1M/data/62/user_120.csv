45193,Which is a new concept to me (numerous castles its cool) but like wait so the outer castle wall is the entire plateau wall? WOW thats awesome question is.. why did the land mass rise up to wall hight inside of it :I 
67116,I think my brain just got around that as viewing all the games as separate lol but it does help with the idea of the games actually having a timeline now.. I'm glad you brought all this up though just now because it makes me wonder what things we may find from the other games :D
