142567,Thanks for the link. Been a long time since I've played WW. So then what was  the island that Ganondorf destroyed? 
143079,A few? What other dungeons were there supposed to be? I  know OoT had some allegedly cut content.

144772,"Which is strange, considering that there's no Sages to keep the Master Sword sharp in any other game. "
145562,Fair enough. And in SS you turn the Goddess Sword into the Master Sword via the flames. Though I guess that just leaves one to question why the Master Sword in OoT was still sharp.
