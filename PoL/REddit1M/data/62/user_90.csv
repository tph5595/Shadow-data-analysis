Personally, I want to believe this is SS Link because he's right handed, but if he's only been out for 100 years then it feels like Skyward Sword would've been to long ago to fit that timeframe. The most likely theory that I've heard is that he's OoT Link, resurrected after being killed by Ganon in the downfall timeline."
