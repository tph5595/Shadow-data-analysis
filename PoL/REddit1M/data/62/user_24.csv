9523,Judging by the villians that follow you in Phantom hour glass and Spirit tracks I would say he was killed.
9599,"The koroks are just kokiri that were transformed in a time of dire need to spread the deku seeds. They could easily pop up in the other timelines, as the last time we even saw a kokiri was the celebration ending of MM."
9741,while fitting evolution it was a magical transformation hastened by the deku tree. Similar to how the Zora became the Rito with the help of Valoos magical scales.

But yes for this to be the old castle town and temple location it would need to be the Adult or downfall timeline. I would actually put it in the downfall line, between Links awakening and Zelda 1. As the timeline has that period (of which no game currently takes place) listed as ""The golden age"" because the monarchy uses the triforce (it would explain the sheika tech) for the betterment of the kingdom. Then everything goes to shit in the ""Tragedy of Princess Zelda the 1st"". And somehow Ganon is in power during Zelda 1. 

So something happened there."
10611,"Ive talked about it elsewhere, but the Koroks could easily exist in any timeline. You take kokiri and give them deku tree magic and boom, koroks. Both the adult (windwaker) and downfall (link to the past) timelines have dire events which could force the Deku tree to transform the kokiri from defenders to seed bearering koroks. And beyond the ending of MM we dont see the kokiri ever again. They could have easily all been transformed in every timeline a short time after the new Deku tree grew of age."
