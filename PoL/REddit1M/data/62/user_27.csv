10479,"The aged Master Sword and wide empty world (although there will be towns, obviously) actually makes me wonder if this takes place after Zelda 2 (NES)."
58997,"I know the NES games didn't have the Master Sword, which is why the rusted out sword may make me think it's even after those. Because so much time has gone by with it simply being forgotten. It wasn't used at all in the NES games because in the first one Link was like 8 with NO guidance and just did his best and in the sequel he was in another country anyway. 

Obviously we have no idea but that's my thoughts. "
