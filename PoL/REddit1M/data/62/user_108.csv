40604,Cutting corners? How exactly?
44652,"Do you understand that those assets aren't actually being reused for the most part? Granted, a lot can be done with lighting to change the mood 'enough', but it's obvious from all of the footage we've seen that the models and textures are all very specifically weathered/broken. To change those to new/clean/working for a time shift means most if not all of the assets will have to be different.

I get what you mean about the *idea* being stale (although I think it's a silly argument), but claiming that it's just a way to cut corners shows that you obviously have no clue what it takes to develop a game."

Considering that your argument is severely flawed, I think, ""no clue what it takes to develop a game,"" is a perfectly reasonable conclusion.

&gt; It's cutting corners to give the perception of an expanded world.

No, it isn't.

If you take a look at the gameplay footage, it's pretty obvious that they haven't cut corners on the world. At all. It is *already* expanded. It's absolutely huge, and gorgeous. 'Cutting corners' implies that they are doing something to save themselves from having to work. If OP's idea of a time shift is correct, they would be nearly doubling their development time. The proper way to cut corners would be to start with the idea of a time shift and then, you know, *choose not to do it*. I'm not convinced that the time shift will exist in this game, but if it does, it would be a huge deal, and it most certainly wouldn't be 'cutting corners' in any sense of the phrase.

The only thing that makes sense, as I try to understand your argument, is that you think simply reusing the same locations would be a cheat. If that's actually what you're saying, are you also going to argue that they are cutting corners by 'reusing' Hyrule Castle from game to game? Or the Temple of Time? Or the Koroks? Is it cutting corners that they are still using Link and Zelda? Or that Ganon is still the bad guy?"
