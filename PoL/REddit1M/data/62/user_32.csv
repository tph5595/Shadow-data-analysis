11633,"Link has been asleep for 100 years.  Calamity Ganon has been around for 100 years.  The master sword is badly damaged and rusted.

This Link probably got his ass kicked 100 years ago.  The timing matches and something major must have went down if the master sword is in such sorry shape.  The voice is trying to get him to remember as well.  Having an old Link from a previous era remember wouldn't do any good.  She's trying to get this Link to remember what happened 100 years ago because it is likely necessary in defeating Calamity Ganon.  "

There is no mention of Calamity Ganon, a 100 year siege/containment within Hyrule Castle, or a hero coming back to defeat him.  None of these events are mentioned anywhere in the decline timeline.  Kind of big details to have received no mention.  "
