2767,"If this game takes place between OoT and Wind Waker, A.K.A. the ""Flood Game"", I would be so happy. Really though, I am most excited for the gameplay! And that the Skeikah will be making a big appearance."
4305,"Well the Great Deku Tree could have had a pre-warning from the gods of their plan to flood Hyrule, and had his children transform early. Also, we know a Ganon exists between OoT and WW, but we don't know if one could exist after WW, considering he was kind of killed, even though I personally believe he was just sealed in WW"
4595,"Maybe another timeline split? Although WW said that the Hero didn't appear... maybe they meant that he didn't appear in *time*, and that only the protectors of Hyrule, the Sheikah, could subdue Ganon, thus the need to resurrect Link. But resurrect from where? Was this Link simply created? It said he was asleep for a 100 years... Gosh I can't place this game anywhere man!"
46091,Lol like fake Batman in The Dark Knight style? lmao that's funny imagining a bunch of asshats in green getting wrecked by Calamity Ganon
46182,Every 3d Zelda game seems to take from OoT in some way. It would be funny if the new one just toke away what made the game unique
