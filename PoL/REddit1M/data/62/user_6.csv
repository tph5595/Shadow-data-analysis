3756,The inclusion of Koroks means it takes place after Ocarina of Time since they evolved form the Kokiri.
5165,"It can sort of fit into all three timelines:

* Hyrule seems desolate and in decline which fits with the Decline Timeline.

* There are Koroks which would imply the Adult Timeline.

* A lot of the geography is very reminiscent of Twilight Princess which would mean the Child Timeline, although I'm doubtful of this because we know that Ganondorf is immediately sealed in the Twilight Realm.

Although someone made a good point in that for all we know this game could take place hundreds of years after Spirit Tracks where Hyrule somehow became unflooded during that time."
