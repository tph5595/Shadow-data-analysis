61605,"I seem to be the only one leaning towards this, but I'm thinking it takes place on the Child Timeline due to the presence of three things:

* Eldin Bridge (or possibly Great Bridge of Hylia)
* The Temple of Time
* Wolf Link

While the two structures likely exist in some form in other timelines, the presence of a summonable Wolf Link tells me that it takes place in the same timeline as Twilight Princess, albeit centuries later."
