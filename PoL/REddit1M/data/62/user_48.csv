17513,"Whenever Hyrule is in great peril or Demise/an incarnation of Demise shows up, a hero appears. If Ganon was there, then a Link was there. He just didn't succeed, and thus was forgotten in history. But if Ganon was there, which he was, then a Link by default also had to show up. Perhaps the people of Hyrule were so caught up in looking for THE hero, as in the ""Of Time"" one, they missed the hero that was right in front of them."
