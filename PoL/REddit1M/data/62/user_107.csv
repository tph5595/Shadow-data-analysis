40419,"Ganon is revived and found a way to travel between dimensions or timelines. Defeats/kills Link in all timelines to converge them into one timeline where he rules Hyrule. Goddess(es) awaken/resurrect a Link from the original timeline before the split to restore balance, defeat Ganon, and maybe revitalise Hyrule. Throw in a Princess Zelda awakening/resurrection, some triforce or goddess magic, temple sages, dungeons, plot, and viola, new LoZ installment and a more manageable timeline. 

I'd play it."
