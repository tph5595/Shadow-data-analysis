302078,But there was straight up no hero to stop Ganon according to the WW backstory. That's the biggest wrench in the pre-flood theory.
308879,"So they'd forget that a Hero stopped Ganon, something incredibly significant? And then this would mean even after you succeed in BoTW, Ganon would come back again when there's no Link? Because the sages used the Triforce to ask the Gods to save Hyrule, the the Gods flooded it. I doubt the cause of the flood would be an inaccuracy in the History. If you have to change an entire backstory to a game to make your theory work then I think it's incredibly flawed."
312400,"Well, maybe they didn't use the triforce (I was actually thinking of TP when I thought the sages tried to stop Ganon), but they definitely prayed to the Goddesses to stop Ganon, and the world was flooded as a result.

But really, every game is flawed and has contradictions/inaccuracies, but the ENTIRE BACKSTORY being different just so you can make your theory work? Now that's fan-fiction tier head-canon at best."
313136,"Whatever, you're just as willfully blind if you won't even consider other options as plausible. I'm not saying that WW timeline -cannot- be the case, as there is some evidence to it, but there is also evidence for either of the other two timelines. Some of the evidence has to be just intentional references. I do know that TP has been emphasized as having a connection to BotW during development, and it's been hinted that there's relation to OoT as well- so WW timeline may indeed be disqualified if that's the case.

I'm just saying, don't be surprised if you're wrong. At the end of the day I have all my cards on the table, but you're putting all your eggs into one basket."
