EDIT: Personally I'm not sure what to think of this Link. Treehouse official reports that Link had been asleep for 100 years, but it's called the Shrine of Resurrection so I don't know. I want to believe it's the Link from the Hylia War, before Skyward Sword."

From there I believe it's the Old Man that started the process of Resurrection, and it's Princess Zelda speaking into your mind similarly to that of A Link to the Past."
