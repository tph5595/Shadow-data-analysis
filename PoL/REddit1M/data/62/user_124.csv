46337,"The Deku Tree is dead in every post-OoT timeline. I mean, there's the new tree, but the original is dead."
46937,"He's killed rather than sealed as in most games, but presumably that just means that he'd be reincarnated. The same thing happens in the child timeline - in Twilight Princess he is apparently killed, but then he pops up again in Four Swords Adventures thanks to being resurrected (it's the only game that doesn't feature the same Ganondorf who first appeared in Ocarina, as far as I know). Ganondorf can reincarnate just like Link and Zelda do, it's just that he's a wizard who doesn't usually die, so he doesn't usually reincarnate either.

That said, messing with Wind Waker's themes is dumb from a story-telling perspective, so I really doubt that any games set after Wind Waker will use Ganondorf, even though they technically could."
47439,"A Link to the Past's backstory has the Imprisoning War, where there was no hero/the hero failed and Ganondorf was sealed by sages instead. We have since learned that the Imprisoning War is the aftermath of Ocarina of Time, specifically when the Hero of Time fails or possibly isn't present (my pet theory, since apparently one of the treehouse people called Link in BotW the Hero of Time, is that BotW takes place in the Fallen timeline, with the circumstance being that you didn't wake from your seven-year sleep to stop Ganon, thus the Imprisoning War. 100 years later you wake up to redeem yourself). The point is that Ocarina of Time inserted a hero where there had previously been none. Breath of the Wild could do the same thing, and be about a hero defeating Ganon so the god's don't have to flood the world after all."
47535,"Technically the same mechanic since it's also a parallel map, but conceptually a different mechanic since OoT was time travel and LttP/LbW was parallel worlds."
47644,"&gt; I don't believe Nintendo is able to create a whole new overworld

Except for the [three times](http://zeldawiki.org/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Ocarina_of_Time) [they've done](http://zeldawiki.org/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past) [it before.](http://zeldawiki.org/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_Between_Worlds)"
47867,"Link has been asleep for 100 years. Also, one of the presenters called him the Hero of Time."
48292,"I agree, and honestly I think that that's how the games started out and maybe even how they still start out. It's also a great way to make games which stand on their own."
50319,"That's where the war part comes in, as I understand it."
51269,"Yeah, everything is pretty unclear right now - for example, a different presenter said that it took place 100 years after Twilight Princess. There's no information on when this takes place at all, really."
