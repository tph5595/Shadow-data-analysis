6000,"I noticed as well, however I'm fairly certain that the great plateau was moved from its original location near Hyrule Castle and Death Mountain, which is why everything is too far south and facing the complete opposite direction it should be facing (facing north instead of facing south).

The walls of the Great Plateau are artificial and resemble the walls of Sky Keep from Skyward Sword, which the Temple of Time was eventually built on top of.  The Great Plateau may even be floating in the air, which explains the clouds surrounding its base.

Here are my thoughts on what happened 100 years ago:

The Hero of Time fought Ganon and lost.  Ganon obtained the full triforce and became a god-like being.  Ganon ravaged the land and the Sheikah emerged from hiding to confront him.  Their guardians rose from the ground, but Ganon was able to take control of them.  With no other options, Zelda used the power of Hylia to keep Ganon trapped in Hyrule Castle.  The Sheikah sealed Link in a healing chamber in a cave near the Temple of Time, then moved the Temple of Time and surrounding land with Sky Keep to keep it out of Ganon's reach.

100 years have passed and Zelda is beginning to lose the battle.  Link is awoken from his slumber and sets out on a quest to activate Sheikah technology that can be used to weaken Ganon and allow him to be sealed completely.

Aonuma pretty much hinted that this game is 100 years after OoT, and Fallen Hero is the only timeline left where that can happen.  It's also the only timeline with a Fallen Hero and BotW clearly stars a Fallen Hero.  The various references to OoT, WW, and TP all make sense if this is in the same era as WW and TP but in the Fallen Hero timeline."

For all we know Koroks are a more natural form for them and they only took on the Kokiri form for Link's sake.  Ganon causing the destruction of the land is just as much of a reason to become Koroks as the flood, as being able to fly would aid in reforesting the land."

It's more likely, being magical forest spirits, they can change their form however they want or need."

*At a group Q&amp;A with reporters on Sunday, Zelda producer Eiji Aonuma was asked where the game fit into the franchise timeline. Aonuma said he didn’t want to say much about the story at the moment but said he’d stare a hint. He noted that that the t-shirt he was wearing showed the symbol for the Sheikah stones and that it was the same one from The Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time. (In Breath of the Wild, the reawakened Link uses a high-tech item called the “Sheikah slate”). Aonuma also reminded people that, at the start of this game, Link is told he’s been asleep for 100 years. “He teased: “You can decide what this means.”*

When asked where in the timeline the game takes place, Aonuma said he'd give a hint and then mentioned OoT and that Link has been asleep 100 years.  These two details wouldn't mean anything by themselves because they are obvious, but mentioning them together has strong implications.
