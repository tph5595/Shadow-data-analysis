4265,"Hell, I thought about this when I first saw the Temple of Time surrounded by ruins, but your screenshots pretty much prove it.  The wall, leading to that walkway, with a few buildings between it and a fountain, followed up by the Temple of Time after the fountain... that's *way* too accurate to just coincidence, and that's awesome as hell.  Good work."
