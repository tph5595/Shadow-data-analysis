53752,Okay... all this has convinced me to be open to the idea! This is really interesting.
54096,"Man, videogame evolution is weird. 

But it's fun!"
55577,"Why do you not think it could be a hundred years after OoT and before subsequent games in any of those timelines? The temple is already in a state of decay so it could be heading towards the rotted down fate it has in TP, there are ruins of the temple that you find the Master Sword in in ALttP, and the ruins we see in BotW could have easily been torn down and built over before WW."
56484,I found Linebeck annoying in the beginning but he definitely grew on me.

This made me laugh pretty hard for some reason"
58678,"Hmm. I guess I just think that as often as Ganon/Ganondorf has come back to ruin the day and then been defeated/sealed again I don't see why this still couldn't take place in the between times of OoT and ALttP/TP/WW. 

Not to mention, this Calamity Ganon seems to be more akin to a force of nature and non-corporeal spirit. It seems like it could be the malevolent form broken free of whatever place he was bound. And since Link is revived/awoken/resurrected/whatever just to take him out, this could be the actual process of sealing him away so he's in a spot to break free in any of those timelines.

I just see such good arguments for any and all of these options. This one is going to be driving me nuts until we get an official word on where it is placed."
63803,Do you have any screenshots or know where to find them of Calamity Ganon looking porky? I've seen people mention it but to me he just looks like a giant armored smoky dude. 
63844,Agreed. I'm hard pressed to find a Zelda game with awful music though 
67655,"Oh yeah! Wow that's a good shot, thanks. I can see it now."
131164,"Well it could be. Even though it was pointed out to me, it still looks like [Phantom Ganon](http://zeldawiki.org/Phantom_Ganon) from Wind Waker. I can't wait to get a better look at him and learn more."
149452,Jesus that's more like a maw
