I think this game is going to merge all of the timelines together. I think we are going to see little references to every Zelda game, maybe ruins of Castle Town here, some remnants of Clock Town there. Maybe they'll even recreate the original games overworld and plop it in there, it would take a good eye to notice and would be a very cool thing for them to do. "
