50676,"I actually really like this take on the series - that the games are living legends instead of all 100% true.

Each game seems to have been made as a standalone game using similar themes/elements as the previous games, with the overall chronology only applied as an afterthought or vague idea (even with direct sequels). This means that even with the Hyrule Historia timeline, it is difficult to reconcile the inconsistencies between the games because each one seems to tell a relatively insulated story, instead of one as part of a larger arc.

But if we view each game as part of a legacy of legendary tales told over many millennia, all of the inconsistencies actually bolster the mythos of the Hero ~~of Time~~ and therefore the overarching story. It allows each game to be relatively independent, but to also contribute to the overall legend of Link.

It also reinforces the idea of the Hero ~~of Time~~ being an immutable, ever-present force of good against the great evils of Hyrule. Link becomes a larger than life figure in the minds of everyone who hears the stories. He's a man capable of traversing Hyrule Field in mere minutes, of wielding an unbreakable legendary sword, or even capable of bending nature itself to his will using magical instruments.

I guess this means that the Hyrule Historia official timeline is a historian's attempt at picking out the thread of truth within the myths of each game - in much the same way as we try to piece together our own history from books like Homer's Odyssey. 

I guess this has never occurred to me (and maybe others) before, because in Zelda, each game is presented in a different way from other games such as The Elder Scrolls. Instead of being presented as myths or legends, each Zelda game presents it's own story as the plain and simple truth.

TL:DR - Expanding on /u/Cillendor's idea - each Zelda game is a livable legend, which creates an overall mythology similar to real mythologies from different cultures."

I was sort of using the term as ""The Hero who reappears/is reincarnated continually throughout time"", but I'll edit the post to be a bit clearer. I don't think this point really harms the overall theory, though."
