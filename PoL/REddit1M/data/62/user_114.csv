42977,"I don't think people are taking into the account that Link is specifically awakening from a Resurrection Chamber. 

It is entirely likely that this could be a direct sequel to OoT in the Decline timeline. 
Link was defeated, placed into this chamber to preserve him and the sages sealed Ganon in Hyrule Castle. "
44451,"This is pretty well in line with what we know about the Zelda timeline.

The Temple of Time was built upon the Sealed Grounds, which was where the first settlements on the surface were rebuilt by the residents of Skyloft who decided to stay on the surface. So that by extension, with what the Old Man tells you; does make the plateau the birth place of Hyrule. 

The castle as well as the town would stand there until the events of Ocarina of Time; when the town and castle were utterly destroyed. 

So they rebuilt the castle in a more central region of Hyrule, which is what we see in all three of the timeline splits, as well as in Breath of the Wild. "
49170,"How so? This wouldn't be another hero, but yet another continuation of an existing one. For all we know, BotW could be a retcon/continuation of the events of the imprisoning war; which was the back story of Link to the Past. This would still be in line with that plot, and actual be the consequences of those events. 

Not to mention; the Master Sword being in the lost woods; and not in or near the Temple of Time. Which would link the events of BotW more closely to the Decline Timeline than to any other. 

I'm thinking about this in terms of what we have already been told about the background lore of Zelda; and not making up an excuse to drain the Great Sea to arbitrarily place it at the most recent end of the Adult timeline, or to place it ahead of the great flood.

Link in BotW is very clearly meant to be a hero from a previous time, brought back from ""death"" at a later point in history after being in a Resurrection chamber for specifically 100 years. That in of itself has to be relevant; and it being a Wind Waker sequel wouldn't be consistent at all with the dialogue in the E3 demo. "
50219,"Probably. It could definitely be a case of the dev team just putting in familiar Zelda elements with no regard to how they could be misconstrued and misinterpreted; which has happened in every single game that has come out since LttP. 
I certainly feel that the Koroks are that way. I think of them as just an extension of the Kokiri; just one of the races of Hyrule that have appeared in one form or another across the timeline splits. Like the Gorons and Zoras have. Why they are used as the lynch pin for an alleged Wind Waker connection is beyond me. 


It's been less than a week and the constant streams of ""theories"" are killing me. Most of them are just fan-fiction, and don't really address what is actually shown in the game. Just ""hey this would be cool and also explain MY idea"" kind of things. "
75611,"What are you talking about? You must be confused, because the original Castle town is long gone in Twilight Princess. Remember, the original castle was built around the Temple of Time; and in Twilight Princess the Temple of Time is completely demolished with not a building in site nearby. 

The centralized Castle town in Twilight Princess was built after the events of Ocarina of Time."
77626,"We know that things like forests and bodies of water have shifted over time in the Zelda series. Look at Lananyru province in Skyward Sword; at that time it was a vast desert which was the remains of a seabed. By the time OoT takes place, it had become the region where Lake Hylia is today. 

It could very well be the case that the ruins of Castle town in Breath of the Wild are within a centuries time of the calamity Ganon caused, and could be before Twilight Princess, as we see how close the forest is already. Within a few centuries a forest could very well cover that area."
79530,"I still support it being a Decline timeline game. 

And I heard it was 200 years after OoT? Regardless, I definitely don't think it takes place before Twilight Princess.  "
81097,That is my hunch as well. The general idea could fit within the imprisoning war very well.
