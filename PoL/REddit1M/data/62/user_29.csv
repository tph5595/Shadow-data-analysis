10835,"Here's a joke for you: Why can't Trump build the wall himself?

Because his hands are too small.

Here's another: Trump walks into a German deli and orders some bratwurst sausages. When the butcher asks if he wants anything else, Trump says ""yeah, I'll have some brockwurst, bierwurst, beutelwurst, gelbwurst, and some liverwurst"". The butcher complies and Trump leaves the store. The butcher then turns to his wife and says ""Wow, turns out he only knows the wurst words!"".

Another: a the_donald subscriber walks into a bar but is denied service. When they ask why, the bartender says ""we don't serve children""

One last joke for you: Donald Trump.

And your country hasn't voted yet lol.

It was the joke where I called the_donald children that hurt you the most, wasn't it lol."
