8953,"There's a theory that in TP, the original Hyrule Castle and Castle Town was abandoned due to damage after the great war that occurred with Ganon losing (because the Sacred Realm was never opened by child Link, and thus no Triforce power; and being executed in story form in TP) and a new castle and castle town was built at current location in TP. Evidence of construction is seen at the beginning of the game when Wolf Link is jumping around the scaffolding. 

The explanation of the old Castle Town and Temple of Time being located where it is near the the woods is that in the game, the Lost Woods had an open portal to the old castle town location. We already know the Lost Woods can open portals to random places... ie. Zora's Domain, Goron City, Termina... but then again even with the official timeline released... there's still so much missing information to link the games together."
