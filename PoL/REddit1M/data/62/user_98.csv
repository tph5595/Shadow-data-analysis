I'm betting on the ocean being literally uninhabitable though. The rains were meant to wipe away anything and everything. There's not even any fish to catch - only monsters and that single weird fish guy who follows Link around inhabit the Great Ocean.

So, the Zora would have died along with everyone else had they not changed, despite being water-dwelling creatures."

Also, those are two great games. Spirit Tracks far more than Phantom Hourglass, but Phantom Hourglass is still great. Both have two of the absolute *best* companions in the series. Linebeck is a really good character, is integral to the story, and isn't annoying. He has a full character arc, from starting off as a greedy coward, to becoming a greedy guy with a bit of courage in the end. It's nice. Zelda in ST, however, is just...*great*. She starts off as a whiny, bitchy princess who's sort of stuck with you, and yet her and Link bond throughout the game as they travel together, and she develops into a great character with honorable values and a sense of humility. Plus she's actually useful, and does shit to help Link in big ways."
