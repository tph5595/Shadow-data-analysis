33496,"I don't pop into this sub that often, so let me know if I'm in the minority: I think it was a big creative mistake to publish an official Zelda timeline.

As much as I dislike the term, my ""head-canon"" is that each Zelda game is a variation/retelling of a Hylian myth with set archetypes. So just like depictions of Jesus take on characteristics of the people creating them, retellings of the Hero's Legend change based on the people telling them. Why wouldn't a seafaring people have a seafaring Link, for instance?


Now that they've made it official, every game has to fit in this (complicated) timeline which I would think creatively hamstrings the series moving forward.

I'd much prefer things like this if was just fan theory/easter egg type stuff."

I don't find it annoying ;)"
