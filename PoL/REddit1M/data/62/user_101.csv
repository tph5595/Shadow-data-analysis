* the rito  **evolved** from the zora, that doesnt just happen within a hundred years.

* No one knows of OldHyrule in TWW, with a mere hundred years the flooding of hyruke shouldnt be a legend but an event with eyewitnesses, some maybe still alive.

This could be explained as a gameplay mechanic bur I dont rhink thats whats going on, I believe it is a new Link."
