47888,"Between OoT and ALttP?

The events of ALttP are a direct consequence of Ganon taking hold of the Sacred Realm in OoT. I believe having another hero between the two would screw the timeline"
49818,"&gt; How so? This wouldn't be another hero, but yet another continuation of an existing one. For all we know, BotW could be a retcon/continuation of the events of the imprisoning war;

Maybe it could. In ALttP we are led to believe that it is the first time Ganon is trying to take Hyrule after turning the Sacred Realm into the Dark World. But maybe he could've tried it before, being stopped by BotW Link.

But i'm still skeptical of it just as much as the other theories. There is a hole to be explained about the Sheika stuff and the Koroks. But every theory has similar blank pages.

Nintendo probably did this on purpose."

I believe the conjecture of having the defeated OoTs Link put into a chamber by the Sages is less far fetched than the other theories. The other would either require the new Link to not be a hero, or to it be born and immediately put to rest on the chamber for 100 years."
