32341,Tbh that would annoy me for the most part. It's an old trick that's been done several times already and it's unnecessarily complicated at the same time cutting corners
43816,"Instead of making a new area, we'll just re-use assets and use the same overworld to expand the game and invent some bs overused plot device to justify it all. 

It worked with aLttP because it was unique. It worked for OoT because it wasn't stale yet. It sort of worked for TP because they only went half-way with the concept (had they did the same thing, it would have been ""old and stale""). If BotW has the same dark world/old world time travel mechanic going on, they better execute it in a fantastic manner or I call BS. They're going for a large world, I don't think they'll do it anyway.

46292,"Saying I have no clue what it takes shows you have no clue how to talk to a human being. 

By reusing assets, i mean the overworld. That's an asset. That would be reused. 

Saying my argument is silly is insubstantial. It's cutting corners to give the perception of an expanded world. It's not bad per se, but it shouldn't be used in place of an actually expanded world, if possible. From a design perspective, it's cutting corners. "
49083,"OP mentioned nothing about time shift stones, only flipping between the past and present/datk world like OoT or aLttP. I maintain that going that route, from a literary perspective, in historical gaming context, and design, would be unwise. 

It just sounds like you want something to argue about. I'm done. "
