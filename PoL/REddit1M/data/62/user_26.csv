11995,"I'm more concerned with the fact that they haven't appeared in other games. I'm not saying it's impossible to find Koroks elsewhere, but, without having seen them anywhere else yet I'm placing my bets on the Wind Waker timeline."
12237,"The [Koroks](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Korok) aren't enemies, they're a race of creatures, and in breath of the wild they appear to be hidden NPCs.

I'm not saying that it's definitive, but it's definitely indicative."
13811,"Is that the wii version or the gamecube version, because one was flipped because of the introduction of motion controls, remember? If we assume that the map is flipped we can align the OoT map with the TP map by the Temple of Time and Death Mountain. I tried, but gimp is being upset at me for some reason."
14317,"The rusted out master sword is a good point, but I'm still thinking it's part of the WW timeline. I'm starting to think that the Breath of the wild might be later in time than we thought. I'm starting to think that it's part of the wind waker time line, but after the flood waters recede (so, after all the current games in that line). In Wind Waker, the Temple of Time and Hyrule castle were in perfect working order. The master sword was pristine. If BotW is before WW, then all those things would have to be restored before Wind Waker's flood (Or by the king, all by his lonesome). It would be weird though that all these ruins are still in reasonable shape, considering they were underwater for hundreds of years."
