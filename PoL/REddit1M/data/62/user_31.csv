Unless they moved the Temple of Time, it doesn't fit with the distance with Old Kakariko (assuming they mean this is the location of Kakariko from OoT which doesn't make sense to me because it is now in the wrong position to Death Mountain and Kakariko Village is in the correct placement)

I think your interpretation of the OoT map with BotW is completely spot on. My take on it is that BotW is sometime after WW which explains the Koroks, who were a result of the flooding."

51193,It's been a while since I've played TP but it looked like Renado's building used to be a windmill too!
