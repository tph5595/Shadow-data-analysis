64501,Nice attention to detail there OP!
64881,while possible i don't think the Temple of Time would be in ruins if there was still a bustling active town right next to it.
65180,"That would also fit in line with the adult timeline, with original hyrule castle and town destroyed they built the other one visited in WW and its surrounding geography doesn't match OoT's hyrule castle. Failed timeline is also still possible since Hyrule castle and town where still destroyed there as well but it definitely removes child timeline where the original castle and town remained untouched and were later expanded upon by the time Twilight Princess occurs."
65301,While i would love for them to reconcile the timelines back into one and remove the time paradoxes they've created it's too early to say other people are wrong just because this is the outcome you want. I don't mean to sound like an ass or dismissive just maybe instead of calling other people wrong when you have no proof for your own theory just say this is ur opinion/hope.
65908,"The main reason is probably that the adult and downfall timelines are where hyrule castle and castle town were destroyed by ganondorf. in the child timeline link left with the ocarina of time preventing ganondorf from entering the sacred realm. Even though a war still ensued without that power ganondorf couldn't destroy hyrule castle &amp; town like he did in the other two timelines. the original hyrule castle &amp; town were eventually abandoned i think simply due to how different Twilight Princess' geography is from OoT but TP places the ruins of the temple of time deep in a forest, while the great plateau has a small forest it's not surrounding the ruined temple of time."
66457,Numerous castles isn't really new if you compare the geography of the games after OoT on the time line they all moved. In Windwaker when you go to hyrule castle under the ocean the surrounding geography is completely different from OoT and no sign of a temple of time. In Twilight princess the Temple of Time is deep within the sacred grove surrounded by a forest in the southeast and castle town is much further north from that location also north of lake hylia. And in A Link to the Past once more there is no Temple of Time but the master sword itself is found in the forest to the northwest of Hyrule castle in a pedestal very similar to OoT and TP so in LttP after hyrule castles destruction the people relocated to the southeast leaving temple of time and the ruins of castle town to be over taken by nature creating a new forest eventually.
66496,"Only obtainable by using the Wolf Link amiibo from twilight princess, if you dont have the amiibo wolf link does not appear in the game."
66663,"if they implemented any time travel it would have to be limited to small areas, the world is too big to have 2 of them for the WiiU. The Plateau could be just right but i doubt it based on the key to traveling through time in OoT was the master sword being placed back in its pedestal in the temple of time and where that pedestal use to be there is now a set of statues. "
66860,You make some good points in my opinion this game can still fall in either the adult or downfall timelines we don't have enough facts to go either way yet. But i think there has been enough info shown to rule out the Child Timeline at least.
66879,I'm doing the same lol
66979,That will only be possible if it falls on the child timeline. hyrule castle was completely destroyed with not even ruins left behind after OoT in both the adult and downfall timelines.
67238,"While i do agree that the timeline is a bit of an issue the time paradox of the Downfall Timeline especially makes my brain hurt. But as far as limiting the dev team after they revealed the timeline with skyward sword Aonuma was asked how the timeline influences each games creation to which Aonuma said they focus on making the game first and then decide later where it fits on the timeline, in the case of skyward sword they wanted to focus on telling the story of the master swords creation and the curse of demise that is the cause of these cycles of ganon/demise, zelda and link always being reincarnated so it was a natural fit to make it the earliest game in the series. Even if the timeline hadn't been revealed and remained a top secret nintendo document that wouldn't change anything about the way the games are made."
67365,"A theory has already popped up that this might be a new failed timeline for WW where ganon did make his wish with the triforce to drain the oceans, link was defeated and mirroring OoT we was put to sleep until he would be strong enough to stop ganon lol."
67447,"Im pretty sure that's they're plan, thats why they went so far as to completely avoid any towns and npc's that might have lore spoiling info we only see the old man and he doesn't provided any info vital to figuring out where on the timeline this game occurs."
67609,"I'm still against this idea because BotW link has brown hair and OoT link had blonde, artstyle changes don't mean much in the series but physical traits like hair color and what hand link holds his sword on still matter i think."
68153,Negative it can't possible fall in that spot due to ganon being imprisoned in the land of twilight after OoT's child link ending. Ganon doesn't return until TP happens. Right now it's still more likely to happen in the Adult or Downfall timelines.
69168,"I've rewatched the Day 1 &amp; 2 footage three times, on the 3rd time i was specifically looking for these same details other people said where mentioned i never once heard anyone say link was asleep for 100 years or call him the hero of time, they only called him link throughout all the gameplay demos. Can you provide a video source of when these two lines were said?"
69697,"The world is way to big for that, having to explore two games of that size would be absolutely ridiculous."
70008,It has to take place after due to the ruins of the Temple of Time. The last time the Temple of Time is seen whole is in OoT so for it to be in ruins we must be AFTER OoT.
70251,I still have reservations about links hair and right handed nature. Which both conflict with OoT Link who had blonde hair and was left handed.
70530,"Calamity Ganon was already confirmed on Day 1, Aonuma even said it's possible to head straight to his castle and attempt to beat him right at the start of the game. He is the final boss he's just not the focus of the story which is figuring out who this link is, why he was asleep and why he was revived now."
76385,It would still require the developers to have 2 completely different versions of their entire world.
76542,You are 100% correct i realized this too as i went down the thread making other comments and remembered the temple of time is clearly in faron woods. it still fits with keeping BotW out of the child timeline though since the ruins of ToT and Castle town are completely over grown in the middle of a forest in TP and we only see a small forest off to the northwest in BotW.
79048,"The location of the temple of time ruins being to the southwest of death mountian would fit with TP's geography too. It's something to consider as we find more clues at least. The biggest obstacle to BotW being between MM and TP would be Aonuma himself saying TP takes place around only 100 years after OoT, thats not enough of a gap to slip another game in."
80216,"That 200 year thing is a major rumor. Aonuma only gave 2 clues as to when the game takes place in the timeline: First he said the Shiekah symbol on his BotW shirt is the same as the one from OoT. Second he said link has been asleep for 100 years. That is the only clues he gave us.

I agree though, with what we have seen i don't see this falling in the child timeline at all, my money is still on Adult timeline Post-WW but Downfall timeline is still a possibility too. It is possible they're retconing the sealing war just like they retconed it for LttP's backstory for the gameboy advance version after OoT. But that's an assumption for now based on more solid facts i still say Post-WW."
142942,I wish they would release a non-motion control version of skyward sword.
143220,I would be completely behind that idea instead of having a whole 2nd massive world.
224244,"Ah i missed that line, in that case i'll strike it off my list of details. This still leaves his brown hair conflicting with OoT Links blonde hair."
