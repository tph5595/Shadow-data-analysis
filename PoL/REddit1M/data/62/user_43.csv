15266,"There's actually a theory that supports yours that I saw on Youtube just days before E3 that I dug up after a recent playthrough of Twilight Princess, which I never particularly cared for on release.  I found a brand new appreciation for it once Hyrule Historia came out and I saw it's canonical placement in the big picture, especially considering my biggest gripe with TP was that it seemed completely disconnected from the rest of the series.

I was skeptical watching this at first, I try not to get too involved with 22 minute speculative theory videos (and sure, there's a fair bit of embellishment going on) but Macintyre's points won me over. Seems crazy relevant now, especially with all these screenshots.

If anyone is interested to see what might have happened to the Temple of Time, Hyrule Castle, the sacred grove, the fountain, the hero of time, the Sheikah, as well as Hyrule in general leading up from the end of Ocarina of Time to Twilight Princess, it's an excellent little video to fuel speculation.

tl;dw &gt; Link warns the royal family of Ganondorf's plot, all out war, the castle is destroyed, Impa creates a town for refugees (TP's Kakariko village), the knight's of hyrule train in snowpeak, the Gerudo are executed in the arbiter's grounds, the hero of time leaves stones to pass his legacy on to the new hero.  Just crazy stuff."
