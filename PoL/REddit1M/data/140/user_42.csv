275397,Is there any new areas to explore in the new DLC? I was watching a stream and the one hit thing doesn't really look like something I'd have fun with. 
291156,That's disappointing. I probably won't even bother trying it then. Thanks for the answer.
291292,I thought the dungeons were the weakest part about the game and the exploration of the world the best. That's why I was hoping for a new area. Thanks for the reply.
