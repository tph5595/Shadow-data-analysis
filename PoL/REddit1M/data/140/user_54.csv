295106,"So, I have the game on Wii U but acquired a Switch a few months ago. Is it worth reading in my Wii U copy for a Switch copy? One of my biggest issues is how often the frames go down and stay at 20 still even in the Wii U. (To the point it's killed my desire to play.) how significant is the difference with the Switch version? (Also, the motion controls feel nice on the Switch.)"

Thanks for the help! :)"
