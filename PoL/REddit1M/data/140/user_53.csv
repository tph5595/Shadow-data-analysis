290975,"Trial of the Sword is in the Korok Forest, just put the Master Sword back in its pedestal. 

The Champions' Ballad becomes available as soon as you free the fourth divine beast. You will then be prompted to return to the shrine of resurrection."

291039,"No, hard mode hasn't changed. 
If you need a Zelda fix right now, just spin up your old normal save and play the DLC."
291076,"1) Yes. We've been promised a full new dungeon since March.
2) No idea, not there yet."
291103,"You must have missed a monster or two. Some are at high vantage points. One of them requires you to defeat a stationary guardian.

291129,There is a complete dungeon similar to the divine beasts.
291217,"I've heard someone say 16 shrines (I know there are at least 12), and one big dungeon. Took me ~2.5 hours to clear seven of those, that's where I'm at."
291396,"Assuming you still haven't beat Ganon, I strongly suggest giving the Trial of the Sword and the new DLC a try before fighting him. 
Of course, if you already beat him, no harm done, those other challenges are still amazing.
After you beat Ganon, the game will just reload right in front of the fight."

367314,"The bonus items from past Zelda games certainly look neat, but are outclassed by those available without DLC after you upgrade them at fairy fountains. 
However, both the Trial of the Sword and the Champions' Ballad are outstanding (and mid-to-late game challenges).
I'd say it is better to start with the DLC installed than to not have it."
