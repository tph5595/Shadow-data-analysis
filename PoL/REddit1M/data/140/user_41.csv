274973,"I’m doing the Champions Ballad. Almost done with the 4 shrines. I swear I’ve killed every single monster in the forest of spirits, yet that shrine refuses to show up. Anyone know wtf? What am I missing? I’ve done an entire perimeter search of the forest and there’s nothing else there. Is it a chu maybe? That I can’t see and will pop out of the ground when I trigger it? I need a nap, this is so frustrating..."
281446,"Huh. Are we having the same issue? I was able to get 3/4 shrines to appear and I activated and completed them with no tech issues, but this last one in the forest of spirits won’t appear, period. So there’s no activating it at all so your fix won’t work unfortunately :( It’s either that I’m missing an enemy to defeat or it’s a bug and my killing the last enemy didn’t trigger the shrine to appear. I have mixed feelings over both."

320867,Good God. Thank you. That was insane. I’m kicking myself for not finding that on my own.
