328652,"I used the two weaker spears in the first phase where it's less crucial to take advantage of every opening. Saved my arrows for the second phase where I climbed onto a cryonis block and jumped off for three slow-mo arrow shots at a time to the eye, which would make him fall down so I could hit him. Did this 3 times.

You can also stand on top of a cryonis block close to him and hit him in the eye with a spear.

But yeah, on master mode it's easy to mess this up and have him regen too much health. Took me a couple tries."

The framerate tanks way more often on Wii U, to the point where I feel like the Switch version is a significantly better experience overall. That + the ability to suspend/resume the game practically instantly at any time is a gamechanger. Bonus points if you value portability at all."

When he has his big fire forcefield thing up you can just throw a bomb and he sucks it up like king dodongo, then when you detonate it's gone for the rest of the fight."
