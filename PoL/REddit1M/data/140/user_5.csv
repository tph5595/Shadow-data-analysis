There is a trick to fighting them by [using a perfect shield parry to reflect their laser beam back at them](/spoiler). The other enemies could be some of the sub-bosses. If you can remember the name I could offer some tricks on fighting them.

Remember that BOTW is open world. There are areas that will be too hard for early game. Some areas are naturally harder than others but you shouldn't have to worry too much if you need to avoid a few fights."

Personally, I had no problems playing the game after defeating Ganon. It didn't feel any different. I collected all of the Koroks, did all of the Shrines, got the map to 100%, completed Compendium, etc..."

Dragon horn farming requires a lot more resources to do efficiently. You will need the Rubber armor leveled to 2 stars, a golden/phrenic bow, and a flame weapon."
