251837,I’m currently trying to activate the Central Tower in BOTW. I’ve tried using a Perfect Parry to destroy one of the Decayed Guardians around the tower but the beam keeps deflecting away instead of striking it back. Any tips on how to kill them/activate the tower through other means?
273067,Worked like a charm. Thank you so much!
