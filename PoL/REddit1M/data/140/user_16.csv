The first expansion comes with a handful of new side missions that unlock pretty cool rewards such as a teleportation pad, majoras mask, korok mask and more. The biggest part of the DLC is the trial of the sword, by completing  a trial your master sword will receive 10 extra damage. At the end of all three trials you will have a 60 dmg master sword with something like 180 durability, don't quote me on that, and the sword will glow like it does in hyrule castle or against guardians.

The trial of the sword is fun and challenging even on normal mode, and the heros path is very helpful when exploring the map post game. Also little things like the korok mask and Majoras mask make exploring easier. "
