10547,"So I’ve been playing through Majora’s Mask 3D, haven’t played the game since I was much younger. My question is how many of you agree that Kafei is Links Termina counterpart? 
I know the theory has been tossed around before and is usually debunked since he’s the only counterpart who doesn’t use the same character model from Hyrule. I think that from a gameplay mechanic it wouldn’t make much sense to have a link clone but they do have many similarities:

1.) their hair part is the same, Links is just shorter and blonde. 
2.) if I remember correctly Kafei is the only human character whose model did not appear in OoT. 
3.) Kafei is an adult turned child when Link was a child turned adult. 
4.) Kafei is the only other character you assume control over during the majora’s mask play though (not counting mask spirits.)"
10595,Sorry didn’t see the BotW headline until after I posted. Thought it was general Zelda. I apologize!
11978,I got that impression too! It was funny how Yuga was working with Hilda and Ravio was a coward lmao it’s all completely backwards.
