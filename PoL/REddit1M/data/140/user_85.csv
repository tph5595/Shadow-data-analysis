374382,"**BotW** 100%-ing question:
____________________________________________________
Can I use a map like for the korok seeds, which I just finished getting, to get the rest of the locations I'm missing?

Someone posted this online which is the discoverable locations I guess. Will these just not have a name if I haven't discovered them yet and thus can use this map to finish off the 100%?

482500,"Yeah I just realized that yesterday about the DLC adding more map locations/shrines. Those may be what I'm ""missing"" now so I feel better. Now I can just enjoy the DLC :) Finally fought Ganon the other night after hundreds of hours of playing since the March launch. I just got so into it that I wanted to do everything before I finished the main game. I'm weird like that. It's been so satisfying doing literally everything. Now I just have to beat all the DLC and get the new items and then finish upgrading literally all my clothes lol. I swear, I've gotten more value out of BotW than from any single player game ever.
