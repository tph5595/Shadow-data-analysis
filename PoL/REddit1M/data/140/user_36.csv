After you help the gerudo jewelry ladies, if you talk to the assistant, she says, oh, man. I'm so grateful that you helped us out. I feel like I should do something nice for you. Here's a secret. The main jewelry shop lady sleeps wearing nothing but jewelry!

I read that and I was like, uh, what am I supposed to do with that information? Thanks for thinking I am a tiny perv who wants to sneak up on naked ladies in their sleep, jewelry shop assistant."
