440330,link to the past - i have just beaten the eastern palace and need to get into desert palace. I have just found that the path is blocked by a statue. I have looked online at walkthroughs and discovered i need to get the book mudora and to get that i need to get the pegasus shoes. In game is there something I missed to tell me to do this? How would I have known this without wandering around aimlessly until I happened to find what i needed?
