377564,"Why would they add an armor limit? I’m currently working on the champions ballad dlc and I have everything but the royal guard armor, but as soon as I find a chest it turns out I can’t carry it. I have absolutely no duplicate armors so I wish I could carry them all but I guess not. Time to get rid of kiltons armors since I can at least buy those again if we ever get more space. It seems stupid to have a limit on armor. "
