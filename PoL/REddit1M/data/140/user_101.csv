473429,"So are there only like 3 different enemies in this game? I bought the game sinse it got hyped so much and people say its so fantastix but im a bit dissapointes. The exploration is cool but not rewarding at all. I only get shit out of all the chests and the dungeons are pretty easy and short. Maybe im just burned out on open world games but this map is so huge and the only things you can find are the exact same enemies and shrines,shrines and more shrines.... i liked majoras mask on the 3ds alot more"
