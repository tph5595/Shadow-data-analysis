275476,"Champion's Ballad question - I killed all the monsters at every base, no shrines ever appeared. Anyone else have this bug? Am I missing something?"
276770,"I have the same bug!!! When I'm not in the quest, I can see them but can't go in. Then when I start the quest and pick up the obliterater, they aren't there!"
277335,"I might have fixed it. Try activating all the shrines while the quest is inactive. Then completely shut off your switch. Reload your file, start the quest, see if the shrines are there"
281624,Did you find the gold bokoblin on the tree?
291897,No it was a bug that other redditors ran in too as well. Resetting my switch seemed to fix it and the shrines appeared
564602,"In my case it WAS a bug. I'd kill all the enemies, the game would play the combat finishing ""ding ding ding"" bell and then no cut scene for the shrine. If check the quest info in my menu and it would say that I had one less monster base to take out. After taking out all monsters at all 4 bases it said I had no more monster bases to complete but that I should now complete the shrines.... but still, no shrines had appeared. I left the plateau, thus cancelling the quest and then returned and guess what? The shrines were all magically there only problem is I couldn't enter them with the obliterater. I went back to the shrine of Resurrection, picked up the obliterater to begin the quest, went back out to the shrines and... they weren't there. Thanks for trying."
