**Do yourself a favor and play the game without internet guides or any other help, unless you get really stuck on a puzzle. The exploration is really what makes this game special. Follow your own path, don't worry about completing the main quest as quickly as possible, if you see something interesting in the distance, check it out.**
Most gameplay mechanics are explained well in-game, and experimentation is a lot of fun. Many shrines have multiple ways of solving puzzles, there is no right or wrong, (ab)use the physics engine as much as you want.


Save the internet guides for when you've beaten most of the game and are just looking to fill up some gaps if you want to get to 100% completion.


&gt; Hi I am new to the game and looking to 100% it. 

I highly recommend getting the DLC early on as there are some items and features in there that will make this goal easier, especially getting all 900 korok seeds.

&gt;Any recommendations for the path of least resistance? Should I power through the main story and then visit a bunch of shrines, or vice versa? 

Shrines give you hero orbs, each 4 orbs can be traded in for extra stamina or heart container. I'd recommend upgrading to 5-6 hearts so you don't get one-shotted by everything, and then focusing on maxing out stamina for running/climbing/swimming

You don't need to do all shrines per se, some will be hard to find, and towards the end of the game you'll be pretty strong so you won't need to worry about a few hearts more or less. 

There are 120 shrines (or more if you get the DLC pack), so even if you focus mostly on the main quest you are bound to come across plenty of them.

And by going for 100%, eventually you will see all of them.

&gt;Are there any powerful armor sets I can get my hands on early that make things smoother? 

All base armor in the game can be upgraded (not the DLC armor sets). The champions tunic you get early on can be upgraded the most, to 32 defense points. 


Armor sets can be pretty expensive early on though, and you will need heat and cold proof armor for some parts of the game (or make a ton of potions to make you heat/cold resistant). Other armor sets will improve attack, improve your sneaking ability, improve swimming etc. They all have their usefulness, but really depends on how you want to play this game.

&gt;Is there any way to climb faster?

Yep, there is a special climbing set to be found.

&gt;Is getting access to horses extremely useful or not really useful? 

Horses can be found all over Hyrule, try and tame one and bring it to a stable, the rest of the horse mechanics are explained there.

In terms of usefulness, they are great when you want to travel quickly to places you haven't been yet, but to re-visit areas you've already explored, using fast travel points will probably be your main mode of transportation.

Also, when exploring areas you will likely abandon your horse at some point to climb up a mountain or cliff, or take a swim. Don't feel guilty, horses can be re-summoned at stables, or at will if you have a special item.

Also, selling off excess monster parts, especially bokoblin etc. you will have plenty of them later in the game and little use for them early on. Same for gems.

The extra DLC questline doesn't affect the main story until very late, so won't spoil much at all."
601968,"There are more enemies. Around 12 main types with a couple variations of each (e.g. red/blue/black/silver which are stronger, and fire/electric/ice for elemental type enemies), which comes to around 70 in total, excluding boss fights. 


The 3 enemies you are refering to (probably: bokoblins, lizalfos and moblins) are the most common."

602206,"Destroy the shooting ice blocks with cryonis (the ice power), then shoot arrows in his face so the Blight drops, then use your weapon on it.

Urbosas fury helps in taking off some HP. If you are out of arrows, throwing your weapon can work as a last resort."
