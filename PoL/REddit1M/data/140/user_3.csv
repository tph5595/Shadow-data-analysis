I notice that the enemies are more stronger and I usually deal only a minute damage to them, my strongest melee weapon is 46 points, health is 5 hearts. What am I doing wrong? Am I supposed to solve more shrines or clear more enemy camps for weapons?
And I sneak around those ancient things, too tough to take out."
