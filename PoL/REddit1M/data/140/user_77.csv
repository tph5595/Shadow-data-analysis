356768,I played through Master Quest and now on Ballad I’d The Champions. I cannot get trough Windblight Ganon for the life of me. He keeps regenerating! And my swords break. Fa. Any tips?
366704,Oh crap. I meant Thunderblight Ganon. Any tips for that dude? 
547013,Just did it. Flurries helped immensely. Not sure why I didn’t try that before.
