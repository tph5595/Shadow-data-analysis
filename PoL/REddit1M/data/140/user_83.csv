367487,"So, ever since the DLC including the Xenoblade Chronicles 2 costume (for The legend of ZeldaBrath of the wild for the WiiU) was released, I can't start the game because, according to a text box, there's an error with the Add-on content and I should delete and download it again. Now, this would not be a problem at all, if I was actually able to delete or move it. If I try to delete the Data or move it from my external memory(where I stored all the games data on) to the internal memory, it says that the data could not be deleted. Neither google nor the Nintendo support was able to help me with this problem. From what I researched, there is not going to be a way to only get my save data from the external memory, or delete the add-on content, without using some mods and homebrew. Can anyone recommend me mods or programms that allow me to either delete/edit data without the restrictions of the WiiU's data management, or just make a copy of the save data that I'll be able to inject into the memory of the WiiU? (I've heard of ""Saviine"", but if I understood correctly, it needs you to actually start the game, to make a copy of the saves, which I am not able to do"
