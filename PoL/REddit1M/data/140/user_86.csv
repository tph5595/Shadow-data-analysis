375207,What's master mode?
376469,"People are recommending playing the DLC before beating Ganon.

As someone who just finished up the fourth Divine Beast, why? Won't completing the Trial of the Sword make the castle battle way too easy for me?

Why should the DLC be played before the game is completed?"
