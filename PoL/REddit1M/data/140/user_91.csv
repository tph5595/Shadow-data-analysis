391714,"[BotW DLC2 Spoilers] So in Champion's Ballad...

How the flying fuck do you beat Waterblight in its second phase?"
541638,"Remember you can cook stuff to increase your attack power or defense before you arrive at the divine beast. Use kilton's monster extract while cooking so your buffs have a chance to last 30 minutes.

You're actually well equipped to fight thunderblight. He's the most aggressive one out of all the blights so he will come for you.

Flurry rush works best against him.

He usually flashes two times before hitting you. He will hit you in his third flash.

You just gotta time your jumps.

The second phase is more of the same. Use the metal rods against him and hit him while he's down.

Then again he will flash three times before hitting you, only this time his weapons will be electrified. Flurry rush will work here too.

I beat him first try on master mode without any buffs and I think only broke the two handed sword during the fight.

Good luck!"
