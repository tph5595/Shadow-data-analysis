289227,Seems like it’s just New shrines and memories re: 100 years ago to collect. Pretty lame imho
291376,"Yeah, I’m really disappointed. Was hoping for a new island or something to explore, ala Solstheim or Shivering Isles. Or maybe a tour of Hyrule w/ Zelda. It’s like Nintendo heard people complain that there was too much story in the past and not enough in the present, and too many samey shrines... and then decided we all wanted MORE past-story and more samey shrines.

Which, to be fair, is exactly as boneheaded as we’ve been conditioned to expect from Nintendo."
292598,"There is no post-Ganon progression, so it doesn't matter. After beating Ganon the game just send back in time to just before you fought him, like most(?) prior Zelda games."
292670,"Re:1, I've seen a clip of what looks like a cut-scene featuring Zelda, so she's either got her own special scene, or is included in one of the others."

Reloads and blood moons do not seem to have any effect."
326077,"More memories to collect, some (very minor) dialog w/ the bird-guy, and a bunch of new shrines and combat challenges.

If you're in it for the story, I don't think there's much reason to get it."
326115,Use xe.com and figure it out for yourself.

BotW is a fantastic game, and more of it is equally fantastic, but relative to the kinds of content that other games put out at similar price-points, it's a pretty big rip-off."
326280,"I played through most of the game on WiiU, and then picked up a Switch copy. I've encountered some slowdown at random, in combat, maybe three times in the last 20 hours of play. I'd say it's a pretty major improvement, so I'd definitely recommend grabbing a switch copy. Having a stable 30fps at towns and stables alone makes the game feel a *lot* better.

As for how the motion controls... well, they're the same as on WiiU. Joycons are definitely less comfortable than the WiiU gamepad, though."
