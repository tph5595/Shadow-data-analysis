313592,"I would certainly buy it if it allowed us to play as Zelda. At this point, I'm trying to think. Good things, I'll get Master Mode (should have been there in the beginning) and Sword Trails. Otherwise, I really don't care about a post game bike, playing dressup, and reused asset boss battles. 
FUUUU I waited so long too see what DLC2 was gonna be. Guessing what Nintendo is gonna do, if DLC 3 happens, they will do another insta-release during E3. In conclusion, MY SWITCH IS DUSTY, I NEEDED THIS DLC. "
