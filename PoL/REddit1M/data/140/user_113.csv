577422,"Hi I am new to the game and looking to 100% it. Any recommendations for the path of least resistance? Should I power through the main story and *then* visit a bunch of shrines, or vice versa? Are there any powerful armor sets I can get my hands on early that make things smoother? Is getting access to horses extremely useful or not really useful? Is there any way to climb faster?"
