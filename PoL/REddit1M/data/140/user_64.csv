I have no problem with phase 1, but I can't figure out how to hit him in phase 2 fast enough to kill him. I tried stasis-ing the ice blocks and hitting them back but it takes too long and uses up too much durability on my spears. Is there a better way to do it?"

Keep in mind, however, that DLC 1 adds master mode so if you wanted to complete a playthrough in master mode you'd need to purchase the DLC prior to starting."
