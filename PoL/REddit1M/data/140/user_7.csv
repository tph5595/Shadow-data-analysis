And yeah, more shrines so you can build up your hearts, lotta good loot in the shrines, so it's worth the time."

Did a circle starting with the stable there north to the shrine and followed the edge of the clifts counterclockwise. Tons of moose, wolves and rhinos(?) plus the occasional ores. Used up about 50 arrows and took in over $4000 in rupees"
