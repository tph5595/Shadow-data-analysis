The Rito elder tells you about Revali's journal. It's in Teba's house (next structure after the elder's). Riju tells you about Urbosa's diary. It's in Riju's room, on the arm of the couch when you first walk in. For anyone else reading this, Dorephan tells you about Mipha's diary. It's right in front of him."
