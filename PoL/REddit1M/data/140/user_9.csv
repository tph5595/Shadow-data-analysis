339563,"If you're following the ""EX The Champion's Ballad"" quest, you're doing the new story stuff."
339844,"The important bit is that the ring is in the line of the sun's reflection in the water, hence ""the light's path"""
339945,Just go to the location the pedestal leads you to and it'll be apparent immediately
398435,"Do you mean EX Memory 5? It takes place in the Sanctum, then outside at one of the structures near the entrance to the Sanctum"
398589,"&gt; This DLC is more than re-fighting each boss, right?

Yes"
398614,"No. Start the ""EX The Champion's Ballad"" quest."
398801,"&gt; Won't completing the Trial of the Sword make the castle battle way too easy for me?

491276,"Complete *The Hero's Sword* to access *EX Trial of the Sword.*

Complete *Free the Divine Beasts* to access *EX The Champions' Ballad.*

The rest of the EX quests can all be done immediately after *The Isolated Plateau,* and none require *Destroy Ganon.*"
562155,"Three - two new overworld bosses that are derivative of existing overworld bosses, and the new dungeon boss"
562312,"No, the entire point is that you figure out where they are on your map. Every image should have a recognizable landmark"
562369,The bike is the reward for completing *EX The Champions' Ballad.*
568494,"Apparently others have fixed this (Wii U-only?) bug by just quitting the software, then when they loaded the game back up everything was corrected. Try that?"
569136,"Ah, whoops. Good to know"
