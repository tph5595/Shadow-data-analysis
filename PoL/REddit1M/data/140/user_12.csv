These doors are very finicky. What I always do is roll the snowball around at the top of the hill. Don't throw it down the hill while it's still a tiny ball. Push it around, get it really big, then if you can still pick it up and throw it do that, otherwise, stasis hit it to the correct spot to hit the door.

Always check the path to make sure it's going to hit the door. "

563929,It isn't a bug. All of the enemies are there. Try whistling to find them. Sometimes bokoblins are sleeping in the grass and don't notice all of their friends are dead. Whistling will get enemies attention.
