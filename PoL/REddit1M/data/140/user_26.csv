Do food buffs and clothing buffs stack, and if so, how high?

If I equip two pieces of stealth clothing, then drink a potency 1 stealth potion, do I get stealth 3?

If I have all three pieces of the stealth set equipped, and I drink a potency 3 stealth potion, do I have stealth 6, or is that capped at 3?"

You'll find a lot of shrines along the way, as well as good gear and a lot of ingredients.  I found the game was significantly easier once I had around nine hearts and some armor upgrades under my belt.

This is a super hard game if you play fair.  So don't play fair!  Don't be afraid to run, or to sneak up on an enemy that's asleep, steal their weapon, and backstab 'em with it!  Or throw a bomb near 'em to knock 'em off a mountain!  Enemies hit hard.

Also, remember, you are Link, hero of legend, renowned far and wide for your immense and mighty talent for... cooking.  I'm not exaggerating when I say your cooking is literally more powerful than your swordsmanship.  Healing is a start, but also, attack or defense buffing food is REALLY powerful.  That said, if you're on Death Mountain, you'll need some form of fire resistance; if you upgrade that rocky-looking armor twice (gotta find two great fairy fountains by exploring the world to do that), the set grants fire immunity, freeing up your food buff for attack and defense when needed.

And guardians... are deliberately tough.  Shooting them in the eye can both stun them and interrupt them charging their laser.  You can smash their legs.  But you're going to need some really strong weapons to deal meaningful amounts of damage."
