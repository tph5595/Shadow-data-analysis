74563,"Goron city feels like more of a late game area.  First, you need to know how to get around, and everything on the paths seem tougher.  

Dodge the bigger enemies like the ancient guardians until late game.  I think they are meant to be too hard to fight with five hearts.

So...  Seek out more shrines! "
