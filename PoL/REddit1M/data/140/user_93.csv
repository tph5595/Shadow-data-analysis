394453,"The one hit challenge mechanic is _fucking awful_. I have never in my life been so mad at a game. I made it through the monster killing part by abusing saves (saved literally every time i killed a single monster or even made it from one hiding spot to the next), and I died _so many times_. Dying to the monsters isn't even as frustrating as dying the dumb things. _Everything_ kills you in one hit. You have to do the shrines that pop up with the one hit mechanic in place too. I'm stuck here for now. You can't save in shrines the way you can in the overworld, so that gimmick isn't getting me through it. 

I'm honestly furious at the game right now, and I don't know that I'll ever turn it on to give this another shot. Nothing about this setup is fun, it's just tedious and pointlessly brutal. "
