277169,"I just finished Daruk’s trail. I swear they said this game was going to be post-Ganon and there were some memories. I’m pretty disappointed in terms of story. However, I love dungeons in Zelda so all these shrine quests are making me pretty happy. I’m still going through the DLC so as little spoilers as possible 

1) is there more after finishing the 4 champions’ trials?

2) Will Zelda have her own cutscene focusing on her?

I’ll be honest, I’m really ambivalent about the 4 champions so I really wished we focused on Zelda, the character, instead. "
277250,So far? Prequel but in the current time. It’s basically shrines to get to more memories.

317362,DAMMIT! NINTENDO! UGH! I was hoping we'd see more of her and Link or her and her father's relationship in the cutscene for the new dungeon. Thanks for answering. Better to be disappointed now. 
326033,So I read that you can read the Champion's diary on twitter. Where do you find them? 
328491,I talked to Sidon and he told me to go the Mipha's trail area. Do I only read it after I complete the trail?
329104,"&gt;  complete joke and a ripoff.

no it isn't. You get new costumes, new combat trial, new shrine puzzles, new dungeon and new animated cutscenes. Do you think games are made by robots who don't need to get paid? How do you not see where your money is going to?

Btw, after reading up on how CD Projekt Red treats their employees, that DLC felt so dirty to me. 

OP, DLC is only worth it if you like the combat and puzzles. If you're in it for the story, it is not worth it at all. "
329260,I'll talk to him then! Thanks a lot 
387566,"Regarding Zelda DLC, can someone make a list of where to find all the journals? I got Mipha's. I'm looking for Daruk's. I talked to the elder and he didn't help and I'm trying to find Yunobo and I don't know where it is. Do you have to talk to the current champions/elders to activate the diary appearing?"
