77855,Link to the Past will probably always be my favorite.

Travelling the game world was more restrictive than previous zelda games, due to needing the boat to get anywhere.  The story was subpar compareed to others.  The combat was more evolutionary than evolutionary.  To be fair though, the only Zelda game I liked less than WW was the one with the train."

FWIW, I believe that Morrowind was much more expansive and involved than Wind Waker.  It would have my vote for being the best game in the last decade."
