65700,"I'd disagree with Bioshock. It was fun for a 2007 game but looking back on it, it had a shitty inventory system, boring-ass powers (especially when you compare it to powers you get in a game like Dishonored), a dumb respawn system, and the horror element was practically nonexistent in the game which is disappointing given it was touted as a spiritual successor to System Shock. I'd replace it with Halo or even GTA San Andreas in a heartbeat."
