21178,"&gt; It was least favorite Zelda game.

Someone better tell these guys TrojanX doesn't like the game; they're about to make a huge mistake!"
21392,"I haven't until now. It looks like a cool, quirky little game. I'm assuming it's a blast to play, considering it's your favorite?

My favorite game ever is [Jet Set Radio Future](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_Set_Radio_Future) - extremely innovative in gameplay, story, and style. But it'll never win shit; it's more of a ""cult hit""."
22160,"I loved the sailing aspect of the game. I could see what you mean about it ""breaking the flow"" if it felt like a hassle, but if you enjoyed it, you'd probably just see it as another part of the adventure (at least I never thought of it differently).

I love exploration, so finding islands felt awesome - I mean, I just discovered a whole new ""level"" out of the blue; a new little place with it's own stuff to do. The water was vast, so it actually felt like you were going on an *adventure* - like *you* were out there sailing the ocean, continuing your journey. It also added to the whole ""pirate"" theme of the game.

But of course all this is so subjective; I'm just giving my point of view. Some folks *hated* the cel-shaded graphics, and cel-shaded graphics are a **huge** selling point in **any** game for me, so there you go."
25298,"Because you said:

&gt; It was least favorite Zelda game.

as if that means anything. Re-read the comment you reply to:

&gt; I can see how, mechanically and visually, WW was a leap ahead and though it's not necessarily one of MY favorites it deserves to be on the list

He's saying his opinion is irrelevant because he can still see how it was a ""leap ahead"". You didn't get downvoted for your opinion, you got downvoted for completely missing the point of the contest *and* missing the point of the comment you replied to.

(In case you're still not getting it:)

&gt; ""In attempting to put together a list of the 10 best games of the last decade, the EW brain trust looked at games that pushed the medium forward. ""

^ So it's not about which game you like the most, it's about whichever ""pushed the medium forward""."

(Actually, I had just responded to the wrong comment; my bad.)"
