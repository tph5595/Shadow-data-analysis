20041,"I bought a gamecube because of my love for Zelda, and apart from Windwaker, the only other game I bought for it was the Final Fantasy game.

While I enjoyed Windwaker, I never finished it. I played it through at least 6 times up to the part where you have to start hunting for the triforce fragments.. and would always get bored, stop playing and then restart.

While it was a beautiful game, it never caught me the way others in the series has. I can think of many other games for that decade that deserve that title more, and this is coming from a 30 year old woman with a Triforce tattoo. Windwaker never really did it for me."
