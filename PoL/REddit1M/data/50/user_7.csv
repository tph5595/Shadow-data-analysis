14493,"""Thereâ€™s no mention of hit games like Call of Duty (any of them), Battlefield 3, Skyrim, Halo (any of them), Uncharted and countless other games.""  
  
Good. I wouldn't argue if Halo was on the list given that it was the GoldenEye of its time, but it IS 11 years old now and outside of the ""past decade"" qualifier.
  
I can see how, mechanically and visually, WW was a leap ahead and though it's not necessarily one of MY favorites it deserves to be on the list"

Oh my fuck the controls...  
I haven't hated the controls of any game more than that game... You feel like a clumsy, drunk puppet. The true adversary of the game is Wander and just trying to get the guy to do what you intend.  
  
It's a very unique experience and I loved the fact that there was no break away from the present experience; I don't know how to interpret that in terms of ""Top 10 of the last 10 years"" though"
57418,"One of the best-looking gameCube games. At the time cel-shading was still taking off and they did an amazing job with it. If you play it on a modern TV today it scales very well. The controls were tight and added a lot, which extras like picking up and using enemy weapons with realistic tassle physics. I know it borders into ""fluff"" at that point, but they put an exceptional amount of work into the game.  
They may have included the ability to connect with the GBA, even though officially it's a stupid feature"
57495,"Not saying I don't love Skyrim myself, but one of the most important games of the past 10 years?. My ""good"" was only in that respect; they're all quality games I'm sure but I don't believe they've changed or impacted gaming as much as others."
