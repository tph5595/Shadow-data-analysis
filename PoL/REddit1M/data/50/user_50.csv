If it was a cheaper community it was one night a week, but in this chain of really upscale places I delivered to had a room with *just* a TV and Wii Sports running all day. Would see people playing it all the time. Trust me, it's a hit with a demographic that video games never even had a chance with before. In that regard, what a freakin' revolution. And not just retirees. People who have lived in the video game revolution of the 70's and 80's who never batted an eye at arcades, pac man fever, home consoles... they own Wiis. They play Wii Sports. It's amazing how well it's done for Nintendo. A killer launch title."

I mean, these games are all truly great, but HL2 properly shit all over all other FPSes at the time, and it took someone else at least five years before they weren't being directly compared to how HL2 did it right and their FPS was flawed. Plus, you know how the internet is with Valve as a company."
