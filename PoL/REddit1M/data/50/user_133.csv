93255,"While I can understand liking TP over WW because of how WW forced you to do lengthy quests instead of giving you the option of skipping them like most zelda games do, I still think that WW added a lot more new ideas to the game than TP did. While TP was a joy to look at and a fun game, it was incredibly linear and I didn't really feel they added enough new stuff. The wolf stuff was cool, but at a certain point it just stopped evolving. I thought they could have done a lot more with it and I certainly wouldn't nominate it for this award, regardless of WW. "
