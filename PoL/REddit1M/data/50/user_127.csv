77384,"Wind Waker was my first console Zelda so I'm biased. But everything that OOT fanboys hated, I loved.

I loved the crisp, silky graphics. I loved the ""cartoony"" style. It gave the game *flair*. A distinct flair no Zelda prior had, and something few mainstream games these days dare do.

I loved sailing around the map and discovering small ""useless"" islands full of treasure. All the games I had played before were 2D, so seeing land on the far horizon and knowing I could *actually* go there was a new kind of fun for me.

The only Zelda title I more thoroughly enjoyed was Majora's Mask â€”also under appreciated. But that's a rant for another post.  "
