33502,"I loved Windwaker, it was great, and really changed my ideas on what a Zelda game could be. I found it underwhelming to see them return to that formula for Twilight Princess.

But I'm not exactly sure why it's on this list. When it came out, people whined and complained it wasn't the ""edgy Link"" we had seen in a tech demo. And then when Twilight Princess finally came out, those fans who had a hard on for blood lust and guys who can't control their emotions were satiated. Then Skyward Sword comes out, and bam! Those same people are complaining.

Now, I'm not a fan of the Wii, but I am a fan of Nintendo. I got a Wii a couple days after release due to GameCrazy and a personal relationship I had formed with the staff there. I bought a Wii because of Wii sports (and ended up selling it because I was bored of it). If Wii Sports didn't exist, Motion Gaming as a whole would have flopped. And while I prefer my keyboard and mouse, I recognize there are a lot of people who love it. It's a huge market, and without the innovation of the Wii and the success of Wii sports, the gaming industry would not be nearly as diverse as it is now. 

Some of my favorite games did not make this list, but that's ok, I didn't write in my personal tastes - but I truly believe that Wii Sports deserves the number one spot, for the decade."
