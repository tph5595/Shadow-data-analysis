That's especially bad in this case if it means less attention spent by game companies on pleasing people who actually like videogames. I don't want more people adopting my interest if it means watering down the experience for me. 
Wii Sports is a joke to the hardcore gaming community. It's similar to how Avatar may have gotten some people to see a 3d movie but it's a joke to people who actually like movies."
