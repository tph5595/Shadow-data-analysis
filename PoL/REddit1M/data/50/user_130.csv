Beautiful, great voice acting, excellent character development, extremely engaging story and (most memorably) it never felt like a game. I felt like I was watching a movie.

But Wind Waker rules still."

79870,And the beautiful colors and things to see made it all the more enjoyable.
79910,I was so excited when I heard Jet Set Radio Future was available on XBOX for download. Now I just need to save up for it.

And I loved how Ganondorf turned into Ganon first, then you fought him in his human form. It took him how many games to realize that he is strong when he has two leg? lol"
80151,I have a terrible fear of things under deep water and that boss terrified me.
