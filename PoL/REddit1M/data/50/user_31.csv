19312,I didn't finish Wind Waker. The Tingle map quest really turns me off. 
20838,"I loved the rest of the game a lot! The combat was fluid, the characters were great, it didn't have the stuff that bothered me from SS, but Tingle... Every Zelda game has this one thing. One thing! That doesn't make me want to replay it! And it's always different! "
20955,"It would be perfect without Tingle. I really don't want to go around the huge map to find a map, pay Tingle to translate it, find the triforce shard with that map and then repeat it a shit load of times. "

67681,That's what makes me go back to Skyrim where I can just steal the damn thing.
