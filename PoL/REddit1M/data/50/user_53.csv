24147,"Wind Waker was good, but consider all of the other games released in that decade.  Portal 1, Mass Effects 1 and 2, Resident Evil 4, a majority of the Halo series.

I am not downplaying Wind Waker's greatness, because I love that game, I just wanted to consider the other amazing games that have come out in the same decade. "
