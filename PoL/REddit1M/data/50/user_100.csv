78714,"I wouldn't say the need to have the boat was restrictive, and ""exploring the game world"" in past Legend of Zelda games was literally nothing more than crossing a field. Hyrule Field may have been cool at the time but in retrospect it was really nothing more than a very large level. Wind Waker allowed for open exploration in a very nonlinear fashion, while providing diversions like charting, finding treasures, and other ""open world"" side quests like the figurines. I can't think of a game that was as expansive as Wind Waker that preceded it. Comparatively, Uncharted introduced literally nothing. As a shooter, it took steps *backwards*. The ""platforming"" wasn't especially inspired either, because it just followed linear paths you climbed along, unlike something like Assassin's Creed. Uncharted is a good movie, but as a game, it's really nothing impressive. "
