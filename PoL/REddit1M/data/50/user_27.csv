17565,"EVERYBODY has heard of ""Osu!"".  It's quite popular really."
23135,Honestly I fucking hate Osu because it's too damn difficult and it makes my wrist hurt after a short time of playing it haha.

29945,"It's not so much directly that game itself.  My wrist gets sore after like hours and hours of league of legends, and diablo 3 (little faster with that one).  Osu on the other hand really gets to it pretty quick.  I guess it's just because it's a lot of movement really quick."
82335,I feel like every Zelda game has that effect.  Honestly probably more so than wind waker actually.  Might be just me.
