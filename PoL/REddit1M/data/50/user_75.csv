Instead of your boat being a tool that you can use to explore the world at your leasure, it's something that you use to get from A to B and won't let you do anything really interesting untill you actually get to the island.

If sailing was an occasional process that you didn't have to do if you didn't want to explore areas you hadn't already been to, and the sea actually had things like hidden islands, then it would be awesome."
