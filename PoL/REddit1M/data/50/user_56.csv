25955,"What you need to understand is that the Wii (specifically Wii Sports) revolutionized the business of gaming.

It used to be that gaming was an activity for kids, teenagers, and adults between the ages of 20 and 30. Otherwise, it was looked down on in society.

Usually while playing, it was more normal to be playing with a few friends, alone, in a room/basement.

When the Wii came out, it did what nobody else could do; they made it gaming a family activity. Everybody wanted to play Wii Sports! Mom, dad, grandma, grandpa, even that strange cousin who taps to the strange rhythms in his head!

Now you're asking yourself, ""what was the big appeal?"" well, the reason being that with the Wii, you're actually ""doing something."" You're not sitting down pushing buttons, you're up and moving about. It caused the older generations to realize that gaming wasn't ""lazy"" as they might put it.

So yes, Wii Sports should more assuredly be up there, and honestly, I think it should win."
