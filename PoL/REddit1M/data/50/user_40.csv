Between listening to the music, moving the camera so it feels like you're in a movie, and all the things you can do on the random islands you fine, it's really exciting and I can't help but get sucked into the game whenever I do it."

But as handmethatkittensaid, it has a very hands-on feel. When sailing around on the vast world I could just sit back, enjoy the beautiful music (WW has my favorite soundtrack out of the entire series), and ""film"" Link and the vibrant surroundings as I passed them. It totally immersed me in the game and added another layer to everything for me. You aren't just sailing places, you're *sailing* places. It was exciting to see new things show up in the horizon, and with the ability to move the camera at my will I could play around with the suspenseful and magical scenery and moods that Wind Waker brought to the forefront as I sailed into who-knows-where."

It does. I mean, the entire map is littered with islands you don't need to explore to complete the game.

&gt; won't let you do anything really interesting untill you actually get to the island.

Err giant squid fights, random bad guy outposts, submarines, etc.

Anyway, no point in carrying on this conversation. We obviously have different ideas of what makes a game fun. :)"
