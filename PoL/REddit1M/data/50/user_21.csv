25549,"I asked many people at my school, and out of the tons I asked only like one has ever heard of it. "
25607,"That's not it man! I'm talking about osu!, the PC version. That is the DS game that the PC version is based off of. 

I consider the PC version superior in every way. 

[Here's a link to it](http://osu.ppy.sh/)."
25740,"[Here's a link to it](http://osu.ppy.sh/). The other guy's link was wrong, as it linked to the DS version. 

It's a free download, and songs are made by players using the level editor. So to get songs, you have to download them from the site. I consider this a good thing because it means the song library is infinite. My folder is 8.5 gb now. 

If you have a tablet, use it. Also, tap notes using 'z' and 'x', not the mouse buttons. "
25817,"The songs range in difficulty man. You can try easier ones to practise. 

Also, why does your wrist hurt? Do you play with a mouse or a pen tablet? "
26033,"Blast to play doesn't begin to describe it. I've been playing for over a year and I have not gotten bored of it one bit. It's way too fun and addicting. I'm always working on my technique (learning to alternate fingers for jumps), finger speed, rhythm, stream timing, spinning, etc. 

[Here's a link to it, in case you want to try it.](http://osu.ppy.sh/) Remember to use 'z' and 'x' to hit notes. "
26957,The mouse didn't hurt my wrist that much back when I played with it. Only when there was no break for a long time and my hand got into an uncomfortable position for a long time. That happened less when I raised my sensitivity.
40518,"Yeah that makes sense, but I'm curious as to how you're holding your mouse. Maybe there is a better way? I think your arm bent at around 90 degrees should be fine. "
68797,"Maybe you mis-read my comment. I said ""DS version that the PC version is based off of"". That is to say, the PC version is based off of the DS version. 

As for which is superior, believe me, I thought the DS version was amazing and there's no way a PC fangame could be better. However, I beat Jumping Jack Flash with an S rank (after playing it a *lot*) and had nowhere to go, but with the PC version there is absolutely no limit to difficulty. The very best player, cookiezi, can find songs too hard for him. 

Also:

* The PC version has controls which allow for something called ""streaming"", an extremely fun and crucial part of the game. Basically, it's hitting hit circles that form in a line really really fast, which you can do by alternating between clicking 'z' and clicking 'x'. The DS version did not have streaming, as a person can't tap the touch screen that fast.

* The PC version is full-fledged online, with a friend and chat system, spectating, online modes like co-op and head-to-head, etc. 

* There is a requests feature on the website, where people post requests and the most voted ones go to the top. The creator of the game reads these and updates the game constantly. It has an update probably more than once a week, and the game improves rapidly. 

* The song library is infinite, which means you can find any type of beatmap. Jumpy ones, streamy ones, etc. New songs are added all the time. The DS version only had beatmaps made by the main developers, which really limits how much creativity you can see in the maps. 

I've been playing for maybe two years, and there is a reason it's my game of the decade. I don't think the DS game comes close to the PC game if you've played both a lot. "
