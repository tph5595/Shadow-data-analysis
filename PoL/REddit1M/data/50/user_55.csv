25432,"It has a lot of great things going for it. While it *does* have a blizzard of problems, it really is a fun and memorable experience."
25548,"ME2 is terrible? EA is terrible in general. Dead Space and Mirror's Edge make my dick rock hard, but everything else just sucks."
25670,"As much as I love *Prime*, it's basically just a 3D *Super Metroid*. It was amazing, but not paradigmatic the way that *Wii Sports* was."
25764,"The game is set on a vast ocean. It has to *feel* that way, not just look that way."
25883,"As long as we're listing our top three

1. ...

Fuck it. I can't decide. They're all so good."
26039,You two sound like quitters.
26272,"Short is not a bad thing. Most games these days have far too much content simply to lengthen the experience. Playing Portal is like eating three cherries, while playing Portal 2 is like eating five cherries in a cup of flour. They're both great games, but one - like many games these days - has a lot of fluff."
71223,"No, I'm not kidding. *Prime* has the same general areas as *Super Metroid* - the old ruins, the lava level, the crashed ship, the pirate-infested hole. I'm not being a reductionist, I'm saying the games are nearly thematically-identical."
71242,That's the general idea.
71306,"Arkham City is great, but it has so many problems. Definitely blows the other two out of the water, though."
71369,"In what way? Atmospherically? Artistically? Mechanically? Like I say, they're both great experiences, but Portal 2 wastes your time with a lot of nonsense."
71437,"I haven't played much of *Zelda II*, but the Oracles are incredible games. I consider them to be part of a trilogy with *Link's Awakening*."
116734,"Most games aren't designed around vast stretches of open sea, either."
117396,"We're essentially disagreeing about the criteria for a good game. You mention ""momentum,"" but I disagree. I think a good game is one that exhibits thoughtful and consistent game design, momentous or otherwise. WW certainly fits the bill."
207405,"It only seems like the fat is trimmed when you compare Portal 2 to even fluffier games (* cough * Assassin's Creed III @ 60 hours * cough *). I was only comparing single player campaigns because I personally subscribe to the philosophy that games featuring single player should be able to stand on the single player alone, but I suppose that isn't fair to Portal 2 since the second campaign is designed around co-op. In that respect I certainly agree with you that Portal 2 has much more going for it.

Still, if we compare single player campaigns alone, Portal 1 has just enough. It has only what it needs and no more. There's no clutter and nothing extraneous. Portal 2 does expand on the story, but this is what we should expect in a sequel. Portal 2, on the other hand, wastes a lot of your time having you play ""Where's Waldo?"" with the single white panel in a huge environment. That's not a puzzle - that's a visual fetch quest. 

The test chamber segments are separated by miles and miles of tunnel networks. It's very artistic and thematic and atmospheric and what have you, but it gives the game a very stop-and-start momentum.

Like I said, they're both truly astounding titles. VALVe is really and truly pushing the medium forward. VALVe is definitely one of the best game developers right now and they're certainly one of the best at not wasting the player's time or filling their games with fluff, but Portal 2 isn't exempt. Hours-wise, it could have achieved the same thing in less time. 

If the cherry analogy didn't do it for you, I'll try another. Playing Portal is like finding $5 on the ground, but playing Portal 2 is like finding $10 that happens to be smeared with something sticky and pungent."
