60289,"i hated TP because of the stupid wolf gimmick. You used it to find the glowy orb things then after that it was just a way to run faster. They tried to force you to use it by making it so entrances were only dirt holes that you had to dig through, but they just completely wasted the potential of the mechanic.

oh yeah, that and the whole 'hey here is this boss that you think you are going to be fighting the entire game but instead hes just an easy mini boss and its ganon. lol!'

at least in wind waker the final boss was RELATED to the guy you were chasing, and the final boss wasn't ganon. Or the ganon as we know it at least. EDIT i meant skyward sword not wind waker"
