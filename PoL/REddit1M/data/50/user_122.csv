69655,"arkham city's gonna win. the wind waker is one of my all-time favorite games, especially in the zelda series, which is why i think it totally deserves to win, but the masses hate zelda"
69752,"i myself wasn't a huge fan of super mario sunshine. if a mario game were to be put up for nomination, i'd say super mario bros. wii."
69851,have you seen this subreddit? the majority of the subscribers of this subreddit have the biggest and most unnecessary boners for that abortion of a zelda game.
70780,"i agree that the wolf wasn't quite used to its full potential, and i really dislike what they did with zant. that was total horse shit. however, i think skyward sword did the exact same thing with ghirahim and demise (not to mention demise was just an all-around awful villain) "
70812,"also, if you wanna talk about awful gimmicks, what about the motion controls in skyward sword?"
70836,did you even see the ending of the wind waker?
75056,"i would have been fine with that if ghirahim wasn't independent from demise, like fi wasn't independent from link. not to mention ghirahim was one of the greatest villains in the series in my opinion (like zant was in the first half of twilight princess) and then they ruined it in the end by showing that he was nothing but a powerless servant. they did better with ghirahim than with zant, but it was still incredibly anticlimactic, especially with how lame demise turned out to be."
