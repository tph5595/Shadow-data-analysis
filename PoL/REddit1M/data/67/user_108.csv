47679,"&gt; there is a reason hardly anyone goes there for any medical procedure

What you mean to say is, ""hardly anyone I know"", which is a much different statistic. Doesn't have the same impact though, does it?

&gt; It's really clear to me you have never been there

It seems more clear that you believe everything your god emperor says about the evil drug-dealing rapist brown people. Sure, there are some really horrible people there... there are also some really horrible people here. Literally every country in the world has ""places you shouldn't go"", but that has no real bearing on the country as a whole."
70616,"&gt; Like your whole point of ""there is bad people there but also here"" is the dumbest fucking thing i ever heard.

If you're going to quote me, try doing it accurately. I would never use such abysmal grammar. In fact, your entire comment is riddled with poor grammar and personal attacks. Couple that with your post history being full of conspiracy theories, and I really worry for you. Perhaps you should see a therapist?

&gt; im sure my experience was completely unique and not common at all.

If that happened, you have my pity, but as you pointed out, your experience is anecdotal. You probably hope that I'll trust it more because you called it out that way, but I don't. Given your clear agenda, I truly doubt anything even close to that occurred.

&gt; Since you want to talk in pure statistics, please show me the statistics on how many people wod either be willing to go there for healthcare

There's a lot of information on medical tourism, but the actual numbers are anyone's guess. I've seen estimates that claim millions go to Mexico for medical treatment from California alone, but I don't particularly trust those numbers. That said, it's a big enough business that there are companies who specifically market to Americans, going so far as to [provide a shuttle](http://www.perfectsmiledental.com.mx/travel-shuttle/complementary-transportation/). I've never met a MAGA cult member who actually reads my links, so these will probably be for the benefit of others:

&gt; Like your whole point of ""there is bad people there but also here"" is the dumbest fucking thing i ever heard. By that logic, all countries would be 100 percent equal in terms of safety and standards because some bad people reside in all of them. Your logic is flawed AF.

I never claimed all countries are equal. That is a [straw man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Straw_man) that you constructed to make my argument seem wrong. You can't simultaneously create a logical fallacy and then accuse me of using flawed logic. It's childish, like an argument you'd hear on a playground.

&gt; hurr durr #nopointtobemade

Aww, how cute, more childishness.

&gt; Admit it, you've never been there. Its ok

Based on what you've said, I've definitely spent more time in both Central and South America than you have."
133408,"I gave you information, you responded with more childishness. You claim you're a woman, but you don't write like one, so I'm leaning toward Russian troll, especially because you responded in the middle of the night.

Either way, I don't really care. You clearly have no intention of having a reasonable conversation, so I have no intention of continuing it. Be gone."
