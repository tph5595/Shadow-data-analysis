14244,"I think it looks awesome! I don’t know why there are so many assholes in this sub that hate tattoos, but yours looks very nice. "
26090,"Actually it looks perfectly fine, but the real problem with your opinion is that the tattoo could be an absolute masterpiece and you’d still be talking shit. Literally every time someone posts their tattoo in this sub, assholes crawl out of the woodwork to shit on everything. I have no reason to believe that people like you would change their tune if there was anything different about this post. "
59452,I’ve seen too many posts like this get the same reaction to believe that. 
59837,"Considering that the “uneven” parts are all on the same side, I’m more inclined to believe that it’s because the tattoo is on a round surface on OP’s body. Meaning it’s mostly the perspective of the photo. "
60103,So you’re going to be a prick to someone just because you think the quality of the artwork doesn’t reach your standards? That’s called being a snob. 
62809,"It isn’t false praise, that’s just what you tell yourself when you get called out for being a piece of shit to someone. You’re not an “honest” snob, you’re an elitist snob sticking his nose up at another person. I mean, seriously, do you see how absurd you are being? Pretending that the problem is that not enough people are insulting this random guy’s tattoo? Are you twelve? Because the only problem a normal person would see is all the brats on this sub who don’t know how to handle not liking some art they saw on the internet. "
