44934,Wholeeee lot of people pretending they're not being biased against mexico in this thread.  Good lord.
45032,Really cheap by US standards.  Its like nobody in this thread has any idea of exchange rates.
45082,You don't need to mean to be offensive to be offensive.

Incredibly disappointed in this sub right now.  Like, what the fuck is wrong with you people?  Gaming subs tend to suck because gamers as a group tend to include some of the bottom of the barrel of the population (someone is going to pretend they don't know what I mean here), but, still, wow.  I'd hope better from Zelda fans but I guess there's no reason they'd be better."
45607,"I mean, yeah, it IS cheap and of course he's pointing that out.  But a 40$ tattoo in the USA and a 40$ tattoo in Mexico are not the same level of ""so cheap its a bad idea"".  Lot of people here are sort of blindly in that mindset, though."
48649,"That's what I thought it was and of course there should be riffs and jokes, but check out how everyone who responds seriously with observations about ""hey this is actually sanitary / an ok price / whatever"" is getting crazy downvoted.  Feels like there's more going on."
