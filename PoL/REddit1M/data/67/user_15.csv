13240,"The outlines on the Triforce looks like it was done in pen. Heavy to thin lining doesnt help the case either. The bottom of the sword looks like a fuckin ribbon flapping in the wind and the symmetry is beyond fucked.

Its not the worst tat in the world, but dont try and compare this to a good shop that would charge you $250. 

This is a $150 piece at a bottom tier shop and $250-300 for a great shop that would have made it pristine. So yeah, OP got a ""good deal"" assuming he doesnt come back with hep C in a few years, but you are mistaken at your price point for that work."
