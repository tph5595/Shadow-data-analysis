46398,"ITT people that have never been to mexico acting like it's just as good as any western country health-standards wise.

Seriously. You have never been to mexico. Just stop. If you had, you would know why no one flys there to get their wisdom teeth removed or other medical procedures. You can get all four wisdom teeth removed in mexico for 200 bucks. Sometimes, it works out and is a good idea (like OP's tattoo, 50 bucks and looks great), but there is a reason hardly anyone goes there for any medical procedure. 

So what's more likely - everybody is a bigot, or people realize they have lower health standards and (often) lower quality of work?

And by the way, if you get off the beaten path, which i dont unless it's by accident, it absolutely is a savage place. It's really clear to me you have never been there or if you have, you sat in a resort the whole time. Ignorant people calling people ignorant."
46823,"Haha true. Le reddit at its finest.

Been to mexcio about 15 times in my life but downvoted by people who have never left their town because reeeee"

48744,"My god emporer? I had been to mexico years before I ever learned who trump was and it was pretty obvious even as a kid that it is not a safe country and much less safe than america or canada. How dumb are you? I never said anything about drugs or rape either, even though my own mother did almost get raped inside a store while i was with her, and i had to scream at the mexican guy to unlock the door, where she was standing in a store with 5 other mexican men. Im sure they had good intentions right? That's why the door was locked in a store that was open? But hey that's just anecdotal right...im sure my experience was completely unique and not common at all.

Since you want to talk in pure statistics, please show me the statistics on how many people wod either be willing to go there for healthcare, or do go there for healthcare from the USA or Canada. Please educate me so I don't have to use my ""much different statistics""

Like your whole point of ""there is bad people there but also here"" is the dumbest fucking thing i ever heard. By that logic, all countries would be 100 percent equal in terms of safety and standards because some bad people reside in all of them. Your logic is flawed AF. ""Yeah syria is just as safe as any other country. Sure there bad people there but there are bad people here, too. God emporer trump hurr durr #nopointtobemade""

ðŸ˜‚

Oh and one little edit - the ""places you shouldn't go"" in mexico is pretty much anywhere that isn't for tourists. So yeah, when the majority of the country is a 'bad area' it kinda does have a bearing on the country as a whole. Admit it, you've never been there. Its ok"
54790,Wow great rebuttal. Lmfao.
68083,"Oh thank you for noticing.

Now does anyone have an actual counter-argument to make or...?"
111666,"Lmao you go through my post history because your argument is just so weak. Attacking my grammar? So desperate. Yeah man, I have such an ""agenda"". Why do you suppose mexicans are attempting to enter the usa to live permanently but not the other way around? It is a dangerous country, and we aren't talking about central or south america anyway so what in the fuck are you even talking about? Do you realize mexico is in fact in north america or are you equally as ignorant of the countries location as you are of the place itself? We are talking about a SPECIFIC COUNTRY in North America, and you start rambling on about how you've been to other continents besides the one we are even talking about. Then you call strawman after doing that...were you sober when you wrote this post?

 I don't hate mexicans or mexico. You are just a fool who refuses to acknowledge that it is a dangerous place with crooked police, people offering you drugs openly with kids around, insane crime statistics and many other atrocious facts. You literally did say ""bad people are everywhere"" as a support to your argument so whether or not I quoted you with correct grammar(lmao so irrelevant) doesn't change the fact that you attempted to make such an assinine point. Again, you have never been to mexico and its obvious.

And by the way, I have plenty of other stories to go with that one. That was just the most serious. So either im the unluckiest girl in the world and just keep bumping into the bad-egg mexicans, or the country is fucking dangerous. Not hard to figure that one out even for you I don't think?

I didn't realize supporting a presidential campaign and now sitting president makes me a member of a cult. Wow. TIL. I guess if you're a fan of a band or a celebrity you're in a cult also. Top kek at your logic."
138047,"I dont write like a woman...and I was up late at 3 am on my phone so therefore I am a russian troll. Lmfaoooo

Holy shit you have reached entirely new levels of ignorance and stupidity. No wonder you think mexico is just as safe as anywhere else and deflect on visiting other continents when called out for never having been there.

Here, I'll write like a woman for you you sexist moron

U R DUMB ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚
