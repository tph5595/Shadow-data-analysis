40720,I dunno man. I’d say it’s pretty common knowledge that if you pay $40 for permanent body art  regardless of where it was done that is considered high risk. 
125718,"I don’t really know what else to say. I have no tattoos. I have friends who do have them and they look great. They also paid upwards of $3000 to get their entire sleeve /arm to shoulder done. 
I don’t know what I would even get as *PERMANENT* body ink, but I know for damn sure I wouldn’t get it done in Mexico for $40. It’s nothing against Mexico, it’s everything against cheap tattoos being a bad investment. "
126063,"Okay, it’s not hatred or bigotry. Just chill out for a sec. $40 is too cheap for a tattoo. End of story. I don’t give a fuck where it was done, Mexico, The States, Canada, etc etc. $40 for something permanent on your body just isn’t enough to make the decision worthwhile. You understand that out of that $40 has to come someone’s hourly wage, right? Now say the artist takes 1 hour to do your piece. You’re now paying $20 for his hour of labor, and $20 for the actual tattoo.  Here’s the most IMPORTANT part that everyone calling out bigotry is missing -  *I’M NOT GOING TO SPEND A LOW AMOUNT OF MONEY ON SOMETHING ILL HAVE ON THE SHELL OF MY SOUL FOR THE REST OF MY FUCKIN LIFE.* I don’t care what country it’s from, $40 is too damn little for quality tattoos. "
