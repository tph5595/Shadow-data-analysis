25321,Actually it looks like garbage which is all anyone should expect when paying $40 for tattoo. Why go for a bargain when getting something that stays on you for life? 
53887,Is it that people can’t tell the difference between a good tattoo and a shit tattoo or that they just feel the need to lie and say it looks nice? 
54526,"It’s not an opinion it’s a fact, that tattoo is poorly done. If it was a masterpiece I’d be happy say it was cool since it’s both Zelda and a tattoo which are both things I like. I have many tattoos and I am involved in the industry I’m not hating it for being a tattoo I’m just being honest that it’s not quality artwork. "
