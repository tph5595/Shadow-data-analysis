73780,"""but saying Mexico is  a clean hygienic place probably only applies to specific areas and not everywhere is safe just like the US"" Please don't. So, you're saying EVERY TATTOO SHOP on the US is clean and safe? Yeah, I don't think so. It's the same way here. It's only gonna be dangerous if you go to a _really bad_ ""neighborhood "" as it happens all around the world. I appreciate you weren't rude tho. But to me, most comments here don't make any sense.
