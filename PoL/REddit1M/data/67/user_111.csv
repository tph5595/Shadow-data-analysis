48749,That's because it's a tattoo... They swell.
48954,He was making a joke. It just looks horrible.
49060,No. It's a very poorly done tattoo.  If you're going to submit something like this to reddit you've got to be ready for feedback.  I've worked in the industry for almost 15 years and this is just not good work.
49191,You spelled 'asinine' wrong.
50282,"I've worked in the industry for 15 years. There is no ""whoosh"". It is a horrible tattoo regardless of how much they paid for it.  I don't care if it was free,a bad tattoo is a bad tattoo."
52551,Being satisfied with it doesn't make it good. And I didn't say anything about the price or where it was done. This tattoo could have been done for free in a garage or cost $400 at Pure in NYC and if it came out looking like this it would still be just a bad tattoo.
71094,"I actually showed the apprentice at my shop this tattoo and am having him pick out all the mistakes.  Poor kid just looked at me and said ""*all of them?*"""
71182,You know nothing about tattoos if you think that is well done.
71257,...or they have worked in the tattoo industry for 15 years and can spot a terrible tattoo when they see one.
