27002,And people making negative generalizations  about Mexico when they have no idea where in Mexico he got it or in what context
27054,Yeah the bigots are coming out of the woodwork when they have no idea about where he got the tattoo
27142,"Lotta bigotry IIT, it’s disappointing. You have no idea about the context of where he got that tattoo; it could be way less sketchy than your average parlor in a big American city.

The price may be more of a function of the USD going far in Mexico 

Edit: honestly ashamed of this sub rn. People generalizing “Mexico is a dirty country, why would you get that tattoo?” When they have no clue where in Mexico he got it or in what context. There are sketchy and quality tattoo parlors in every country. The cheap price is more a function of the exchange rate. 

Then downvoting me into oblivion for calling out the hatred "
62839,"What a massive generalization you’re making.

Yeah, Mexico is generally less sanitary than the US, but there are good and bad parts, just like any country"
63584,"You’re missing the point.

People are basically saying “Mexico is a dirty country, you’re taking a huge risk getting that tattoo” when they have no idea where in Mexico he got it"
149846,"a) Yes, they are saying that in certain parts of the thread

b) the dollar goes so far in Mexico that that may be the equivalent of a $100 tattoo in the US"
149963,"yes, it is, in some cases here. 

People are saying things like ""you really trust the sanitation in Mexico""? and ""sounds like a good way to get Hep C!""

and b) the exchange rate in Mexico is such that that could be the equivalent of a $100 tattoo in the US"
