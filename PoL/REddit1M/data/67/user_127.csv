59509,"I mean, no disrespect, I remember hearing plenty of times as a younger kid that getting tattoos from places that had shady licenses could get you a blood borne illness. So Mexico was one of those places.

I'm not saying that's absolutely true and Mexico is a dirty disease spreading place, but that was absolutely taught in school."

That was literally taught during health class for things like HIV, and HEPC teachings on how people get it.

I don't have all the stats or data on HIV or bloodborne illnesses but saying Mexico is  a clean hygienic place probably only applies to specific areas and not everywhere is safe just like the US. 

Do you know have the data on this?"

I wrote just like the US there are probably areas where it's safe and where it's not."
