26128,"What exactly is the split of the downfall timeline?  I'd always assumed something went wrong when Link tried to pull out the master sword and he just never came back after what he did as a child leading up to opening the temple of time.  Is there a specific part in the adult timeline where he failed that separates the downfall timeline, or is it just generally assumed he could have failed at any point?

Because going by what I thought the split was (adult Link never showing up), the Zora monuments confirm BotW to be in the adult timeline."

That plus the existence of the Koroks and Rito point towards the Wind Waker timeline.  Additionally, someone pointed out that there is evidence the world was flooded.  First, you have the leviathan skeletons which could have been whales. Additionally the item description of rock salt mentions the ancient sea, plus you have the fact that it can be found very high up and very far away from any water sources."
