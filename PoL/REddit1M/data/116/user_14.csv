11491,"In the Downfall timeline the Kokiri are implied to turn into lumberjacks. The lumberjacks in ALTTP are dressed in green tunics with pointy hats in spite of not being Link, though that isn't definitive proof since that's true for many non-player characters. What *is* better proof, though, is that Kokiri is an anagram of Kokori, the Japanese word for lumberjack.

EDIT: Kikori, not Kokori."
14452,You're right. It's Kikori.
