0,"According to the ingame description
&gt;It's been called many names, from ""Great King of Evil"" to ""Calamity."" Hibernating within a cocoon, it attempted to regenerate a physical form after Link awoke but was forced to confront him in an incomplete state

I just noticed something interesting about Ganon

For one, he is the Ganon from Oot, not a reincarnation. He is literally called ""Great King of Evil"" meaning that this game is on the Adult timeline OR the Downfall timeline, as he didn't have that title on the Child Timeline.

Second, when capturing the castle and becoming a cocoon, Ganon attempts to revert back to his Gerudo form. Zelda, by getting captured, managed to keep him from becoming Ganondorf again. His whole attempt to infect the Guardians and the Divine Beast was both to safeguard himself from getting sealed and to buy some time to become human again. On his human form, he is a little more dangerous than his beast/ethereal form. He is shown to be more cunning, less brutal but holds equal to more control on his power, which makes him a more big of a threat

On his battle, you manage to see him basically trying to become physical again but only managed to get Guardian elements to become physical. Hence the words from Zelda

&gt;Given up his reincarnation

This doesn't mean he is not going to appear again. He gave up trying to become Ganondorf and went full beast form, trying to take down Link.

TL;DR Ganon is the same as the one from Oot and is trying to revert back to Ganondorf by the time he conquers the castle but it is stopped by Zelda

4118,"they do matter, as they are considered canon by Nintendo

There are few loopholes here and there but the main idea of the timelines remain"
8233,yep
9697,"he stated that the timeline will be disclosed later on but he gave a hint

""the game falls on the timeline Link fights Ganon the most times""

Adult Timeline= 1 time

Child Timeline= 2 times

Downfall= 4 times(5 if we count the Link's Adventure)"
9979,"&gt; Link's hero ceremony refere to TP Link instead of WW Link

only the English version does this. This is a localization easter egg

No other language features this on the game at all"
10262,"but Ganon is mentioned

I'm not counting him in but reminding that we technically are fighting Ganon's forces from reviving him"
18108,"&gt;The triforce can only be used by mortals supposedly. 

Ganon doesn't have the Triforce on this game, that's Zelda

&gt; Hmm, but the game does reference the Hero of Twilight. So either Ganon reearned that name in the Child timeline, or the Zeldas are aware of the other timelines.

for what I'm aware, the mentions of other timelines are Easter Eggs, as different languages of the game feature all, some or none at all

19929,"while I love the detail, the Jewel on his forehead is not like the one on OoT or TP

if you look closely, it is the top of a guardian sentry's upper half"
20166,"actually it isn't

Ruto is also a Sage on the Downfall timeline"
20701,"Hylians have a lifespan similar to humans and Sheikans, so about ~100 years

The last time that Ganon was sealed is 10k years prior to the BOTW"
20873,"we only see Ganon die and comeback as a completely different person

On FSA, which is after TP, Ganondorf is reincarnated and actually follows the same steps except he doesn't have the triforce"
22754,"The Ganon on FSA is a completely new being, so he starts from scratch"
26564,"The Downfall timeline starts when Link faced and lost against Ganon(on his beast form) during the events of Ocarina Of Time

After that, Ganon raided the Sacred Realm to claim the Triforce but the Sages, instead, used the entire Realm to seal him inside and avoiding him from ever returning to Hyrule

This sets in motion the events of A Link to the Past"
