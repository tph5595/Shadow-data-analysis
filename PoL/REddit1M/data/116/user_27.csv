19887,"It's not necessarily 10,100 years. In Japanese and other EA languages 10,000 is used to refer to an arbitrary very large number. It's rarely if ever meant to be specific in contexts like this and is comparable to saying in English ""a bajillion years ago"" or ""a long, long time ago."""
29644,"That's not a good assumption. It's equally likely they would have left it the way it is--there are much more blatant acts of missing the non-literal meanings in Japanese scripts in gaming history, and something like that gets the point across when translated literally anyways. 

And it wouldn't be a retcon. It's the original intent. Literally 99.999% of the time you see ""10,000 years"" in something of Japanese origin, it's just an arbitrary, very long length of time. I have zero doubt whatsoever that they didn't mean 10,000 years literally. Why would the Japanese scriptwriters choose one of the only numbers that will be misinterpreted by the entire Japanese audience? They would have chosen a different number if they meant it literally. It makes way more sense that translators left the number untouched than a Japanese writer didn't know enough about their own language and culture to know how the Japanese audience would interpret their work.

97860,"How many Japanese people? All of them. That's all that matters. The point is that that is what's in the Japanese script, and that's more significant than any of the translations. It makes *far* more sense that the English translator just left it that way rather than saying ""a long time ago"" than it does that the Japanese scriptwriter doesn't understand his own language and how other Japanese people will interpret it. You're assuming that the translations are 100% perfect and always perfectly keep every grain of nuance in the original script. This is not the case now, nor has it ever been, for any game. "
