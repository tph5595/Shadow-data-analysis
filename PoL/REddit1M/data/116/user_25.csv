18516,"He was trying to regain a physical body.  
whether that body was gonna be Gerudo/Humanlike is very questionable.  

"
18722,"&gt; I feel like it's a soft reboot of the timeline because it was so convoluted before. But even then, I could easily be proven wrong by Nintendo in the future.

There really wasn't anything convulted about it tho...  
It just splits in two at two points where each timeline continues on with different events having happened during OoT.  

Many series, even some with really just a single timeline of events, have WAY more convoluted stories than Zelda's timeline has.   

Like, Metal Gear and Kingdom Hearts are way more convoluted than Zelda is."
29207,"His ""mane"" in his Dark Beast Ganon form in TP is red too, and that form isn't human-like or anything.  
His beast forms still tend to have red hair, when they have any.  "
30046,"&gt; I don't think that, by regaining a meat suit, he would go back to a beast form and make it default.  

In Downfall his ""default"" has been ""Ganon"" for a long time now.  "
35481,"Except there is nothing ""gerudo-like"" to his form at all.  
all he has from his original form is that his skull structure looks human (as the red hair is shared by both beast form and human form whenever there is actual hair involved).  

He was incorporating all of the different phantoms their weaponry into the form he was creating and looked like some sort of spider/scorpion thing while half-complete.    
His form before he started with was that of the purple smoke monster we see from the plateau tower at the start.  

How exactly was he turning into ""human"" form exactly ?  
At most you could reason he was trying to have a human-like head ontop of some massive multi-weapon body.  
"
67492,"So you are just gonna ignore the fact he has like ~6 legs and 3 arms comming off his back with weaponry installed into it.  

at MOST you could argue he was trying to have a human head on top of his new monsterous body, but there is NOTHING human about his actual body."
