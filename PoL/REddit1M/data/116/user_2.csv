So similarly, we can't take any titles or references as proof this game exists in any given timeline.

I feel like it's a soft reboot of the timeline because it was so convoluted before. But even then, I could easily be proven wrong by Nintendo in the future."

Retconning and claiming 10k years was a generalization would feel cheap. But then I feel the whole three-pronged timeline was stupid, so I'm probably in the minority on this matter."
97114,"&gt; Literally 99.999% of the time you see ""10,000 years"" in something of Japanese origin, it's just an arbitrary, very long length of time.

But how many people know that, though? I sure didn't before you mentioned it."
