4407,"As much as i have always loved the deep lore to Zelda games, and especially the timeline, i have no problem admitting that this game shits all over the timeline and that it doesn't look like Aonuma even remotely cared about it when he made this game."
9440,"Well, the rock salt is said to come from the great sea, but the only way that would be possible is if the game took place long after Spirit Tracks when the sea has pulled back. If that was the case it would also be idiotic of Aonuma to have Link's hero ceremony refere to TP Link instead of WW Link. The downfall timeline is more or less ignored completely, it more or less has been ever since Aonuma took control of the series back in Ocarina.

BotW referes to both the child timeline and the adult timeline as if both happaned. There is no way in hell that would happen if they actually gave a shit about it when they made the game. I don't know if the lore of the older games fit so well together by accident or not, but this one certainly does not care for the timeline split."
10918,"Really, cause i have heard that the german version even referes to not only TP, but even alttp. If this were the case i might be back on the boat seeing this as a post Spirit Tracks game, but i haven't seen anything in the game as concrete as the legend in Wind Waker, and the execution and hero's shade in TP to connect it to the other games. Whenever it is talks about placing BotW it feels like i have to do some mental gymnastics and accept a whole lot of things that could have happaned to allow it to take place a certain place in the timeline.

If the TP reference is a localization thing then Adult timeline would make the most sense due to the OoT info we know fits best with the game we played (which is of course what leads to the adult timeline), and the rock salt thing. However, it leaves a lot to be questioned regarding what happaned to either old or new Hyrule. For all i know Aonuma has a plan and the DLC we're getting in the holiday has some answers, or maybe i was right when i said it feels like he doesn't give a shit about the timeline."
12103,"Oh god, personally i really hope they stay the heck away from timeline merging. I have never been a fan of that."
24012,"&gt;that sea is literally referred as The Ancient Sea in-game.

This is what i get for taking the word of a random redditor and not doing my own research.

&gt;The last two mainline Zelda titles before BotW that weren't remakes are set in the Downfall Timeline. That's a weird way to ignore the timeline.

They completely skipped my mind, they weren't pressent on the official timeline, so i just completely forgot. Point retracted.

I need to read up more on the details regarding every reference BotW makes to previous games."
