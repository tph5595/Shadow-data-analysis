30286,"IS THIS CANON?!

##THIS NEEDS TO BE CANON##"
30469,"i've been wanting to have an adventure in the sacred realm since i played oot. i imagine playing in the land of the triforce would be an other-worldly and mysterious landscape totally unlike any we've played in, including the twilight realm (which was, frankly, just dark and gloomy)"
30733,"maybe the tunic of the wild is the final shrine gift because it's the ultimate clue instead of a flashy piece of equipment. i hadn't considered this before, but it makes sense. tbh, i hate the downfall timeline bc it has the cheesey cartoons in it, but this story being established in that timeline would give it points in my book"
31483,"i am of the mind that they should never have created timelines. some people were asking for it, but it simply wasn't necessary and has convoluted the story a great deal. not to mention the cartoons, which are objectively awful. if they had left those out of the mix, i'd give it all a pass i guess.

a big flaw i see in the timelines is this: everything is canon now, even the garbage. the cartoons*, the ugly chicken lords from twilight princess, the outdated art from past games (particularly the comical, unintimidating look of the blue üê∑, known as ganon), etc. it's all along for the ride now, and i'd prefer to let plenty of those things go.
 
i know i'm being picky. don't get me wrong, the timeline *is* interesting and has installed a new bit of fanboyism in myself and others, but it has its drawbacks. in any case, i'm excited to see where botw falls into play. 

edit: i was told by a chungus that the cartoons were canon. they are not*"
31868,"i haven't played spirit tracks, so i can't speak on this in total confidence, but what i'm reading does not indicate any correlation between the dark world and the sacred realm. 

the dark world* appears to be a housing of demonic forces where the sacred realm is the resting place of the triforce. i could be wrong, but if you could establish your claim with a link, i'm completely open to the read! 

edit: a word*"
31933,did you upload those drawings by chance?? would love to see :)
33211,"shoot, shows how much i know! thanks for sharing. maybe it's time to go there in 3D? :D"
