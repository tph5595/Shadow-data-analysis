17695,"&gt;Ganon is the same as the one from Oot and is trying to revert back to Ganondorf by the time he conquers the castle but it is stopped by Zelda

The triforce can only be used by mortals supposedly. 

&gt;as he didn't have that title on the Child Timeline.

Hmm, but the game does reference the Hero of Twilight. So either Ganon reearned that name in the Child timeline, or the Zeldas are aware of the other timelines."
17779,There's been hints in a few other games that Ganondorf reincarnates now and then.
18032,"To be fair, in the child timeline it's also implied that the sages awoke and sealed away Ganondorf after he was arrested for his crimes, though he killed the sage of water before they managed it."
18312,"&gt;Ganon doesn't have the Triforce on this game, that's Zelda

Might explain why he was trying to revert to human is what I'm saying.

&gt;for what I'm aware, the mentions of other timelines are Easter Eggs, as different languages of the game feature all, some or none at all

Fair enough."
18945,We don't necessarily know that. The sages all look the same and look like old men - but they also look like they could be representations of the story.
20647,As would be the case in the child timeline.
22030,"Hmm, I need to up my TP lore. I forgot that supposedly the Mirror of Twilight was made by the three Goddesses. It's also thought that the big mirror in the Spirit Temple in OOT may have been an early form of the Mirror of Twilight.

That said, what I read [here](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Mirror_of_Twilight) at least doesn't seem to indicate that the sages that banished Ganondorf were something separate that only guarded the Mirror of Twilight. Ganondorf's execution seems to have happened at some point in the timeframe of OOT during the child Link timeline. "
22202,"That is a tautology.

The hero was not present at the banishing of Ganondorf in Twilight Princess, which is part of the child Link timeline."
22662,"Which monument? Something in breath of the wild?

Breath of the Wild literally refers to the Hero of Twilight several times. Ruto doesn't stop being a person in the Child timeline, and probably did help Link and Zelda defeat Ganondorf. He did poison her pet guardian fish after all. Darunia also probably had valid reasons to help them against Ganondorf."
22887,"Hmm, I'll keep looking then.

If true, then yeah, the sages weren't the awakened OOT sages. Although as I said in a different post, that doesn't necessarily mean that Ruto and Darunia had no involvement in stopping Ganondorf in the child time line, they just may not have been sages."
23063,"&gt; No Ruto does not stop being a person, but she stops being a sage in child. Which is what the monument says she is, a sage

Ah. Okay then, unless the sages had some reason to awaken in the child timeline, that probably is conclusive."
