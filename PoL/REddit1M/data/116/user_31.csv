25627,"Right. This confirms oot link is clearly better than botw link if true. As we see, botw link is hit by a guardian, and put into the shrine of ressurection. So he never got to ganon. What if young link beat ganon, he escaped from the seal after being sealed away, he hadn't recovered, there were unused guardians as young link beat ganon before they were made, and they were kept for ganon's return, while link was in termina, ganon invaded hyrule castle, corrupting the guardians, he wins, but when botw link returns to fight ganon again, ganon still hasn't recovered (again, link never got into the castle, a guardian shot him before his ressurection, he wasn't shown fighting ganon.) (why is ganon's recovery taking so long? Is it because of the sacred realm?) so ganon is weaker than he was when he fought young link (well...already harmed by young link, possibly the stuff in the sacred realm and possibly harmed by the divine beasts), and when he becomes dark beast ganon? The lasers deal huge damage to link and would kill if link had too few hearts or bad armour, so it takes botw link and zelda (another reason ganon hasn't recovered. Zelda holding him back for 100 years.) to do what young link did alone. 2 adults (a knight and a magic princess) to do what a kid did (it is possible to fight ganon as young link in oot. And even if you had to be adult because you didn't use the glitch, link had been doing nothing for 7 years. How would he get stronger in that time? He'd get weaker and soon dead from starvation...unless the 7 sages kept him alive.). So how tough would beating majora be for botw link?"
25897,"Also, while yes, oot link had help from zelda, it was ""here, have a weapon use it. not zelda sealing ganon there and then. While the 7 sages did, first link beat ganon close to death so he would be unable to fight back."
26310,"    &gt; ""the game falls on the timeline Link fights Ganon the most times""


    &gt; Adult Timeline= 1 time


    &gt; Child Timeline= 2 times


    &gt; Downfall= 4 times(5 if we count the Link's Adventure)

Oh. I just read that comment. I guess young link beats ganon half to death but is killed right before he can finish the fight. Perhaps the sages are killed, link either dies or is put into a coma as to avoid him reeincarnating (but later dies or wakes up, does stuff, said stuff not being in any games yet. Perhaps he goes to termina and kills majora but with less time due to being comatose...perhaps the moon falls...he arrives...majora dies. Idk.) and ganon fails to heal fully, the rest of the comment is still possible. (Or there are 4-5 extra links and ganons in the child timeline that don't have games yet...or perhaps ganon's being killed by non-link people...)

2 refrences. It could just be a refrence for some people who played tp. There's a painting of mario in oot, but is mario canon?"
26830,"    &gt; That is a misquoting of what he orginally said. He talked about the legend Impa tells (Switch trailer lines about the history of Calamity ganon) in BotW speaking about multiple attacks of Ganon, and that was some food for thought. Neither did he say the most nor the amount of times Link fought him

I guess it could still be adult. It probably isn't the child timeline because the warp to ganon glitch probably isn't canon.
