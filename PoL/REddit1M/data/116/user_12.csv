10093,"I've noticed a lot of the references in this version of Hyrule seem to come from OoT's Hyrule.  

The other thing I found interesting was during one of the cut scenes where Zelda is talking about how her ""Grandmother heard the voice in the sword.."" so we know this Zelda is one generation removed from whichever was the last Zelda who fought Ganon"
43634,"Zelda couldn't hear the voice from the sword until she ""awoke.""  The thirteenth memory is when she awakes and uses the power of the triforce against the Ganon possessed Guardians.  During the cut scene of her in front of the Deku tree  she finally hears the voice of the sword when she is putting it back, after Link has been taken to the Shrine of Resurrection.  It was not until this moment that she felt/used the power of the triforce, which was after Ganon had appeared(in all previous Zelda titles, the power of the triforce was only used after the appearance of Ganon).  Without the face of the enemy present, the power couldn't be drawn out, no matter how many times she preyed or secrets she tried to unlock.  The downfall was that she gained this power after Link was mortally wounded so he could not gain his power for himself.  "
