20265,"Worded it wrong. I've added ""an"" for clarity. I meant to say they're both an adult timeline"
21875,"It's also reasonable to say that they didn't. Alternatively, why would they even need to be awakened in the timeline where Ganondorf doesn't rise to power and is ""executed."" "
21987,"And since it is the case, then that would mean that child timeline isn't what the monument is referencing "
22327,What point are you trying to make? The monument says specifically that Ruto helped the hero and the princess defeat Ganon. Clearly this rules out child timeline
22977,"Yes. The Zora monuments in BotW.

It only references TP once, in memory 1. Which has been relatively agreed to be a localization Easter egg since many different languages reference multiple different games. No Ruto does not stop being a person, but she stops being a sage in child. Which is what the monument says she is, a sage. And finally, whether or not she would help them in child timeline is irrelevant as Ganondorf is outed as a traitor and the adults handle him, not Link, Zelda, or Ruto. "
