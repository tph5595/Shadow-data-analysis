31839,"It's in the child timeline, here's why: in memory number 1, Zelda clearly references the hero of Twilight. If this was in ANY OTHER timeline, the hero of Twilight would not exist. Ever. At all. Aonuma said once we played through the game it would be evident which timeline the game falls in. Go back and watch the memory if you don't believe me. I know korok are present which is WW, but it could presumed to be their natural evolution, not specific to a timeline at this point. "
