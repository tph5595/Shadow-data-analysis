10803,That's... unlikely considering that the last time they had Ganon troubles was apparently thousands of years ago.
10844,"I really want it to be the downfall timeline.  It has a bit of that classic Zelda feel to the world design, and I really want the original timeline to get a little more love.

I actually get a strong Zelda 2 feeling from this game.  The sense of exploration and ""random"" encounters has a similar feel."
15637,"Wait, what did the Zora monuments say about being in an Adult timeline?  I missed that."
21248,"Hmm...

I think it's reasonable to say that some of the sages may have discovered that they were sages in the child timeline.  They may have even discovered it more easily without curses on the temples."
21302,"Ohhh, okay, so if it specifically mentions that she helped the hero, that sure sounds like the Adult or Downfall timeline."
22514,"That assumes that the only purpose of the sages is to fight some great evil, and that they don't have some sort of general religious significance to the daily lives and rituals of the people of Hyrule.

I would assume that, without their temples being cursed, at least one or two of the sages would naturally discover, or be led into, their sagehood because the sages act as priests or prophets for their people."
34917,Heh.  Do people consider the cartoon show to actually be part of the timeline?
