22954,"&gt;Well, the rock salt is said to come from the great sea, but the only way that would be possible is if the game took place long after Spirit Tracks when the sea has pulled back.

No.  What it says is that the rock salt comes from an ""ancient sea"".  The Great Sea isn't the only sea in Hyrule's history, there's the Lanayru Sand Sea which formerly was a sea in the far past of Skyward Sword.  In fact, that sea is literally referred as The Ancient Sea in-game.

&gt;The downfall timeline is more or less ignored completely, it more or less has been ever since Aonuma took control of the series back in Ocarina.

The last two mainline Zelda titles before BotW that weren't remakes are set in the Downfall Timeline.  That's a weird way to ignore the timeline.

&gt;BotW referes to both the child timeline and the adult timeline as if both happaned. 

I fail to see how BotW refers to the child timeline at all, outside of Easter eggs of no consequence.  The only thing that could somehow be anything more than that is Zelda's speech, and it's so vague that it doesn't prove anything.

With your logic, Mario is friends with the Hyrule Royal family, since there are some pictures hanging on the walls of Hyrule Castle in OoT."
