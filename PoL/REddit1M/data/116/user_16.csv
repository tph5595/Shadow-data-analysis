14277,"Agreed, I always got the impression that it is always the same Ganon. The interesting relationship between the main three is how they persist through the ages in completely different ways. Hylia's power is passed through bloodlines, Link's spirit is reincarnated, and Ganon remains immortal and returns. "

I think we've definitely seen him change as a result of past games. In WW he is much more serious and knows ahead of time to stop the princess and master sword, and in BotW he returned after 10,000 years with memories of the guardians and a plan to control them. We know that, at least, he can last through many ages and retain memories."
