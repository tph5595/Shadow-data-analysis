47553,"Ganon(dorf) is the same one from all games. Confusingly, he is the only immortal character. (Confusing, since he literally dies in several games to then be resurrected)  
Zelda from each game is related to each other Zelda. IE: ""THE royal family of Hyrule"" being there can only be one line of Princesses.  
Link, on the other hand, is just some random kid born with blonde hair which grants him the ability to save Hyrule. Thus, each Link is a different Link and possibly has no genetic relation with any previous Link.

Now to clarify, the title does go with your theory and helps with your theory. I am just pointing out that it is the same guy that is in all the other games."
