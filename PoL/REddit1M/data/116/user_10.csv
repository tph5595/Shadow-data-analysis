9482,"Yes, I've noticed this since someone posted somewhere that the text regarding ""reincarnation"" in other languages was a bit different, much more related to this theory you suggested."
9518,"I wish the dlc was in a spirit realm, with zelda fighting his human form to prevent it from happening.
I even drew some sketches of how I imagine he would look like, based on plot, calamity's design and other stuff."
9615,"It's probably Downfall. Kokiris could've been changed into Koroks for a different slight reason this time, though."
9646,"They still do.
Don't know for how long, but Breath of the Wild definetely cares for it still."
15059,"well, what triggered their change was deku tree magic. Same can happen in two different timelines for different reasons.

I personally think that, like in WW, Ganon's appearance thousands of years before BOTW estimulated the changes from zora to rito and kokiri/whatever to korok in DT too.

The game states that the zoras came back to this Zora Domain 10k years before, somehow close to the first guardians x calamity ganon fight
"
15185,"the geography and theme, while not perfect (never is!), resemble NES Zelda a bit more.
The tunic of the wild and being an Adult timeline (as stated by zora monuments) also point to this.
"
15733,"yes, he's becoming ganondorf again, not demise or anything.
The red beard and red hair are there!"
15880,"there's also the ancient sea from pre-SS era.

Also, the Zora Monuments help define the timeline placement and CT is the only one that is completely ruled out."
16091,"They mention that long before the zoras came to the actual zora domain, there was a kind zora princess named Ruto that helped a legendary hero face the king of evil.

They also named the divine beast from her (Ruta-&gt;Ruto).
Naboris and Rudania also seem to be based off Nabooru and Darunia."
18843,the sage of water wasn't Ruto helping the hero defeat ganon.
18854,I forgot that.
20423,The hero was not present. That much is certain.
21439,"indeed.
After that it's all figuring out which timeline and games it's more similar like.

Personally, despite the koroks and rito, I see this game having a lot more in common with Downfall (NES Zelda and stuff).

Also, in this game's background story, some Zoras left Hyrule. They probably were the ones who didn't convert into Rito.

I personally believe that the great calamity forced the Ritos and Koroks into existence in this timeline as well.
"
28281,"well, his beard and hair were both red (gerudo like)."
29857,"because they're transformations based off his default form.
I don't think that, by regaining a meat suit, he would go back to a beast form and make it default.
Plus, his skull in BOTW is clearly human."
34812,"I don't have it here with me right now, but I'll paint it tomorrow then upload.

I can describe the concept now, though:

* Think HW Ganon but with a longer beard, with texture similar to the blights/calamity's beard.
* Add a long robe, similar to WW's, but open in the chest and in the legs, giving a similar vibe to Demise's open chest + HW Ganondorf.
* The hair is long, like in HW/Blights, but tied.

* Below the clothing is a almost venom (symbionte)-like malice showing up, but not reaching the center of the chest (similar to demise).

* When powered up, malice covers his body and he gains a TP/HW-like malice armor with LttP Ganon shoulder pads. The Hair becomes wilder, like in HW and his face is covered by a skull/boar malice mask with long horn-teeth.

Tomorrow I'll put up a colored picture."
35168,"Yes, but he didn't seem to like being a pig. He went for gerudo-like form, afterall."
35205,I hope!
38985,"Body, beard and skull.

It was stated that he was trying to regain a body.

Then, we have the beard. While all forms have it, it is a gerudo trait. It was back in OoT and still is in BOTW. Gerudos have red hair. The beast forms had it because they were based on his original form. Take a look at OOT Ganon. He has gerudo-like clothing and has what resembles a torn cape near his shoulders. TP Dark Beast retained the breast wound and even Ganon's forehead jewelry! His Beast forms are based on his original form.

The skull is clearly human. It even has the wide mouth he has on his gerudo form. His head plate is, unlike the blights', something that resembles Gerudo Ganon's jewelry as well. The amber stone in the middle of the forehead over a crown-like black plate that resembles TP Ganon's silhouette.

Finally, the body. It was not of a beast. It is humanoid. He had a torso and two regular arms. While one was big, the other one was still poorly developed, but it was stated that he was incomplete. One could argue that Pig Ganon is humanoid too, but, after seeing the beard, skull and jewelry, Pig Ganon is certainly not the case here."
78427,"But the jewelry, skull and beard imply more a humanoid form than pig/beast form."
78467,check the rest of discussion. Child timeline is the only one that doesn't fit.

93711,"thanks, but I honestly feel they need a lot of refinement even as sketches."
96321,"I mean Ganondorf's design. I think I can do better with him.
Maybe the robe's paintings, the boot or even his forehead jewelry."
