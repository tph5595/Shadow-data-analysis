8224,Really great inference. Maybe hinting at the potential plot of the story DLC?
8357,"They don't care about it in the sense that it isn't their main priority. There are definitely indications, as OP mentioned above, that hint at where this game fits in the timeline. Aonuma has stated that it does in fact take place after Ocarina of Time. Because of the story being less broad than any of the others, we're having to deduce it ourselves through diary readings and compendium notes."
11383,"I can see where you're coming from because it really is all over the place. The only things that remain consistent from what I can tell is that the game takes place 10,100 years after The Great Calamity (which I'm still not completely sure what that is so any explanation would be helpful) so BotW's place in the timeline is far, far ahead of any of the latest games in the timeline. What lies in between there? Maybe some convoluted event tying the timelines together lol "
28457,But wasn't he trying to come back as Ganondorf in this game?
