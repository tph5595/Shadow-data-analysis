4418,"Yeah, basically the truth is the developers don't care about making the games' narratives fit into a self-consistent ""true"" historical continuum. (And we're better off for it)

The ""official"" timeline, particularly the specifics and branching, really only exists in an amorphous fashion at best. Even the Wind Waker direct sequels don't rely on the history beyond the broader strokes.

I'm sure they'll put out a new art book sometime that says ""BoTW existed here in timeline Q"".
That's fun, placates fans and sells those books."
