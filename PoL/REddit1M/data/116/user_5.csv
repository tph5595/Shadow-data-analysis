9980,"alright, it's nothing too special, but I just wanted to point out that [Skyward Sword's ending tell us that Ganon is actually a manifestation of Demise's hate after he dies; and it can take basically any form it wants... and seeing how the game is kinda ambiguous about its timeline placement, and taking some hints from the bosses appearance, and the fact that it was just an ancient evil that suddenly sprouted without any physical form... I think this Ganon is a new manifestation of Demise's hate.] (/spoiler)"
91927,"honestly, the more we try to explore the timeline placement, more convinced I am in some sort of ""merged"" o ""remixed"" timeline...

My head hurts, too much evidence for and against, LOL. "
