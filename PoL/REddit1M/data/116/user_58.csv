114874,"&gt;    Given up his reincarnation    
This doesn't mean he is not going to appear again. He gave up trying to become Ganondorf and went full beast form, trying to take down Link.

this is what I've been saying as well about that sentence ever since the first guys started asking ""no more ganon?"" its not ""no ganon anymore"" its ""this ganon stops/gives up his physical reincarnation and tries to crush link instead""

&gt;For one, he is the Ganon from Oot, not a reincarnation. He is literally called ""Great King of Evil"" meaning that this game is on the Adult timeline OR the Downfall timeline, as he didn't have that title on the Child Timeline.

and this part, I cant agree with that. Calling him some names are really not clear indicators for a timeline placement. There are other instances in other games and in BotW itself that make conflicting statements. The stuff about the sword in Memory #1 even conflict with each other and are simple localization eastereggs and/or mistakes."
114970,completely wrong interpretation of [this](http://nintendoeverything.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-devs-on-ganon-and-zelda-story-positioning-using-open-air-concept-in-the-future/) most likely
115574,"Having Ganon appear multiple times is no indicator for timeline placement. We dont play the Zelda titles in either correct order or chronology. There can (and will be) Zelda stories/adventures we dont know yet, future games. Then there can be more fights and stories in the history of Hyrule where we wont get a game. Because there are no more games in Adult Timeline where we fight Ganon doesn't mean he does not appear multiple times, we simply don't know."
