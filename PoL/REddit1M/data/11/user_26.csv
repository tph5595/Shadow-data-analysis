7643,"[Here you are](https://imgur.com/gallery/32Ukq)


There's one hiding in the crease of the page. Looks like a blue Hinox maybe. Between Ridgeland Tower and the black hinox to the south east. "
8315,[Heres a map](https://imgur.com/gallery/32Ukq) I posted of all the Sub bosses. Lynels are in there too. 
8476,"Spoiler tag is [spoiler name (/spoiler) without spaces before parenthesis and add ] after ""name""



So that looks like [spoiler name](/spoiler). "
10065,"Stalnox is a skeleton Hinox. It has 1000 HP. It's killed similar to Hinox, but you need to [hit its eye at the end to kill it](/spoiler)


Malduga is a giant sand worm. 1500 HP. "
13162,"You're welcome! I haven't fought any, but I think normal lynels have 2000HP. I'm not sure if they're harder or not, but I'd think so. 

Either way, good luck :)"
14164,They're head gear pieces 
20593,Post the numbers please 
21421,[Here's](https://imgur.com/gallery/moeQ7) a map of where all the dragons spawn :)
25303,You need to follow it pretty far down. You'll know when to stop because it goes into a little alcove in the river. You need to blow up two different things. Just get there before the letter. The end is just past a large bokoblin camp
26878,"The fountains should spawn more fairies every so often. And [miphas grace](/spoiler) should automatically activate when you die and override fairies. 

I'd try quitting out of BotW and turning off then on the console. Try turning off and back on [miphas grace](/spoiler) too if that doesn't work. 


Edit: mrfortunes answer makes much more sense than mine so nevermind"
27457,Are you sure you're resetting and not just doing sleep mode?
33005,"It might be you have too many. Someone else said you can only have 4 which seems right to me. Try using one then going to a fountain. 


Did you figure out the other thing?"
33085,[Here's a map](https://imgur.com/gallery/moeQ7) showing all the dragon routes. 
33303,"No. There's 6 spaces for saves. The game will auto save over the oldest save. 

If you want to have two games at once, make a new profile for the second person "
35684,Hmm strange. Sorry I couldn't help. I haven't done that one yet. Almost froze to death trying and haven't been back since I got new gear. 
36566,"Since there's so many, probably not. If you tell me specifically what you're looking for I can tell you where. Or if you'd rather, I can post the full list of ingredients and where to find them. There's just no map. It'd probably be so cluttered with things unless it was digital. "
39448,"You mean fight ganon is marked as incomplete, but you already did?


If yes, the game will always put you before the ganon fight even after you beat it. You should have a star on your file now. "
40656,"What's the rest of the clue? I think I had different clues (or I forgot about this one). 


The first thing that comes to mind is durian"
42457,"Oh wow I completely forgot there were pumpkins in this game lol. I did have that clue, but I figured it out because of the kakarikos special fruit part  "
42687,Awesome! I haven't even attempted a regular Hinox lol. But congratulations :)
42810,They're talking about the [camera rune](/spoiler). 
52151,"If you use the [camera rune](/spoiler), link and hearts are not in the shot. I'm not sure if you can view them completely full screen and I can't check because I'm not home. But I think that's your best bet"
52470,"Don't know about 1, but for 2- they're just rare. You can get them in shrine chests or from guardians. Because every enemy respawns infinitely, no materials are limited. "
52848,"1. Depending on the enemy type and weapon type, they can. That's why there are so many weapons around so you can easily replace ones you've lost. To me it seems like it may be based on amount of hits and higher power weapons are more durable. So if you're fighting a 100 HP enemy with a 10 damage weapon, it'll take 10 hits. Maybe that weapon only can stand 30-40 hits. But a 30 damage weapon would be only 4 hits. Even if it can only take 30-40 hits also, it'd still last longer. I'm not 100% sure how durability works, but that's how it seems to me. May also be based on weapon type. 


Not sure about 2"
54655,Visit the tall glowing orange towers. They'll fill in your map for each region 
54719,"I'm not home so I can't check, but another commentator said you can. Not sure if it's true though "
55353,"Here's what they are:
112. [silver moblin, found in greater hyrule](/spoiler)

124. [silver lynel](/spoiler) [Heres a map to find that one](https://imgur.com/gallery/32Ukq)

136. [master kohga found in yiga clan hideout](/spoiler)


Next 4 are divine beast bosses:

161. final boss spoiler: [dark beast ganon](/spoiler)

319. [bow of light, ""available in a boss battle"" might mean final boss](/spoiler) possibly final boss spoiler?


Have you seen all these before? Maybe if you haven't encountered something, you can't buy the picture?"
58586,"Ugh. I also forgot to get the first two bosses. I thought you could buy them too. Hmm. 


Let me know if you figure out how to buy them! And you're welcome! I'm glad I could help. "
58903,Good luck! :)
79486,[Here](https://imgur.com/a/P9M7m) you go!
94956,You're welcome! I'm glad that I could help! Let me know if there's any other things you need :)
