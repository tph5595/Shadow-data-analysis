28487,Yes. You only need the hearts the first time. 
28560,Yes. But Nintendo said today that there's an error in the Switch GPU that's going to be fixed in a future update that they say will improve overall performance. 
31932,Smash Link is probably the easiest amiibo to find. 
31975,"Yes, but you can't register them. "
32106,"This isn't quite true. Each fairy can upgrade a certain amount. For example, the Kakariko Fairy can only ever upgrade to 2 stars. "
32324,"Having finished all of those quests, I didn't get a sword from it. Only a shrine. "
32987,I've found every Great Fairy and I'm literally talking to the Kakariko Fairy as we speak and she can only go to 2 stars. 
33223,Yes. 
37984,"Kill every animal you see. I thought it was a waste of arrows, but now I'm full on cooked meals and have over 50 of all the meats. Rhinos and moose are the best, and wolves usually travel in packs. "
38055,"Beetle always has arrows, but other than that shops seem to restock every few days (possibly related to the Blood Moon). "
38138,"A Link to the Past, Ocarina of Time 3D, or possibly Breath of the Wild (though I don't know if BotW would be good because it would give a false impression of the rest of the series). "

47222,I beat that dude and wanted his sword but it vanished as soon as he died.
47250,No crouching required for them. 
52968,You can sell special armors to any vendor for 600 rupees. You can get it back from a certain vendor in a side quest. 
53091,"You can wear anything you want as long as no Gerudo can see you. If you're not wearing the whole set and you get spotted, you get kicked out. This includes changing pants. "
