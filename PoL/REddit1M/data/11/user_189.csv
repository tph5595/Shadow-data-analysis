81372,"Do Guardians and mid-level bosses (like the rock monster things and Lynels) respawn with the Blood Moons?

And the flying Guardians around Akkala Tower....what's their deal? I hit one with an ancient arrow and nothing happened. Then I shield deflected its beam at least six times, but only about a third of its health went down. What am I doing wrong here?

Also what's the best way to get ancient cores? Just by chance? I've searched at least 50 dead Guardians, killed maybe 15, and have gotten every material except it. Am I just really unlucky?"
