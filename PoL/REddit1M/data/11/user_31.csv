8748,"What's the best 'combat' armor set that's usable before the endgame? I have level 3 stealth armor which is decent but I want to be able to fight guardians so I was thinking of buying and upgrading the ancient set. 

Also - what's a good way to farm rupees and ancient materials for that purpose?"
