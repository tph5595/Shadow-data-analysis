71347,"Am I going crazy or is Ancient Arrow damage incredibly inconsistent? It takes 3 arrows to kill the big legged dudes but I found a place with a bunch of decayed ones and it still took 3 hits. The big legged ones have 1500 hp as confirmed from the champions tunic and the decayed ones only have 500 and these did too, I checked, so the arrows should kill them in one shot but it doesn't. even when I got a crit right in the eye, they still needed 3 hits. Do ancient arrows just do 1/3 damage to guardians because I swore I had fought some decayed ones before and it only taking 1 shot. "
