21966,"How long into the game do you have to get before you can start the Memory quests? 

Edit: missed a word"
22526,Alright. My Wii U took a crap on me and I'm borrowing one from a friend for the weekend and was hoping to get to do some of the memory quests because they sound intriguing 
38008,Easy way to ~~tame~~ get horses? Easy sneaking items? I can't do it :\^( 
38490,How much is the armor? I just got off the plateau about an hour ago and only have like 60 rupees 
45314,"Thanks for the help. I managed to get a horse after knocking it's Bokoblin rider off. He didn't try to run or anything, and the stable says his affection or whatever was maxed out.

49886,What 5 meats does it have to be? Or can it just be 5 of the same meats?
60942,I'm trying to make these. I use a combo of Raw Bird Legs and Raw Meat and it only makes Meat Skewers that are only selling for 120... What do?
107294,Nope.. Still not working for me... I even tried throwing a piece prime meat into it and all that did was raise the regen by 2 and raise the selling price to 140... 
110865,Boars dropped regular old Raw Meat... I cook up 5 of them in a pot at the same time it is giving me a regular old Meat Skewer that is only selling for 120... I'm doing it exactly how you are saying
