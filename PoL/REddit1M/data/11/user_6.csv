1927,"It used to happen every once in a while at night.   But now it happens almost every single night and it happens multiple times that night as well.  Plus I'll hear the music for the blood moon during the day sometimes.  When it happens multiple times it will happen at like 9pm, midnight and 2am.  Then the next night 8pm and midnight. It's never consistent.

This happening to anyone else?  It's getting kind of annoying."

I also. Prices once last night, and this is the only time this has happened, was a 1 second pause in the game.  Like the game just hung for a second or two and then continued running.  That and the one time my pro controller lost sync have been my only ""problems"" to have happen with the switch so far.  BOTW has ruined every other video game in existence though.  I haven't been this impressed with a video game since I played the original legend of zelda when I was a kid."
