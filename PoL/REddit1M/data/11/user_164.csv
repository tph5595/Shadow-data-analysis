60095,"My brother and I share the Switch but play BotW on separate profiles/logins, but do we also share amiibo drops? What I mean is that he scanned the Link amiibo and got Epona on the first scan, and I've been reloading and scanning everyday since launch and have yet to get Epona. Did he scan the only Epona drop for the entire console or are each profiles independent with amiibo data?"
