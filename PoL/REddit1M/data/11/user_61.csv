21595,"I stumbled upon a colossal hole in the ground in the Gerudo Highlands â€” directly southeast of Kuh Takkar Shrine and immediately south of Vatorsa Snowfield. It's hidden under a grassy overhang and surrounded by Sheikah lanterns and traditional Japanese ritualistic ribbons. The music also changes when you approach it, and jumping into it voids you out and you re spawn at the top. It's really deep; bombs just disappear if you drop them into it.

It almost looks as though there's supposed to be a gladiatorial fight or a massive worm boss that pops out. Arrows have no effect on the lanterns, and there's a spot that looks like a door on the wall but it's blocked behind a stone. Does anyone know what this is? Or is there a snowball hiding way above the ravine that you're supposed to roll into it?"
22500,Makes sense. Can you give me a hint as to where I might look to trigger it?
