36337,"There's a variety of lynels in the game. On top of following the color code, they may use Sword and Shield, Spears, or Greatswords as their weapon.

Sword and Shield lynels are the easiest to fight, as their melee attacks are easy to evade, thus triggernig the matrix attack spam. 

Two hander lynels on the other hand, are more annoying.  They'll attack at you by jumping and lunging at you, and they'll produce a small AoE. This makes using the same trick as against Sword and Shield lynels unviable. 

Lynels have two magical attacks and their arrow pew pew thing. Anytime you see them roar, just run fast away - they're about to launch a big fire AoE. If you see them charging a small fire ball in their mouth, just run in circles around the lynel until its done (usually 3 balls, but sometimes might be just 1 supercharged shot).

Do note that Lynels will only use their bows at long distance, and as such, you should at all times face them at melee or near-melee range. If the Lyneel doesn't see you but you're within range, they have the ability to shoot a volley into the sky - you'll be smitted."

Also, you can cook them in batches by throwing 5 at a fire, instead of cooking them at a stove."

Something like that? Otherwise the answer is no."
