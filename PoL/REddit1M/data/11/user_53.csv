19315,So I'm gonna answer this and also post a question and answer it just to get the news across because farming the way of just standing on a mountain at night hoping for them was personally a huge turn off in trying to get maxed out gear. There's a lynel in the coliseum ruins near hyrule castle that for sure can drop star fragments. The first time I killed him he dropped two. I'm not sure about other lynels dropping them but the one in the coliseum definitely does.
19435,For anyone wanting star fragments or questioning if standing on a mountain at night hoping to see one is the only way I know for certain they can drop from the lynel in the coliseum ruins near hyrule castle. First time I killed him he dropped two at one time. Way faster and way more fun than standing on a mountain at night waiting forever.
19746,He's to the right of the great deku tree in the middle of the lost woods. If you go north from hyrule castle you'll find it most likely.
20707,No prob. It's fairly hard to miss. If you can take the long route around hyrule castle to the left or right it'll be the huge foresty area that's above it on the map. It's well worth going there as soon as you can manage it.
