23091,"The Champion's Tunic is the strongest chest piece at 32 defense, but has no set bonus, and its added effect is just that you can see enemy HP, rather than something directly useful in combat.  

The Soldier's armor has max defense otherwise at 28 defense per piece, but has no set bonus or added effect.  

The ancient set matches this at 28 defense per piece, but also has the added effect of guardian resistance and the set bonus of doing extra damage with ancient weapons.  For those reasons, I'd say it's the best combat armor available.  

The Barbarian armor is also decent, as it gives you a constant third level attack buff, but you can get this on top of your ancient gear with mighty bananas, so might as well skip it.  

As for ancient materials, fight the walker guardians in Hyrule field and the Major test of strength shrine enemies.  For the highest level, you'll need star fragments which may fall from the sky, or drop from high level Lynels.  "
23208,"I did the headquarters quest with high-tier armor and lots of hearts and still got one shot (and they seemed to have a ton of hp).  

The environmental ones aren't threats at all.  I think it's an attempt to force a stealth section. "

23493,"I wanted the Master Sword, so I upgraded health only till I had 13 hearts, and then went stamina only till I maxed it out.  

I realize I could have respec'd, but this was more straightforward.
