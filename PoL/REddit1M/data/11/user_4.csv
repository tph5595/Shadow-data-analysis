5199,its easier to replace hearts on the go than stamina. I know theres foods to cook but you have to do extra work to cook them . i do stamina over hearts. just keep eating. but thats me 
6423,"Ok, so what do I do with these korok seeds ?"
6712,"do you HAVE to take pictures of everything ?, whats the purpose ?"
15416,"you can drop food next to your fire to cook it. apples , peppers, etc. but not together no. so when you see a cooking pot, you better cook all your shit at once"
15587,how can I upgrade my outfits again ?  going to the fairy but they are greyed out and have question marks on them so i dont know what i need to upgrade them. are there different faires that do dif things ?
56386,"thunder blight ganon ? the devine beast ? I just beat him, hes tough but its easy,....first, make sure you got plenty of back up hearts ready. first phase is you block with shield when he zig zags at you, then hit him a couple times with the sword til his shield breaks, then hit him again....second phase get your magnesis ready. go up top and when those metal spikes come down grab one of them and hold it til it charges then touch him with it. ...third phase is like 1st but its way harder. just run the whole time, he will be elecric at this point, dont do anything, wait for him to not be electric and then hit him when you can. ( i used stop time ruin for this) then boom, youre done. if he comes with you with laser just hide behind a pillar"
56833,"not that this helps , but I just mark my map with a leaf when I see things like radishes , you can come back to it later and they should re spawn. another example is fire lizards are right before goron city, so just mark the map when you see a lot of shit you see "
56922,when I buy all the shit in one store I just fast travel to another 
57150,how do you get diamonds . trying to repair the weapons from the blacksmith people
57938,I know theres a rusty sword on that little cake looking island near temple of time. you can fight little tiny guardians in shrines to get their blue acient guardian swords. also defeating them will get you a core and shafts and shit. always keep a couple of each type of weapon. 
58196,"you just have to be on the lookout, theres swords everywhere too, enemies drop them when defeated, theres a daggar here and there . hard to remember exactly "
