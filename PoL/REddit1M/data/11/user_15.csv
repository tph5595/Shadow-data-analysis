4467,Do you put your console in sleep mode when you're done playing? I was having a lot of trouble and someone suggested doing a hard shut down of the console. It worked for me and my blood moons happen pretty infrequently now. Before I was getting 2-3 events in a single fight.
5248,"When the Old Man suggests cutting down a tree, I think he warns that you need to be pointed in the right direction. If your trees fell down, then your angle was off. You can see that as poor game design, but you likely won't have much fun moving forward. I see it as designed exactly right, because you actually have complete control over where the tree falls. 

A lot of this game requires skill to play. It is hard. But the fact that things actually do what you make them do is a strength of the game.

And for what it's worth, you can climb sideways on the cliff face toward the little camp to the north."
5611,"On top of climbing horizontally toward the north, as I suggested in my other reply, you absolutely can climb vertically with the starting stamina wheel. It's how I got to the shrine - I'm assuming you came from the other side if you've gotten stuck. 

You have to climb without jumping, and you have to look ahead and plan out where you are going to climb to next."
6507,You control which way the tree falls by cutting it from exactly the opposite side. 
7362,There's nothing in this game that you have to do except beat Ganon. Everything else is for fun.
7447,Sometimes you can see the giant bulbs from high places. You might also find villagers or travelers that know about them.
7523,"Just outside of Kakariko village there is someone who is interested in them, but will only tell you that after you help them get something they've lost."
8852,Every merchant I've dealt with has bought ore from me. Are you sure they won't buy from you? Try it again.
10111,The main quest does not take you to the Master Sword.
10980,Have you gotten the hints from the Zora about it? 
12511,"""A gift from the sky, A scale of light, Splits the feet, Of a veiled falls sight""

What do you think a **scale of light** refers to, relevant to the zora and the cermony? And how might that become a gift from the sky?"
13584,There is a guy who appears at different towns and stables that will look at your pictures and point you to where they are.
15845,You can only upgrade to the number of stars equal to the number of fairies you've found. 
17274,"Nope! You're fine. 

Edit to add: You can change the quest that your map points you to by going to your inventory and pressing L. You can do the quests however you like or not at all."
20269,"Regarding 1: I accidentally dropped it into the desert, but immediately realized that I could have tried [using magnesis to get it swinging, then cut the rope while it's swinging toward you](/spoiler)"
20420,"[Just east of Farosh Hills, north of the Faron label on the map when you zoom out all the way.](/spoiler)"
25913,Do you have the correct arrow type equipped? 
26059,"Yes. You can go out looking for them, or just find them passively as you explore, or ignore the quest completely. "
27626,Where are you dying? Does it happen to be inside of a shrine?
27932,"Are you sure? And are you sure that you purchased the right kind of arrows? Are you checking from your inventory, or from trying to nock an arrow? Can you check again? EDIT: A few more: Where did you buy 60 arrows? Were they all the same type or did you buy a variety?

The answer is either ""There is confusion or error on your end"" or ""You have experienced a gamebreaking bug that nobody else has reported"" so forgive me for asking stupid questions before eliminating the former as a possibility. "
28265,"Yes, the four special abilities cannot be used in shrines. If you'll indulge me, would you mind intentionally dying in the overworld to see what happens? First, check the inventory to make sure that it is not cooling down.

The only explanation I can think of right now is that it *did* activate for you at one point, but you didn't notice (it can be easily missed if you're focused on a battle) and then the time that you noticed dying and getting a fairy was during the cooldown period."
28829,"It's really just capture cards. They're not hard to get, and relatively inexpensive compared to the console itself."
28980,"&gt;I tried to leave to get more supplies but it won't let me leave.

Go to the warp point where you entered. You can leave from there. (I believe there is a button you can press from your map screen too, but I could be wrong and can't go back to check.)"
30867,I don't think you can get a haircut. There is a variety of headgear that changes your hairstyle though.
32693,"It is completely true. I am at the Kakariko fairy right now, able to upgrade my 3-star Barbarian Armor to 4-star. All of the great fairies are equivalent.

This is why, when you run out of the necessary loot to upgrade your gear, she says ""Come see me after you've found my sisters."" "
33137,"So, when you talk to her, your 2-star equipment shows question marks? "

I can definitely upgrade to 4 stars from the Kakariko Village Fairy. And that is consistent with what she says, which is to come talk to her when you have found her sisters. "
54688,You have to find other towers like the one in the Plateau area. Each one unlocks the map for their respective region.
