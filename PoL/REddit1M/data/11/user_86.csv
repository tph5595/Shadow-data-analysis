28366,"Trying to get Ancient Gears so that I can buy the Ancient Armor set. I know that the Rito in Tarrey Town sells 1 at a time. Does anyone know how long it takes for that to respawn? 

Also trying to kill some Guardians to get them, but wasn't there a travelling merchant who sold Guardian parts?"
