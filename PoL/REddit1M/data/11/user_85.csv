28263,"[SPOILERS] [repost from an earlier thread. My question never got answered... Maybe more people have beaten the game and can help me] Hey guys, I just beat the game, and I made sure to get both endings, and I just got the second ending but for some reason my Adventure Log says 13/15 Main Quests Cleared. There's only one quest available and it's to finish the game. Any ideas on why I only have 14 quests listed?

97715,I did do that. Already passed that quest.
590592,"I figured it out. I was missing the quest to turn in for the Fairy Fountain.
I'll put a list of the main quests here in spoilers for others for future reference. I couldn't find it anywhere online.
