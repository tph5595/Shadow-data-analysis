8036,"Guys I'm in a bit of a rut. 

I've been to Kakariko village got the quests to get the 4 divine beasts and I've activated the camera on my Sheikah stone. I've done a fair few side quests but in all honesty I'm really struggling and I feel massively underpowered. I tried doing the side quest to clear the beach near the lab place and just keep getting owned. 

Have I missed some easy stuff to do? Where can I get better weapons :(. I've been round Hateno village too but once I got the three trees quest I just got owned by the cold. 

I feel like there's nothing I can do that doesn't take me to places where I won't get instagibbed. 

I know I need to Git Gud. But honestly can anyone help guide me a bit more. Are there places I can go to get better weapons or am I really just running straight for divine beasts already? I'm worried because I get smashed by the combat trials so and can't even clear the beach side quest ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Just feeling frustrated rly. "

I've done a ton of shrines and activated towers in 4 continents. I just get owned whenever I do the combat shrines.
