However, I've ran into the problem where I haven't see much electrified Chuchus and I got both shrines in the jungle and the puzzle area with the four colored spheres that had constant lightning weather before learning you could force normal Chu Jelly to change ""elements"" by putting it in fire for red, in snow for blue and under the thunder for yellow.

So yup, is there a place with constant/often seen stormy weather? Or, is there a place with a lot of electrified Chuchus?"

I've personally gotten it before doing any dungeons since I saw my boyfriend do the Zora one with a particular character mentioning Link didn't have his ""sword that seals the darkness"". I was happy to see the text changes a bit if you have the Master Sword. :)"
