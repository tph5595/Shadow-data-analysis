22135,IIRC it starts in the first 1-2 missions after getting off the great plateau.
22640,Yes
26657,"1. There's some max amount you can have. I couldn't have more than 4 at a time since they would stop spawning or I just couldn't grab them for some reason, but they were always there when I needed more.

2. [Is it on cooldown?](/spoiler)"
26738,Nope.
27095,"I believe it's identical to the food/elixir boost. That gives a +20%, +30%, or +50% damage bonus depending on the strength of the boost."
28699,It should. You can test it out by using the champion shirt to look at an enemy's health before and after hitting them.
28861,Did you talk to the painter at kakariko for the fairy fountain quest? It's considered a main quest for some reason
29805,"They're very durable (much moreso than you are) so they're unlikely to die unless you end up hitting them. Using a 22 damage weapon:

1-star strength: 4 hits to kill (66-88 hp)    
4-star strength: 11 hits to kill (220-244 hp)

Further testing brought the 4-star down to 220-225 hp, so I suspect it's just 225 hp with 1-star having 75 hp. It might be something like base 1-star = 75 hp with each additional star giving +50 hp.

Regardless, I always rode my 1-star horse around just to keep my better horses safe. It's survived things that 1-shot me, it's survived being stunlocked by a yellow chu chu, and it's survived various other scary situations. I think the health resets whenever you summon them to a stable (my usual horse had the same life as one I never use), so I don't think there's anything to worry about if my 1-star horse could handle that much abuse and still live."
32530,"There's a few things you can do with it. You can sell it like any other ore, [you can trade 10 for a diamond, or you can use it to buy a specific armor set at a hidden shop.](/spoiler)"
33822,"It doesn't have to be lightning specifically. You can just drop a bunch of other chu chu jellies, drop a single yellow chu chu jelly, then fire an arrow at the yellow one to detonate it and convert the rest to yellow."
34055,[It's at the Gerudo town. Visit the bar for a lead.](/spoiler)
34978,"Ocarina of Time is the classic ""you must play this"" game, but I'm going with two other titles instead (please don't kill me!)

Either A Link Between Worlds or BoTW. Going with BoTW means you can also ride the new release hype train for a fantastic game, but ALBW is also great while being a more traditional experience that doesn't directly compete with the 3D titles."
35178,You may have run into a similar situation in Hateno village.
35341,"[I don't know about a specific time, but you can see a blue glow above the mountain from other areas when it's like that. Also no, you can't.](/spoiler)"
35457,[The zora place](/spoiler)
38218,"I did the southwest area first after clearing all the towers and memories. It seems to be considered the hardest, but you should definitely be able to handle it.

Slight reward spoilers: [the zora reward is probably the least impressive imo](/spoiler)"
38394,"The armor from kakariko is a good buy overall, but you should be able to just crouch-walk behind horses just fine unless they turn. If all else fails, just glider over to them and land on one."
38471,No
38638,1800 total. There are materials around kakariko that you can cook for a sneaking boost though.
40210,You'll see a cooldown timer once you use all the charges.
42768,"Only if you have them enabled, otherwise that rune doesn't appear in the list."
45075,"[""The walls have ears""](/spoiler)"
57306,The easiest way is [to get luminous stones and trade 10 with one of the Zoras for a diamond \(2 diamonds the first time\). Maybe talus also drop them idk](/spoiler)
60978,NPCs just get knocked out until the fight is over if they get beat up too much.
65974,On the loading screen right under your spirit orbs.
66117,"There's a shield surfing minigame up on the hebra mountains (northwest). The best reward is a royal shield, but it's hanging up on the wall before you earn it if you just need a picture."
121964,"Do you mind listing the quests that do appear? The only thing I can think of is that you might have skipped starting the ""Reach Zora's Domain"" quest by going straight there instead of visiting Inogo Bridge."
