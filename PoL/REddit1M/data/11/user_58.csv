20369,"1) The way I got the hanging chest was to use the magnet to lift it toward me, such that when I let it go, it would swing backward, then swing back toward myself.

After you let go of the chest, immediately switch to the stasis ability and freeze the chest when it is swinging toward you with some upward momentum. While it's frozen, you shoot the rope with an arrow.

If you do it correctly, the chest should land on the floor. It took me several tries to get right and not have the chest bounce off and fall over the edge though."
