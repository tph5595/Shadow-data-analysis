28184,So I'm pretty under equipped to fight water blight Gannon and I can't kill him. I tried to leave to get more supplies but it won't let me leave. I get him down to the last quarter of health pretty easily. Then I run out of arrows. The bad part is that's where he floats and I can't melee him. I have about 13 shock arrows and 1 bomb arrow. Any strategies that could help me beat him? I have a couple spears and two totally healthy 20 damage swords.
