36961,"Hey, so after 30 hours and a ruthless 'fine comb' style of exploration, I am finally ready to get back on the quest. Only, the game really seems to be pushing [Zoras Domain and Mipha](/spoiler) and I don't really want to do that . Every streamer I have seen went there first and its loot looks to make the game a lot easier. So coming from a guy who has [beat Eventide, Lynels, and has close to 90 korok seeds with only 5 hearts](/spoiler) which divine beast should I go for?"
