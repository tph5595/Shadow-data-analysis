You play how you want, everything is to be expected in this game. "
38044,"I think you should go for some shrines first, for every 4 you finish, you can get an extra heart or more stamina. 

I chose to do the Gerudo divine beast first, and deeply regretted my decision. I have now beaten all divine beasts and wish I did Zoras Domain first, but the decision is all yours. "
38189,"Apples. 

Keep at least 20 spare, so you can spam cook single apples during blood moon, giving 4 hearts each, quadrupling health restored. "
38264,They'll restock over time. 
38284,But... He overcharges.... By like one rupee.

Use the special sword and statis+, stasis makes guardians forget about you so you can use it when they're about to fire, get close up, chop their legs off and keep attacking. 

When you're near a guardian, the special sword will increase to 60 damage. 

Below Tarrey town there are 2 guardians, and is a good area for fighting them. "
38785,As I'm sure you're now aware (I'm saying this for other people) the master sword will always come back to you in a few minutes.

45326,"And you're more than welcome to. In my opinion, It's up to personal preference. They're all very useful. 
In my case, I haven't had any need for that ability, but I have needed the Zora ability a lot. "
45494,Any idea how many hearts you get from cooking 5 at once? I've got 4...
