56685,I've been getting blood moons extremely frequently lately and its pretty annoying. I'm not sure if my game is bugged or something but I get two blood moons almost every night. At this point its honestly rare for me not to have a blood moon and it basically makes it not worth fighting anything at night because it just respawns everything even if I'm in combat with them. Is there a fix for this or this just normal?
