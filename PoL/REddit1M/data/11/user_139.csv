46421,You can collect the memories left for you in the Sheikah Slate.
46524,"While it isn't possible for just any piece of armour, I think you can wear whatever pants you want inside the town. I tried on some new boots in town and I wasn't kicked out."
46756,"It depends on what you're using. With I think 5 Big Hearty Radishes it's possible to get +25 or +30 yellow hearts... Durians I believe are around +15. Not home to check.

Also good to note that anything that gives you yellow hears also fully restores your normal health too."
47130,"If you look on your map, Medoh should be on there. Select the mark and you should teleport back in. "
49526,Nope
49697,"No worries! Just keep in mind how many heart containers you have. There's no point making a +25 for example if you have 15 heart containers. Since you can only have a maximum 30 hearts, you'd be wasting 10 bonus hearts, and the ingredients to make them. Work out how to get the most out of your ingredients."
50034,"I haven't found a specific Royal Guard set or anything. Depending on how you dyed certain pieces of armour you might be able to get one looking close, but there likely isn't a set."
56342,"There isn't any moblins in the plateau.... You want to look at the Outpost Ruins and the other ruins directly east of the plateau. Normal Moblins spawn there.

EDIT: u/exkali13ur read this if you haven't"
57788,"Trading 10 Luminous Stones for a Diamond is an easy way... Diamonds also have a rare chance of dropping from a high level Stone Talus or a Rare Ore Deposit.

EDIT: Clarity"
59995,"In a certain town you can get accessories and jewellery made from certain gems. The same gems are used to upgrade the accessories as well. Besides that, the gems are used for upgrading different parts of armour, and Diamonds are used to reforge certain weapons when they break."
60201,"Epona and the like are just really rare chances... You can get another Epona for yourself, your brother just got really lucky."
63303,"There's a Gerudo Scimitar next to the shop at the Kara Kara Bazaar... As for a shield, if you just need a picture of it, there are a few Gerudos traveling in between the town and the Bazaar that'll have one on their backs."
65798,"I managed to find a Royal Shield on a Black Moblin on Tingel Island, to the eastern side of the map. Only one I've found so far, but I'd presume there's others."
66119,"Ancient arrows are a one hit, but I find they're way harder to hit than a standard Guardian because of how they move. Otherwise, just keep hitting it with whatever you can reach it with and wear down its health."
66490,No worries! It stood out to me because I went practically the whole game without finding one. I'm glad I could help!
68265,You can still loot Guardians. They explode first like they do when they die instead of just disappearing like other enemies.
72691,"Are you absolutely sure you're getting them in the eye? The Ancient Arrows definitely one-hit every kind of Guardian... Decayed, Stalker etc. when it's a critical hit."
72812,"First you need to tame a horse. After that, take it to a stable and register it with them for 20 rupees. When you've done that, you can pick it up from any stable in the game. There is a maximum distance for whistling for your horse... It has to be somewhere feasible for it to reach. It won't run halfway across Hyrule for you. However, if you leave it somewhere in the world, you can get it back instantly from a stable."
72959,"I've thought I've gotten it in the eye a few times and it turns out I haven't... There's no inconsistency in damage, just aim."
73281,Pretty sure it's based off the time and date settings of the Switch/Wii U. No idea whether or not daylight savings affects it.
73914,"It should be okay... Try again in a few hours, otherwise it'll be working fine tomorrow."
74824,"I'm not entirely sure on whether it adds or not, but I know that some locations (eg. the Springs of Power, Wisdom and Courage) and a few other areas don't automatically show on your map upon getting a tower. To get those locations on your map, you have to visit them. Maybe they're the ones it means."
75053,"Yeah, they have heaps of use. Without going into too much detail, there's a second research lab where you can basically buy special weapons and armour using them. You'll need a lot, so it's good to save them.

EDIT: This armour also needs Guardian parts to upgrade, so you'll need even more."
75999,No worries!
