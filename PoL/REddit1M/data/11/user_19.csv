6197,"Aye, I also did The Rito next and it worked out well for me. Revali's Gale is a godsend for exploring."
6524,"Hmm. There's the upgrades you can get in Akkala, including the armour you don't want. I'm certain I've encountered a side quest or two that needed them as well, but I can't think of where they are. When I get home I will check my side quest list and see if I can find them. "
8945,"Every merchant will buy Armor, Materials and Food. Ore is a material so it can definitely be sold to everyone.

However, there is a Gerudo in Goron city who will buy a random piece of ore in stacks of 10 for better prices than merchants. "
9073,"They one shot me while in the hideout, but since then when I encounter them in the wild they just take a decent chunk. I'm not sure if that's a gameplay mechanic to force stealth in the hideout or I just beefed my hearts up a lot in the interim though.

Either way they're fairly easy to dodge and parry in a one v one fight."
9198,"Head for Zora's domain. I avoided most fights on the way there, and the reward you get for completing the dungeon is fantastic for keeping you alive in tougher fights early one.

Also buy the Hylian outfit in Kakariko Village. It's easy to upgrade and offers good defensive values, especially early on. "
10418,Do you have a name for it? I went to Zora's domain first so I'm drawing a blank currently on which one you're referring to. 
10691,As far as I can tell the Champion's Tunic is the strongest chest piece in the game. At max level it has a whopping 32 armour rating. If paired with the Hylian Hood and Trousers (very cheap to upgrade) it's a good set for mid game combat. 
15157,"There is a painter who can give you more of an idea of where to go. You can find him in Kakariko Village first, then he will appear at various stables. "
17236,"Oh that one. There's a Zora in the domain who can offer more information. If you're still lost after that, report back here. "
17328,"So I decided to buy a bunch of the Compendium pictures, but there's around ten missing still after buying all of them. Anyone know what I need to do to get them? The guy in the research lab just hinted that they're hidden. I can list the numbers here if necessary. "
52050,"112, 124, 136, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 319. "
57351,"Shiiiiit. I completely forgot to get the four bosses or the master. I swear I read someone bought the photos of the bosses because they'd missed them. Maybe I need to beat the final boss first? 

Thanks for filling me in though."
58705,"Currently I'm gonna take a run at Gabon and see if beating the game makes a difference. I was going to wait until I had every shrine, but 94 is good enough I figure."
63083,"So I've cleared Hyrule castle and I'm heading for the top, but I also checked GameFAQs and people there are talking about an Elite Enemies tab becoming available. I haven't gotten confirmation as to how you get this, but I'm assuming beating the game will do it. "
68608,"So did you find him or not? Your first comment implies you have, while your second comment implies you haven't. "
83631,"Search the trail southish of Goron City and you
might find help along the way.

Edit important spelling."
84236,Mine seem to tick over at midnight. I have not done any extensive testing however. For reference I'm AEDT currently. 
84727,"Firstly yes, every enemy except for 5 respawn (I can tell you the five but don't want needless spoilers).

With flying guardians I'm not sure. I only started using the shield parry late in the game so I just smashed them with magnesis or arrows.

With ancient cores your best bet is shrine chests. I occasionally get them from stalkers, but most of my collection came from doing shrines.  "
