26456,"Does the fairy fountain ever respawn more fairies? It’s been empty since I activated it, and my wife hasn’t had any trouble finding them there on her account.

Also why is [Mipha’s Grace](/spoiler) not activating when I have it turned on? Every source I’ve found says that it will override a fairy - so why do I lose a fairy when I die, rather than having it activate?"
27358,"Thanks for the response. This has been happening for a few irl days now, so the game/system's been turned off several times. Not sure :/"
27535,"Thanks for the response. The most I've ever had was the three that I caught the first time I found the fountain, so maybe that's why they're not spawning anymore.

Also, it's never triggered for me once. It's enabled in my inventory screen and the HUD shows the white elephant icon so I don't think that's it. My wife is playing in the same room, and it literally just activated for her the first time, so I guess it's just me lol"
27705,"I think so - I hold the power button on the console/screen, and go to ""power options"" to turn it off. Maybe I have too many fairies already, so the game doesn't want to give any more? It's no big deal, just wondering what I was doing wrong."
27846,"I have died in a shrine, but the inventory screen says it's disabled, so I guess it doesn't apply there? I did also die to a Guardian laser in the ""open world"" and it used a fairy. It's no big deal, just wondering what I was doing wrong."
