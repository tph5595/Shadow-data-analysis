26694,I have 2 pieces of the barbarian set. Does anyone know how much effectiveness each rank of Attack+ has? Like how the weapons say Attack+6. The Attack+ bonus of these barbarian items don't give a specific number.
28208,"Oh ok. So the bonus scales with the weapon you're using then? So if I'm using a weapon with a power of 30, my 2 barbarian pieces effectively make it 39?"
73022,Am I unable to scan my amiibos today because of daylight savings time? &gt;=[
73731,Yeah it says I cant scan today again. Im assuming that its because the time on the device changed. Daily events in some DS games had the same restriction.
