45358,They're used by the game to clear the cache of which enemies you've defeated. If you defeat a ton of mobs/camps you'll easily trigger a blood moon. 
45436,"The dragons do not spawn every night and they are more likely to spawn if you are not in the area. They only spawn around midnight apparently, too. "
45938,There is a Hylian Soldier armor set for purchase in Hateno's clothing store.
