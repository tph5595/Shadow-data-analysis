52092,"I'm reading this whole post, shaking my head going, ""Y'all are reading too much into it. Nintendo just makes a new Zelda game every couple of years and the creators are inspired by the games that came before it.""  All the talk of chronology and timeline--the writers of the game don't care and they can't be bothered because their main goal is to tell their own complete story. The writers of these Historia are totally different people--likely fans--who are working on a fun project using their imagination to hook it all together. I played the first Zelda in 1986 and never once worried about continuity. "

But beyond direct references within the games ( I concede that point), I think it's kind of pointless to be trying to figure out if (for instance) the NES version comes before or after Oracle of Seasons. Speaking as a geek of things, it's fun to nerd out about for sure, but I can't get hung up on it when things don't line up. I'd be willing to bet the developers aren't thinking as much about timeline as they are about mechanics and creating the new world. 

I think the point of those games is that the character is Link and your soul inhabits him--you are reincarnated within Link--with every new game you play. 

The BotW questions *I* have though, are that if Link was put into suspended animation, did that screw up the reincarnation of he and Zelda's souls every 100 years? Are there two Links right now? And why are they talking about the Goddess Hylia? I thought there were three goddesses, Din, Nayru, and Farore. And where's the Triforce in all of this?  Some of these questions I may figure out as I continue plugging through the game. "
85441,LA LA LA!!  I apparently need to give Skyward Sword another chance. I just read something on a wiki I shouldn't have about the Goddess Hylia. 
184324,"BotW playtime can be very misleading, I bet. I've probably put at least 30 hours into it. A lot of that time has been spent walking around, cooking, climbing mountains, trekking, horsing, finding roosters, setting enemy bases on fire . . . 

I have about 5 of the memories tracked down and two of the beasts.  I'm now trekking around up north/northwest.

1212624,"I think the 100 years thing got stuck in my head from Ocarina of Time. The Gerudo have a male born every 100 years and he becomes King of the Gerudo and that time, he winded up being Ganondorf. I probably just mentally made the leap to every Gerudo male being a dude who eventually becomes Ganondorf which would then require a Hero and a princess named Zelda to be born around that time as well to stave off the horrors. 

I like the ""born as needed"" claim far more. "
