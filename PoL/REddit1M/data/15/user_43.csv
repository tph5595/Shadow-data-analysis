31311,"i think its just something they thought of after the fact to make the game make more sense.

Even though it makes no sense. skull kid stays in the forest. majoras mask is a like an OOT remix, all the characters from OOT are in MM with a twist. how would skull kid have seen eveyone in the game if he just stays in the forest? i think it being an alternate dimension sort of thing works well enough. or...it doesn't even need explaining."
31942,yea aonuma didn't say anything along the lines of it being a dream. he said it was more like a parallel dimension. not explicitly but thats the nature of these things. i'm going to go with that.
32034,quite ridiculous. i'll just ignore that one..
32084,and now we have rito again...and they look nothing like the old ones. i think nintendo give less fucks about the timeline than most fans do to be honest.
32181,by the state of lon lon ranch about 100 years after OOT lol
32337,i didn't like any of the SS races for some reason. the robots were kind of annoying too. the dragons even looked weird
32805,its not explicitly stated whether its kokiri or normal kids. could be either i think
32939,"they are thinking they want to have a death mountain type place, they want to have a dragon. buuuuttttt they also want to have bird like evolved zoras so lets make it zoras domain k? "
33055,"totally man. OOT, MM, WW, TP, and SS are the only ones that really make sense. BOTW loosely makes sense as being far into the future but there are also things that don't line up at all."
53039,"the old rito had beaks and mouths. and the new zora have full sized fishes for heads with a humanoid body underneath it.

i don't see people complaining about the zoras though. 

and how about the koroks? their faces are leafs with holes in. that look like they could fall off at any minute. i'll take weird over generic any day as long as its still cool."
244834,"the old rito were the best looking ones too. the point was that a lot of zelda characters have weird design choices so theres no point nit picking about things that don't make sense. 

i think the zora, goron, gerudo and koroks look awesome in this game. rito stand out as looking not great. and children in general look quite odd in this game."
1202662,"congrats on missing the point, which was that zelda has quite a lot of weirdly designed characters."
1275289,so the zoras always looking like that isn't relevant. 
1292105,"and it wasn't a complaint at all. again, completely missing the point!"
1459696,"because the windwaker rito design was being criticised for being weird, go read the other posts."
1497727,are you trolling me? get lost.
1540741,read the old comments chump
1835244,"you are trolling, now bog off."
