10027,"Agreed, I think the Zelda thing was the main reason for this change.

The retcon also works as the defeat of Ganon in the Oracle games splits up the Triforce which is then reassembled in A Link Between Worlds. It could be aruged that works even with Link's Awakening in the middle but I feel it's smoother like this. Also as Twinrova's sacrifice resulted in a brainless Ganon, it makes sense that Yuga was able to manipulate Ganon's body so easily in ALBW. It's basically a direct sequel. "
11011,The kokiri thing I can buy as they could be orphans that the Deku Tree decided to protect. Also the Dragon Roost thing makes sense as the Zora became the Ruto in the Wind Waker. We don't know how both exist in BOTW. 
11118,"Dated, yes. Whether it's pointless is really up to how you prefer to interpret the Zelda games. "
22842,The zora also recount the tales of the sage Ruto and how she helped the hero defeat Ganon. Ruto never became a sage in the Child timeline. The game's dialogue doesn't help pinpoint what timeline it's in or it would've be agreed on by now. 
23120,"I don't personally own the book but from what I've read online, I very much enjoy the diagrams of how the overworld maps line up with one another. It's cool to see where Zelda 1 and 2 take place. Some of the random trivia and concept art is neat too. "
23228,It is one of the books yeah. I'm sure they'll release it so I can shelve it next to my Hyrule Historia and feel good about myself. 
23384,Well the Deku Tree knew Link was necessary to save Hyrule when Ganondorf began to move. It could fit with my theory if he chose to leave Link Hylian so he can grow strong and become a hero. This is all conjecture of course. 
23547,"Looking at Breath of the Wild, it's obvious fitting into a timeline is taking a back seat to creative gameplay and Easter eggs. I'm okay with that too. "
23629,"I don't, sorry. I would lurk around Zeldadungeon and other fan sites every now and then in case someone translates more of it. If you find anything, please share! "
23730,"Yup. Everything will fall into place when the next game merges all three timelines, creates six more, and divides them by twelve to create half a timeline. It's all part of Aonuma's wild ride. "
23917,"Someone else mentioned this but there's a scene in the oracle games where Zelda acts like she's never met Link before. Also, if I recall correctly, her character design was pretty different from ALttP Zelda. A lot of people pointed his out back when  the first timeline came out so I understand why it was moved around. "
24501,Some of the people in the comments deduced why some of those changes were made. It is a lot though and some of it (the Termina one) are questionable. 
27939,"Wherever it fits, my point is they focused on making the game first. "
