16982,"They specifically seem to mention the Hero of Twilight rather early on, so it's confirmed to follow that timeline. Still no explanation on how the Rito and Zora both exist or why several locations are *almost* named after WW characters (""Mekar"" Island and Mount Daphnes), but I don't think Nintendo ever really intended for there to be a universal timeline every game had to conform to until fans requested it.

For all we know currently this could be 10,000 years after *any* of the games, and it's apparently been long enough for the entire kingdom to forget the Triforce exists. Nabooru and Darunia technically aren't Sages either, yet they are both important enough to be namesakes for their races' Divine Beasts. We don't really have enough information, specifically about when ""10,000 years ago"" was, but I guess there's usually lots of assumption when trying to form these timelines. "
