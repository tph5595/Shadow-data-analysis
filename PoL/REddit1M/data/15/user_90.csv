1197241,"there isn't a new link every 100 years, set. link is reborn when he dies, or rather when he's needed the most. also, there are 4 godesses. din, nayru, and farore created the world, and the triforce, but hylia is the godess of time. hylia's blood also runs through the royal family, and is the source of zelda's power (when the triforce isn't)."
1197431,"BOTW takes place in the most distant future, that's all we know. but since it contains shit from the entire franchise, like rito, koroks, ganon, and references to both OOT timelines and TP, it's safe to say that the reason nintendo hasn't revealed it's timeline placement is because it takes place after a time when all timelines fused together somehow."
1197703,"but then, why does zelda refer to twilight princess, and why is ganon the antagonist, rather than ganondorf? also, there's another thing about ganon that also wouldn't make sense in this scenario."
1197813,"not just two beasts, all of them are named after important people to all races. vah ruta = ruto. vah medoh = medli."
1198116,"the zora always had those heads, except in the decline of hyrule timeline."
1198343,"no. ganon is the antagonist, rito and koroks exist, and one of the zora stone tablets tells about how ruto became a sage, and helped link defeat ganon. it can't be anything but a fused timeline."
1198451,"no, he went back to a point after ganondorf had split the triforce."
1198992,BOTW can't be anywhere but after some point when the timeline merges together somehow. nothing has been confirmed about it's placement.
1199057,that makes no sense.
1203761,and?
1211095,"no, that reference doesn't say anything it's placement."
1213154,"the line aonuma pointed at is the one impa said in the trailer. and no, it can't be in the child timeline, due to ganon, rito, koroks, and one of the zora stone tablets."
1279996,"it is when you bring it up as a complaint about the new game, as if it never was like that in the first place."
1280049,"you forgot ganon, and the zora stone tablet."
1360881,"i get it. what i don't get is why you mentioned it specifically about the new game, when it's been this way since OOT."
1461949,what does the rito have to do with this? we're talking about the zora...
1529649,"what? let's start over, because this seem to have lost it's direction.


you specifically pointed out that the new zora has full sized fishes for heads, which they've had since OOT, and i'm asking why you specifically mentioned it about the new game. this has nothing to do with the rito, or the series' strange designs. this is about you mentioning the BOTW zora specifically to make that strange design point, as if it never was like that in the first place."
1549353,"this is unrelated to the start of the thread. this is only about one thing, and i've allready explained numerous times what that thing is, and yet you act like i'm trolling. just answer my question allready."
1888985,i'm not trolling. you're acting like a retard.
