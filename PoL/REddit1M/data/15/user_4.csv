9220,"Page 2 is a pretty big sucker punch to anyone who 100%ed Majora's Mask and improved the lives of everyone in Termina:

Turns out Termina is Skull Kid's Koholint, created by the mask and based on Skull Kid's memories and imagination, and after he and Link left after realising that their friends will always be their friends even if they aren't there, the place ceases to exist like when LA Link woke up the Wind Fish

Literally none of it mattered outside of giving Skull Kid the universe's most esoteric therapy session.

Interestingly, it is the only other game where ballad of the wind fish is mentioned... I'm never going to trust a game where that song is mentioned again :/"
