66675,"I think you're right. Here's some more info. The Great Deku Tree in WW sent out Koroks each year to plant new trees to help unite Hyrule and presumably dry up the sea. It seems to me that they succeeded and Hyrule became dry once again many, many years later. Once the Hylians in New Hyrule learned of this, some or all of them left to repopulate the kingdom. The Triforce was apparently destroyed in WW, so this might explain why it isn't mentioned in BoTW. Further, to my knowledge (haven't beaten the game yet so don't spoil it if I'm wrong) Ganondorf the man is dead, but his soul and Malice lives on in BoTW. He has been killed in all timelines thus far, so this doesn't confirm anything, but the death seems to be more or less permanent in the Downfall Timeline and he was reincarnated in the Child Timeline. This leaves the Adult Timeline as the only option for a ""living"" and still active Ganon. 

Tl;dr: I agree, I think it's in the Adult Timeline because of the Great Deku Tree, lack of Triforce, and Ganondorf's presence. "
