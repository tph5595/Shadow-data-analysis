26925,"Call me desperate, but I defer to [this line of thinking](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/0d/8a/05/0d8a058a3196f94b57265277149a6d30.jpg) when dealing with dreams/alternate realities.

Just because it was all in someone's head, doesn't mean it isn't real, in a manner of speaking.  I have a feeling Link imposed a lot of his thoughts into Skull Kid's creation of Termina as well.  Obviously, the world contained people that Link knew and interacted with in Hyrule; these were people that Skull Kid never met and likely never knew existed.  So whether it's the Mask reading Link's brain and implanted the people into this world, or Link's subconscious is populating the dream with things that are familiar to him (Inception style) there is still something of substance happening.

I honestly think the game points to this being a dream quite a few times.  The beginning sequence is Link falling down a strange tree trunk, surrounded by symbols and darkness.  And even with the power of the Ocarina of Time, he is only able to travel through time within a small 3 Day window?  And that 3 Day window is conveniently during an apocalypse being caused by the moon.

I've always assumed that Termina wasn't a physical place, but that doesn't mean it wasn't ""real"" to you or me, or to Link.  Maybe I'm just talking non-sense, but I don't think the Skull Kid Dream theory breaks the feelings I have about this game at all.

EDIT:  I'll also add that there are references to Majora's Mask within Breath of the Wild, mostly in the vein of landmarks.  Darman Lake in Eldin, Lulu and Mikau Lakes near Zora's Domain.  So even if the whole thing was a dream, it was memorable enough for the Hero of Time to spread the story of his adventure and for the names of his companions to pass into legend and have landmarks named after them."
27371,"There are landmarks named after almost every major character in the Zelda franchise, from Twilight Princess to Wind Waker to Majora's Mask.  The Divine Beasts are all named after sages; three from Ocarina of Time and one from Wind Waker.

Vah Rutah: Ruto (Zora Water Sage)
Vah Naboris: Nabooru Gerudo Spirit Sage)
Vah Radunia: Darunia (Goron Fire Sage)
Vah Medo: Medley (Rito Earth Sage)

Also the clothes of Twilight, Wind, the Hero, and Time all exist from the amiibo, and the descriptions seem apt to fit all of the aforementioned past incarnations.  So it does seem the timelines were fused at some point, or at the very least, became aware of each other's legends.

&gt;Still no explanation on how the Rito and Zora both exist

I always thought that the Rito were descendants/evolutions of the Zora.  Both can exist simultaneously.  "
27432,The Kikwi can stay unmemorable for all I care; I never cared for their design.  The Mogma were awesome though.  Mole people that talked like 20's mobsters?  Sign me up.
