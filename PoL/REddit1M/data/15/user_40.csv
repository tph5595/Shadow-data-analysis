&gt; 
&gt; In [the Downfall Timeline], Zoras went berserk and changed into different color as Hyrule declined, gradually losing contact with Hylians and becoming ""River Zoras"".    

If this is the case then I feel like it solidly places BoTW thousands of years after the events of Twilight Princess as the Zora within it aren't cave-dwelling mer-people."
