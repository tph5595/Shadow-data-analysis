57906,I still cry in the dark sometimes because Kyle Katarn is not real anymore. Neither the X-Wing series...

1303245,I agree. The downfall of the Skywalker bloodline starts with that thing. Only Cade Skywalker many years later could restore something from that.

Looking in a matter of how they managed to diminish Skywalker's bloodline from both Luke and Leia sides and comparing how Cade was well built until left unfinished. Hence the ""could restore"". This part of the EU I'm glad is gone, it was a mess and should be better planned."
