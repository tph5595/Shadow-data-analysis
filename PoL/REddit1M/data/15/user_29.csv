And there are names specific to every single Zelda game except Spirit Tracks (unless you want to count Linebeck for both ST and Phantom Hourglass), Fours Swords, Four Swords Adventure, and Triforce Heroes"

Also I thought the Koroks were sent out to repopulate the islands with trees, plants can't really dry an ocean"

70376,"Well they could stop erosion from happening and slowly reconnect islands, but it's not like they could create mountains or remove the massive ocean, it could only really displace it, not to metion the formation of the geography of breath of the wild would take more than 10000 years"
