Honestly though in terms of the timeline/overarching lore I really think they lost sight at some point. I never enjoyed the whole 'hero's downfall' timeline concept."

29281,"&gt;but I don't think Nintendo ever really intended for there to be a universal timeline every game had to conform to until fans requested it.

I don't think -every- game had to be included, but it's pretty explicit that some of the games are 'tied together' in some way, so it irritates me when they forget or gloss over things and have inconsistencies, like having the Koroks in a non-flooded world because reasons. "
29841,"Man, while I liked the idea of a timeline I really kind of felt like the only 'timeline' should involve mainline games sort of in the 'OoT'verse as I like to call it, since they tend to have at least some connection. 

So the 'adult and child' timelines are fine with me, the problem for me is with the 'downfall' timeline, it feels like they just slopped all of the NES and GB games in there just to give them a place. The timeline should have ever only been sequels and prequels to Ocarina of Time."
69263,"True, but that's the reason given in game at least for the Koroks 'when they came to live on the sea they took on these forms'.

Of course I'm just biased because I'm not a huge fan of Koroks replacing Kokiri. I'm alright with them as their own race, but I'm irritated with them having never used the Kokiri in original form since Ocarina of Time."
