65177,The idea of a timeline at all always annoyed me.  I grew up just figuring that they were just retellings of a similar story kinda how stories are passed from generation to generation.
1462177,"Go back to Ocarina of Time (before the timeline was originally released to the world) and none of the games have any relation to one another. The whole thing seems like it was kludged together after the fact.
What would it make no sense that none of the games are directly related to each other except for some common themes and story elements?"
