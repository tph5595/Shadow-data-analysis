In OoT, an adult Link meets Guru-Guru in the Kakariko Windmill and learns the Song of Storms. Guru-Guru mentions that he learned that song 7 years ago from a green-clothed kid. Link then travels back in time and teaches Guru-Guru that song.

Link then proceeds to defeat Ganon and return to his life as a child, at the exact moment when he met Zelda the first time, meaning he never actually went to the future, or back to the ""present"" yet somehow retains his memory of that great adventure. He leaves Hyrule in search of his lost fairy companion who doesn't remember saving the world with him. He stumbles into Termina, a neighboring land, wherein he discovers the tomb of composer brothers Sharp and Flat, who wrote the Song of Storms, and Flat teaches it to Link for the first time ever. 

So this must mean that somehow Link's memories of songs, perhaps through the magic of the Ocarina of Time, can transcend realities, and bleed into the alternate timelines, allowing him to ""teach"" the song to, and ""learn"" it from Guru-Guru, despite it actually having been composed in another timeline in another land after the point in time Link ""teaches"" it to Guru-Guru, but before he ""learns"" it from him.

That, apparently, is how time works in Zelda."
