49768,"Honestly, this is just my wild fan theory (I'm not really going off of anything here), but what if those ""sage men"" are the actual physical spirits of the sages, similar to the spirit of the Hero, or the goddess, which allow them to reincarnate throughout the ages. Maybe there is a kind of Avatar TLA thing going on where if they are killed in human form, they are able to reincarnate in another body, but if they are killed in their spirit form then they are dead forever. Maybe because they needed to seal Ganon immediately, they took the risk to appear in spirit form, rather than awakening in human form. This would explain why in TP the water sage is still dead. "
