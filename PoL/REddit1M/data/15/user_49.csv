42576,"Shame BotW isn't on there. It's apparently supposed to be at the end of the child timeline, but there's just too many contradictions and inconsistencies to actually place it there. It's some sort of mish mash of the adult and child timelines, with ancient technology thrown in."
1209952,"The game basically says that it comes after Twilight Princess in one of the cutscenes. Canonically it's supposed to be there, but there's loads of contradictions."
1212512,"It doesn't say it outright, but it only makes mention of Skyward Sword, Ocarina of Time, and Twilight Princess. Aonuma also hinted that the game references its timeline placement somewhere.

It's not entirely conclusive I suppose, but very strongly indicates toward the Child Timeline placement."
1213634,"Koroks aren't exclusive to the adult timeline, and Rito supposedly evolved from Zora, yet there are also Zora. There are many, many contradictions, but the child timeline seems to still be the official placement despite them. The Zelda series generally prioritizes telling the current story how they like rather than keeping everything consistent."
