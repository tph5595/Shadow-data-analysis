14615,"It just doesn't seem right at all.
Clearly the mask is powerful if it created Skull Kid's own Koholint, and so that means that even giving him his ""therapy session"" you haven't actually dealt with the mask at all.

Plus, what the hell sort of memories would a skull kid have that created places like Ikana canyon- and how the hell would people the skull kid would never have met be recreated in his own dream? Also, the memory scene with Tatl, Tael and Skull Kid in the log- are we meant to assume that happened somewhere in Hyrule- if that is the case what the hell are the made up Tatl and Tael doing there? At the end, when Link's walking through the lost woods again- shouldn't his shield have disappeared? What about the BOTW item description for the Fierce Deity items?

Honestly, it simply being a parallel world makes 100 times more sense than this, and is just far better otherwise. It doesn't essentially further degrade the chronicle of the Hero Of Time, who we already know lived out the rest of his life unrecognised and with regret, by making it so he didn't even have all the adventures we thought he did- in actuality there was only one.

Plus, it essentially removes all the interesting depth that Termina brought (even if it was purely superficial when people speculated things) by making it so that everything in it (like the Fierce Deity mask- whose appearance in BOTW I truly hoped would have some attached story) not exist.

This feels less like an actual lore reveal- and more like somebody deciding to put down their own personal opinion on it. What I certainly don't understand is why they go on to describe more about Termina's lore when they completely removed any relevance and significance from it within a single sentence- and in actuality it only existed for 3 days. It also completely removes any of the cool mystery surrounding the Happy Mask Salesman as well. I know it's just a game, but it's my favourite Zelda game and I am really quite annoyed.

EDIT: I just looked this up, and Aonuma even outright stated Majora's Mask wasn't a dream a few years ago:http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/02/21/zelda-eiji-aonuma-interview.aspx"
