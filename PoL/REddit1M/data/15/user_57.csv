47465,"About Termina, I think I understand what is meant here. A Stalchild steals the mask from the salesman, becomes Skull Kid, and through it's wicked power creates an entirely new world based on his memories/feelings. This doesn't mean that Skull Kid populated the world with denizens though, as we only see glimpses of him being incredibly alone and bitter. Termina could have been entirely empty save for the Giants that were friendly to him and Tatl and Tael who he met before the mask. Given the end of the game where he asks Link to ""play good guys and bad guys"" with him, it's entirely possible that while he was in search of someone to play the opposite role in his wicked ""game"" he saw a perfect candidate in Link who was wandering alone and lost. He drags Link in to this amorphous and dreamlike world and suddenly it isn't lonely anymore, suddenly it's populated by dozens of dream world variants from Links own mind to exact revenge upon, dozens of ""people"" Link now has to save as part of the ""good guy bad guy game"" the mask is purveying. It's far too specific an adventure for the turmoil Link is feeling to be just based off of the Skull Kids mind alone. This is a personal adventure. It's is incredibly similar to how the Windfish creates a Koholint, and it just so happens to be completely tailor made for Link to explore and come into his own as a hero. The Nightmare takes the form of Ganon for a reason after all, and the Wind Fish certainly never would have met him.

Long story short, the mask made an empty world that was populated by Link once Skull Kid found someone to play ""good guys and bad guys"" with. Link goes on a personal journey because everyones a Wizard of Oz style expy of everyone he ever knew. At the end the two find a new friend and grow as people."
