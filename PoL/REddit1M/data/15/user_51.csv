45347,"To be honest, I don't think Nintendo has made the games with the timeline in mind, except for fringe cases like Twilight Princess.

Given the circular nature of the stories (that is, a great evil is resurrected, a hero rises to stop him and then it keeps going on like that forever) games like Breath of the Wild can pretty much be self-sufficient, inserting themselves anywhere in the timeline and just saying ""this is after Twilight Princess""."
