9489,"the kokiri used to be hylians????? so i assume hylian children wandered into the forest, turned into immortal kokiri, and then eventually became full on tree babies"
10042,"wow a lot of stuff makes no sense, dragon roost island was zoras domain and not death mountain??"
13824,but but it would have been easy to say that the zora swam to death mountain where valoo turned them into birds
13878,i assume some zora left the domain and became birds. idk nintendos screwing with us at this point.
19431,"wouldnt have made sense, the kikiwi are a different race entirely and its probably a coincidence, i was kind of expecting them and mogmas to show up but i guess not. now they will be stuck in the pit of unmemorableness  "
69946,yea but they could have put that there themselves
70213,"actually not true, because theres already a race of sentient fish men, called the fish men. they could find hyrule by that logic but werent turned into anything."
70373,"but they did talk about timeline tuff before hyrule historia. with wind waker they said that it takes place after one of ocarina of times endings, and with TP they said it takes place after the other one.

scroll down to the individual games."

204369,"well to answer, it had nothing to do with the reincarnation, and hylia has been relevant since skyward sword. dont know why shes still worshiped or how she gives you hearts when she should be in a mortal body."
204497,ah you should also add that nabooru was also mentioned as the namesake for naboris. she was nothing more than a common gerudo in the child timeline and it was only in the adult and downfall timelines that she was an important gerudo figure. 
204672,"my guess is they are fully evolved in botw. it took the rito from wind waker 100 years to evolve, and botw is thousands of years after whichever ending of ocarina of time so its not impossible for them to become full on birds. and no ones complaining about the new zoras because the new zora are the best looking ones yet."
