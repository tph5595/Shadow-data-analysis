25552,"I disagree, as a day 1 Zelda player, I hate what they did to Ganons lore. I prefer Gannondorf and I always will. I hate this calamity crap. The rest is fine.My favorite lineage story is the LTTP beginning and ending. That's the real Zelda story to me. That's just me though, we can all like different things."
