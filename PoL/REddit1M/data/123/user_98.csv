To this day, SS is the only 3D Zelda I haven't beat because I got through like 85-90% and I had to do some serious backtracking. Probably almost got to the 3rd pudgey toe guy fight but I just couldn't do it any more. 

  The best example of SS is the pirate ship dungeon. Using the time thing to make sand revert to water was one of my favorite Zelda memories, and they cap it all off with the lamest looking boss in the series. "
