36708,"Skyward Sword definitely had its share of flaws (the hand-holding and wonky controls like everyone says) but the actual puzzles, environment, enemy variety, and story itself was gorgeous.

I completely agree with you that the Zelda team looked at all the criticisms that SS got and completely turned it around. I really like /u/thechristoph 's comment on how SS doesn't trust you to play it, while BoTW just lets you have everything. I found SS still fun and memorable and it should be remembered more than just sometimes wonky motion controls."
