85872,"Everyone complains about the motion controls in skyward sword but I also liked them. It does take some practice to get a feel for how forceful you have to be to execute a particular action, but it became pretty second nature once I was used to it. You couldn't just flail out with the sword though, you had to be measured in how you would get yourself in position, then strike.

There was linearity and there wasn't a whole lot of diversity in enemies, but I felt that the design of the areas made up for it. Yes, you had to backtrack and revisit places, but you were always doing something new, so you'd see a different aspect of each place that you hadn't seen before.

The games I don't like in terms of the controls are the DS touchscreen Zeldas. Spirit Tracks is saved a bit by having Zelda tag along, but there were so many times that I'd try to sword at something and end up rolling into it or some other stylus control scheme accident. It was such a relief that Link Between Worlds dropped that and went back to the more intuitive control scheme from the earlier overhead gameboy games."
