64363,"The combat is a mixed bag to me

* On one side, it's novel. It forced me to actually think more about what to do. Sometimes I literally was stuck figuring out how the hell would I beat that enemy. Like the first Skulltula I found. I spent way too long trying to hit it and only see it balancing around lol. Bosses were fun as well!
* On the other hand... Combat was way too easy overall. So many enemies basically being like ""HEY LOOK I'M NOT MOVING FOR TEN SECONDS SHOWING YOU THE OBVIOUS WEAK POINT WHICH WILL REQUIRE YOU TO HIT WITH A DIAGONAL STRIKE!!!"", it eventually just became a ""my first motion gaming"" kind of thing and was boring overall. They did great in BotW now: the combat is hard and fast paced rather than very slow paced to give you enough time to do the right move

I think it was perfectible, but overall rather enjoyable!"
64706,"My take on TP: I was very hype when it came out, and overall enjoyed the game, but it just felt... lackluster? Nothing stood out to me. It was just ""a Zelda game"". I actually don't really remember any standout moment in the game. The only two things I clearly remember are the memorable boss where you have to ride the screw-thing along the wall to reach him, and the dungeon which was actually some yeti house which I found interesting. I don't remember any moment where I was actually challenged in the entire game, except the puzzle to get the sword.

I think I dismissed it as not challenging enough/too classic. I've replayed it with the Wii U remake and felt the same: it's a good game overall, but nothing really stands out, it just progresses in a classic Zelda way. I think it was the last straw in the classic Zelda formula. And the reason way I liked SS more is because it was trying to challenge that formula. Not in the best ways, but I appreciated the changes, the interesting world, the different story etc. And BotW now goes much deeper in that formula change, to our greatest satisfaction!"

Interestingly that was one of my favorite thing about SS. These little challenges were fun and also quite stressful!"
