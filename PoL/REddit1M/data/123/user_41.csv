19660,"I feel like I'm the only one in the entire universe who doesn't think Skyward's story is good. It's literally just a shipper's fanfic with dramatic cinematics.

Frankly, I don't care about Link and Zelda's relationship. And even if I did, it's not even *good* romance. It was just full-blown overused-anime-trope filler. 

Majora's Mask and Link's Awakening are examples of story done right imo, and interestingly they have nothing to do with Princess Zelda. "

Don't know why you're being downvoted, this is one of the most sane comments in this entire thread. 

I swear if Skyward Sword wasn't a Zelda game nobody would be praising the story. "
20894,"Definitely. Although I don't like the *main* story of BotW (I don't care about Link and Zelda's relationship), this game had more worldbuilding than Skyward, TP, and WW put together. We haven't seen something like this since Majora's Mask. "
