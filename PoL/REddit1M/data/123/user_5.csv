Skyward Sword was awful because the play side of it sucked, it didn't respect me, and Nintendo just flat out doesn't have the writing chops to sell a game on narrative merit alone. The story of Skyward Sword might've been ""better"" than other Zelda games (I take serious issue with that, but it's a different argument), but it's still schlocky anime trash in the broader cultural context.

Hell, it even fails as an origin story. Literally all the cool shit happened well in the past. The sword is already there. The people are inexplicably floating in the sky. The big bad is already sealed away. Everything truly formative is still some legendary, ""oh, the goddess did it waaaaay back"" hand waving bullshit

I played it all the way through, and you know what part of Skyward Sword really sticks out in my memory? How every ostensibly Big And Important NPC is going on and on about how I'm this great hero and I have this momentous destiny, and I have to go through a trial that will prove my mettle... by swimming around to collect musical tadpoles. 

Yeah, what a harrowing crucible that was.

Fuck that game. I remember playing it and feeling little more than a sinking feeling that Nintendo had completely lost touch with what made these games so compelling back when they were landmark events. Thank god they had the good sense to realize they'd shit the bed so badly that they had to get a new mattress. "

The *first thing* they do is make you hang right, and there's a chest there with the map. So you look at it. The room geometry is simple enough to understand its general shape. You see the sliding block interface. It's *very clear* that the pieces correspond to the rooms because of the visual language of the only square you can move is so similar to the maps you've been looking at all game, so you're gonna have a basic clue either by familiarity with the game's innate ruleset (this is a late game dungeon), or the simple intuition you develop from existing as a human being long enough to learn how to tie your shoes.

So you move a piece, the room shifts, there's this *massive fucking rumble* as Link's animations are all ""whooaaaaa, holy shit, things are happening!"", and then what?

Fucking Fi pops out to tell me, ""Hey, I think something might've happend!""

No fucking shit, Fi. Thanks.

That *really helped*."

10139,"Well it's definitely not the beginning of either the sword or the etc. so it seems that calling it an ""origin story"" is a bit of a stretch. 

But it sure did explain why there's a red bird thing on the shield, which is definitely the Zelda mystery that'd been haunting me forever. "
11982,"I'm honestly surprised to hear someone say this. You didn't create it: you wiggled it around in a couple fires.

It's an ancient sword that immediately starts projecting a sentient hologram. Popping out the cross guard is *very little* in the ""where the fuck did this thing come from"" department.

Which, honestly, is fine. It's not like an explanation is going to be all that interesting. But there just flat out isn't one more nuanced than ""the goddess did it""."

96049,"I genuinely believe both Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword were reactionary games. 

Nintendo sees everyone (read: loud fans) freaking out about Wind Waker's aesthetic and break from traditional world structure, so they remake Ocarina with Twilight Princess. 

Then Nintendo sees that those loud fans are disappointed by most of Twilight Princess, but they really like Midna and all this timeline shit, so they make a game focusing more on characters and world building. But these aren't Nintendo's strengths, so we get the disaster that is Skyward Sword. 

I could very well be way off, but if I'm not: here's hoping they stick to focusing on the lessons learned from BotW rather than listening to fan outcry from here on out. "
