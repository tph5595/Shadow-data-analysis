64189,"Speaking of those first couple of hours...  After beating the game, I decided to give the Hero Mode a shot.  One of the instructors says something like, ""I see you've selected Hero Mode. Still, it doesn't hurt to cover the basics.""  

I had to beat the game to unlock the hero mode. The game knows this. The game acknowledges I know how to play. It still tries to teach me how to play.

I was so annoyed by that that I just turned the game off. Haven't been back to it since."
