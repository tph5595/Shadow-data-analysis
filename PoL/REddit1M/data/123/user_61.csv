29584,"The first time I played Skyward Sword I didn't know how I felt about it.  It was an odd feeling but I just remember not feeling anything and I had no desire to 100% the game either.  I thought, why don't I revisit this game in a few years when it's not so fresh on my mind?  So, I waited for a few years until I just really wanted to play it again.  I remember one of the problems I ran into was being to used to old shield mechanics and that approaching certain enemies could be sometimes quite different.  I opted not to use a shield and really take the time to get a good handle on the controls.  And you know what?  I wound up really loving the game my second time around.  I even did Hero Mode right afterword which I thought was the best Hero Mode we've gotten so far.  I played though it and much of the Zelda series again recently and I wondered if my opinion would stand.  It did.  I understand that it's not for everyone and that's fine but I feel like it gets looked at way harsher than any other Zelda game.  Sure the game takes a little while to get started but have you played Twilight Princess recently?  Yes, it's quite a linear game but have you ever played Minish Cap?  Sure, Fi's probably a bit more hand holdy than any other partner character but when there are people out there who couldn't figure out where to go at times Ocarina, Majora's Mask, Wind Waker and Twilight Princess can you really blame them for really trying to drive home what you're supposed to be doing?  It's not a perfect game and it obviously has its faults but if you really looked critically at another Zelda title you'd probably be able to find fault with it as well."

I have some really strong feelings about TriForce Heroes right now though.  Managed to get two other people to commit to completing it 100% so I'll try to judge it on that experience and see how things go."

The single player in TriForce Heroes though, that feels absolutely unplayable.  The little multiplayer I played I got the impression that you get a serious team together and coordinate like a well-oiled machine.  For the longest time I only had one other friend interested but now we've got a Trio so we're ready to tackle it."
