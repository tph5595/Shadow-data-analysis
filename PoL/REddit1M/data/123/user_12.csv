4757,You think BOTW has a better story than skyward sword?
6457,Maybe if more than two of the four had a story I would agree.. as it is there's literally zero tension. There's no meaningful interaction with the key story components. It's more like a short film.

8735,"Not taking that away, just wondering why you qualified it with the limitations honestly. "
8807,Skyloft dungeon had all the hallmarks of a final Zelda dungeon..

21326,Yeah none of the people I know who play Zelda watch anime (small sample size) so none of this affected us. Interesting idea. 
21759,Yeah it's incredible how much they carried over. I much prefer SS though..
