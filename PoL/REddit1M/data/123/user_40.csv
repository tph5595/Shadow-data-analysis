19611,"I enjoyed the game when I played it on release, but with hindsight it's not as memorable as say, Majora's Mask or OOT. I do remember on release Nintendo talking about removing the focus on dungeons and giving the player more freedom, which in truth was only realised with BoTW because Skyward Sword is quite traditional and linear. Nevertheless, it was probably an important stepping stone for Nintendo as you say, and it's certainly not an ""awful"" game as some people have commented."
