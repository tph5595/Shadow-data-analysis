36660,"I agree with pretty much everything you said. There's not even any real reason to compare Ganondorf/Ganon/Demise with Girahim in the first place, because they never even fill the same role in the story and aren't mutually exclusive. Girahim is closer to Zant or maybe even Twinrova.

I'd say that Zant, for all his flaws and missed potential, was a significantly better villain than Girahim ever was, despite being similar characters(intended to be creepy, plus arrogance -&gt; hissy fit). Probably because with Zant it was never about simple arrogance, it was resentment and delusions of grandeur. His introduction was also waaaay better than Girahim. Opening cutscene? He's *incredibly* threatening. First time you meet him? *He fucks you up.* Every time I remember Girahim shows up he did...practically nothing. He's just there to be in the way then beaten. After he just kinda loses to Link the first time he shows up he lost all sense of perceived threat in terms of the story; we beat him once, we'll beat him again.

And of course I'm not even bringing up Girahim's generic appearance, because at this point there's no need to aside from to acknowledge it. Everything about that's already been said. "

Granted, Wind Waker got close, but I stopped that second playthrough at the triforce shards because it was tedious and I'd already read pretty much all the Hylian text."
