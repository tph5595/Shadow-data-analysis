80852,"I'm gonna say I was a hipster and disliked SS *before* it was cool.  I got it for my 10th bday or something and I played it nonstop for like five days and beat it all the way through.  I was disappointed with how much they re-used areas, the mostly boring weapons and dungeons, and the lack of exciting characters (with the exception of the vampire guy or whatever, he was cool).

It wasn't a bad game but it was very low on the Zelda tier list for me.  I might change my mind if I were to play it again but probably not after how incredible BOTW is."
