2513,"FITE ME.

It's cartoonish. The cut scenes are excrutiatingly long and non-skippable. I found the characters to be cheesy and generic. It takes hours before you're actually able to play the game. Lanayru's a cool area, but I spent way too much time drowning in the quicksand. 

Fi can go jump off a cliff.

I get that many people like SS but they'll never convince me that it's a good game. Don't take the dislike of it so seriously...many people dislike Twilight Princess, which is one of my favorites, but...who cares?"

Shut up, Fi. There's a ONE HUNDRED FUCKING PERCENT CHANCE THAT IT'S THAT WAY."

I appreciate it for the little things: the sounds those black flying Twilight things make and the overall creepy factor of the Twilight realm and its monsters as a whole; getting the Master Sword for the first time and that moment when you step into the Temple of Time in the past for the first time; Midna and the dynamic between her and Link. I just found it...fun, and fun in a way that I'd never found a Zelda game before, even if the other games are ostensibly better games. 

This was all pre BotW for me though; in terms of fun and challenging, this blows it out of the water. I'll still turn back to TP eventually though."
76578,"Yeah, TP took me a few tries to fully get into, but by the time I hit the Goron Mines I was having a blast....I can't really think of a time in SS where I thought ""hey, this is a REALLY great game!"". It's fine, sure, but I have zero desire to replay."
