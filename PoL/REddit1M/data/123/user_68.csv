34307,I fucking love that game! Replayed it last January while writing my thesis and it alone got me through. I decided to write an entirely new thesis three weeks before deadline and decided an hour of thesis work allowed me 40 minutes of SS. Swapped back and forth the entire time.  Got a 1.1. thanks Skyward Sword! P.s. i hate Link's eyebrows in this game.
34668,"I loved the motion controls! I get into stupid childish arguments on the internet with people who disagree with me. So many comments about how shit the motion controls were and i end up calling people fat lazy nerds... I'm not proud of it. But Christ! I loved the way that you only improved in Sword fighting through actually learning the movements: It wasn't some cheap spam button bullshit, but you're ability to swing your arm! "
34716,I really wish Gratitude Crystals were implemented in Breath of the Wild... I feel the game needed something like that...
35193,"Twilight Princess, though i loved it the first time, is the only Zelda I've never been able to replay. People talk about SS having a long tutorial... Mother of Christ, the monkey, the bees, the horse, the goats(escaping and herding), the cat, (wrestling?) Those ugly fucking kids. Mother of Christ! SS is just, Carry that barrel, free your bird, win a race, get sword?"
35239,"I liked the combat, too! Thank Christ some people fucking did, all i ever see is people bitching!"
35395,Fucking hell! So an 8 it of 10 so?
35681,"Very well said! I've always felt that people hating the motion controls didn't give it a proper chance, it's cool to know that was the case with you!"
97437,"I've actaully started TP about seven more times... my last attempt got me past the first dungeon, but I ended up putting it down and never continuing... Some day, maybe!"
97491,I never got to experience any of the multiplayer ones... Hoe its enjoyable for you!
260413,"Yeah, i know it's bad to say, i mostly based it on my friends and family saying it was too much effort and they didn't want to move their arms. I understand that some people might have difficulties if their mobility is limited, but freom my low sampling group it was just laziness. The angling could be tricky to pull off, but it stopped bothering me after a while. maybe you were too close or weren't calibrating it properly? My issue really is only with people who didn't give it more than a two minute chance..."
