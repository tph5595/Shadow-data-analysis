9710,"This is a bad post, every part of it is wrong imo. Skyward Sword is like a polished turd, it looks shiny and beautiful but it's still shit. 
This was a bad game, and do you know why? Because playing it was a chore. The characters were flat and boring, the quests were all tedious and mind numbing, and the bosses were highly overused and frustrating. The controls were hard to handle and absolutely frustrating at certain points, but i'll be generous and chalk that up to me hating motion controls. Except that i'm perfectly fine with them in games where nintendo bothered to make them good. 
Know what else? I didn't even finish the game because i had no desire to. The reward of finishing this god awful game was not worth the torture of having to play it. 
So don't you dare compare BoTW to Skyward Shit, because the two could not possibly be more different. BoTW is everything a Zelda game should be, and this ugly piece of shit is a Zelda game with all the fun parts taken out. "
