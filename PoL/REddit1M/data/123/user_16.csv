5656,"For real? I distinctly remember Fi interrupting me for a 20-second dialogue sequence multiple times, usually to tell me how to solve a puzzle before I even had the chance to think about it. Plus the way she would bug you when you were low on health was inexcusable."
5790,"I'll come out and say that I prefer the BOTW story to SS. Sure it's simpler, but the charm of each main mission and the fact that I discovered them at my own pace elevated it for me. Plus the presentation is more along the lines of a classic anime, which I loved. I always saw SS's story as an average Zelda story with a few predictable twists. I remember it feeling very dumbed down, especially after Twilight Princess."
5917,"Fi is probably my biggest disappointment in a Zelda game. We had just come off of Midna, and Fi's design was so slick. I was hyped for a fun new companion."
7641,"Oh yeah, the fucking batteries too. I can figure out batteries, Fi!"
7974,"I do wish there was more substance to the Goron and Rito sections. The Zora and Gerudo were amazing.

As for interaction between story components, I think it's perfectly acceptable given the non-linearity of it. And I disagree about the tension. There is certainly always tension with Ganon being a persistent presence in Hyrule Castle, causing the Divine Beasts and Guardians to terrorize everyone in the world. But there can't be too much tension, or it won't make any sense for Link to fuck around in the world, which is what the game is designed for. They avoided a Fallout 4 scenario with this method."
8538,"All I'm saying is that I enjoyed it, especially in comparison to SS. I found SS's story derivative, unenjoyable, and childish. So, I can only see BOTW as an improvement."
9021,"I don't think I really qualified it. Sure, certain things could have done better. That is almost always the case. But on the whole, I found that the nonlinear nature of it, combined with the fact that the certain implications of the story are told purely through gameplay (the wandering Guardians and the ruins scattered across the landscape) made it more enjoyable for me. I'm a ""less is more"" type of person."
88681,"You may not remember handholding because you don't seem to understand what handholding is. Having a character interrupt the game to tell you that your health is low is the purest form of handholding. It is one of countless examples of Skyward Sword grabbing your hand and explaining something to the player, when there is absolutely no reason that the player cannot figure it out for themselves."
