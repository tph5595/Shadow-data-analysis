3056,"I apologize for not having the time to address your arguments thoroughly, but allow me to offer the following points of rebuttal:

* Zelda games have always been about Link's journey and the acquisition of power, courage, and wisdom are central to Link's actualization as the ""Hero of Legend"" in every game. Skyward Sword is not unique in that regard, despite it being an origin story. 

* Fi is a miserable companion, especially compared to Midna, but she lacks the personality of even the faeries of the N64 games.

* The Wii's motion controls are all but guaranteed to age poorly. Unless a remake is made which gets rid of them or adapts them to modern technology, the game will probably regarded as a misfit in the larger context of the series' console-entries.

* Nothing about the game stands out in my mind so much as the awful, repetitive fights in which Link has to seal Demise and the fact that the game simply doesn't have a final dungeon, both of which are huge marks against it.
