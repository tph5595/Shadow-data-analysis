12876,"I don't *hate* Skyward Sword overall, but it definitely had some things that greatly irritated me: I hated having to do so much backtracking, particularly that shit where you had to collect the glowing peas to fill up the pod for every damn area; I hated fighting the same bosses/minibosses over and over (the giant monster thing and Ghirahim); I hated how spaced out the skylands were and flying that stupid bird around; and I really struggled with the motion controls at times--plus they made every fight take 10x longer than it should.

Things I did like: I didn't mind the story, the graphics were good (though the ""painting"" filter on the landscapes looks really muddy and ugly nowadays), sprinting and climbing were welcome additions to the franchise, and the motion controls were fun for a little while.

Overall, I'd give it a 3/5. Definitely one of the lesser Zelda games, but it certainly had its merits."

Yesssss, the bird was slow, and the islands felt so damn far apart--with virtually nothing in between them. Plus, when I first picked up the game, I could not get the flying motion controls to cooperate *at all*--it was seriously one of the most frustrating gaming experiences I've ever had.

&gt; To this day, SS is the only 3D Zelda I haven't beat...

It actually took me 3 separate tries (starting over from the beginning each time) over the course of about 2-3 years before I finally beat it myself--so I know just where you're coming from.

&gt; they cap it all off with the lamest looking boss in the series

Which one was that--the one with the 6 arms? It's been a while."
