32953,"This is **the** worst thing about Fi. The game was actually really cleverly built, there's so many architectural clues and some of the best level design in the series all working together to teach players through play and interaction/exploration. Things like the island debris you mentioned are made memorable and placed in a way that players are naturally going to discover them on their own. I loved the dungeon with explosive burrs that get attached to the sword, and they placed those burrs in ways that players would naturally discover their function and rules before coming to puzzles that require them to use that knowledge. But Fi tells you how and what to do as soon as A) you see the burrs, and B) whenever you come to a puzzle that uses them.

Fi subverts and interrupts every piece of good level and play design in SS. I honestly think her interruptions were added late in development as it just doesn't fit in with what the rest of the game was trying to achieve. What makes this even more obvious to me is that there's an actual hint system in the game, through the sheikah stone ala the OoT and MM 3DS remakes, but Fi gives you a constant invasive tutorial on every puzzle and leaves nothing up to the player to discover or play around with.

SS would still have some issues without Fi, but honestly it would have been one of my favourite Zelda games without her."

There's still some fundamental issues with the game RE level variety and forced linearity, but I would enjoy it so much.

Alternatively a new Zelda that combined the best elements of SS and BotW is something I would be super keen on. A game with BotW's open world and lack of hand holding with SS's items and level/dungeon design would be incredible."
138215,I reckon they just got some questionable feedback in playtesting and went totally and wildly overboard trying to solve it. Or Miyamoto popped in and went about being Miyamoto :P
