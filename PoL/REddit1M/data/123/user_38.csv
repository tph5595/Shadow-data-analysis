18796,"Skyward sword wasn't an adventure. It was a  disney show.   Handholding, stamin-UGH, forced dialogue and tutorials, a ""mystic prophecy"" that a hero will slay the villain removing all threat and tension, the only redeemable parts were zelda's adorableness, ancient cistern, ghirahim, groose,and the music."
