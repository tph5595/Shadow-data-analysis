36411,"As far as I remember... I agree with peoples overall complaints about Fi. I don't hate her like most do, but she really was Captain Obvious in a bad way. And they tied her to the Master Sword. 

Any other sidekick people don't like can just fade away, but Fi can't fade away without getting rid of the Master Sword itself. Combine that with her being more annoying than Navi herself, and I think that's a valid reason to dislike what SS did to the lore. 

That said, I like Skyward Sword despite Fi being the one sidekick I'd actually classify as annoying, and accept the lore that ties her to the sword. Also Loftwings were awesome and I spent half my time flying because I could."
