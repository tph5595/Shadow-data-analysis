53588,"Skyward is my favourite. 

I played OoT aged 10 or something, and what I liked about Skyward is that it felt a long and winding *story*. An *adventure*. Like OoT; and that's hard to do aged 25 or whatever. It's partly why I was a bit disappointed in Breath, because the story is, what, a quarter of Skywards length? I appreciate the decisions they took with BotW, and it's all done with the same detail and care. I absolutely agree you can see how they responded to SS criticism going forward. It just hasn't really struck my chords. 

I've played the vast majority of all Zelda games and I'd say Skyward struck me the most after OoT.
