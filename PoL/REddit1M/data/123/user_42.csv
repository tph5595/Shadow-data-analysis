19825,"For me, it was the giant pinwheel thing in the sky.

Walking around Eldin, I saw a weird rainbow pinwheel in the ground. What could it be? I can't interact with it. Why is it here? I spent a good 20 minutes trying everything I could with it, before commiting it to memory. ""I'll come back to it later.""

Then some time later I find a large rainbow pinwheel thing in the sky. There's a dude on it who says a piece of his island fell down to the ground below. I know what he's talking about! I seen it! I'm going to help this man and bring him joy!

Then Fi popped out, said ""No. *I* know where it is."" And zoomed in on the exact point in Eldin where it was, showing me a picture of it, I think even putting in a waypoint. She took that moment from me, where I felt like I had a real quest and that my own curiosity would be what helped me. That was the moment I decided to just finish the game for the story and put it away for good."

Edit: You are right that the rumors could have been a misunderstanding of what turned out to be Hero Mode."
