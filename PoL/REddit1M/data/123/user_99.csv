Can I still think it's absolutely shit, though? Not just with the handholding and linearity, that is. Somehow, *nothing* in the game meshed well with me. Not the story, not the characters, not the gameplay, and dare I say it, *not even the music*. ^Yes ^I'm ^serious.

Well, that wouldn't  be completely true. There are some tracks which I think are the best in the series to me, but I do dislike the soundtrack overall."
