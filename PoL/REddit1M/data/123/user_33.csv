13916,"When you first find a dungeon map in first dungeon, it gives you the item description: ""this is a dungeon map! It shows you where you are."" Alright, fine. That's standard, happens any time you grab something from a chest. Then the map automatically opens, to show you what it is and does... again. And alright, I was going to do that anyway, to get an idea of the dungeon layout. Then I close the map and FUCKING FI is like ""hey dumbass, this is a map! Let me explain what it is, since you clearly didn't figure it out from the two previous explanations the game gave you"".

Everything that OP said is true, but he completely ignored the problem that keeps me and many others from enjoying the game."

Sure, Midna often treats Link like an idiot. But Fi treats the *player* like an idiot."
14393,"Fi made it a 4-5/10 for me instead of an 8-9/10 like the art direction, story, and music should have made it. Fi and other overly hand-holdy elements kept me from enjoying the game."

20675,"Yes, BotW went a different way and may have done so as a reaction to the criticism of SS. But *OP* didn't mention it at all."
23068,"4 or 5 out of 10, is what I meant."
