22835,"I finally beat TP the week before BotW came out, and Midna is the thing I miss most about the transition. Having grown up mainly with Sahasrahla and Navi, Midna was so excellent. She's got a personality, but also mostly stays quiet, and actually provides gameplay benefits (helping Wolf Link jump around), plus she's a big part of the story. TP benefited greatly from Midna. From all I've heard about Fi, I'm not looking forward to SS nearly as much."
