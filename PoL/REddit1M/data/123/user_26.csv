10725,"Both OOT Ganondorf and Windwaker Ganondorf had a personality, because in those two games he was still a man. In OOT, he laughs as you lead him to the sacred realm as a child. He enjoys the fact that you've given him exactly what he needed to succeed, and he thinks it's funny that by trying to save the world, you've given it to him. When you confront him as an adult, he's playing the piano just to mock you. To show that he's so far beyond you, he's not even bothering to prepare for the fight. He glories in his strength.

In Windwaker, sealed beneath the Ocean, he's become melancholy. He doesn't laugh at you anymore. His personality has changed after achieving his goal of conquering Hyrule, and finding that it brought him nothing.

Ganon (as opposed to Ganondorf) is closer to a force than a person. That's by design, to create the feeling that you're not just trying to face down an ordinary man. In the original Zelda, Ganon is a mindless evil with no dialogue whatsoever. In Link, the failure of your quest ends with his resurrection. And he's so powerful that it's a foregone conclusion that no one can stop him if you fail. There's not even a thought that Ganon might make a mistake, or that might just decide to leave the world alone and live in peace. You die, he's resurrected, the world ends. That knowledge raises the stakes, even though he never appears in the game outside of the Game Over screen.

Calamity Ganon takes that concept of Ganon as a force to it's logical conclusion. He is no longer a man. He no longer even has a physical body, in any meaningful sense. He has become nothing but hatred and is embodied by the destruction that he creates.

You do have to read between the lines, but Ganondorf does have a distinct character. And as the timeline branches out, you can see how different events change him. Each game gives you a fuller sense of who he is and what he has become. "
