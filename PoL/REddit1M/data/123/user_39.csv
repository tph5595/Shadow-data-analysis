19336,"I agree with you totally, but to play devil's advocate for a sec, maybe none of that is true if you aren't an anime fan? Like, I know about it because I used to like anime like 20 years ago. But I'm sure that there are a fair number of Zelda fans who don't watch or even have any knowledge of anime. If your experience with Japanese entertainment is only Zelda, then both the story and the villain are very original. 

But, again, I do agree with you. "
36235,"Yeah. I think you were right about the anime angle. I think that they were going for an anime-style game but still Zelda. 

I personally enjoyed Skyward Sword. Mechanically, it was my favorite until BotW. But the anime stuff was kind of annoying to me, probably more because I don't really care for anime anymore (except for Cowboy Bebop, which is still my favorite thing...oh, and Princess Mononoke) than because I found it unoriginal. And Fi was so damned annoying. Worse than Navi. But, while I didn't care for Ghirahim's personality or look, I thought that he made for really solid fights and was a good villain over all. But, yeah, I think your points about the anime stuff are spot-on. "
82936,Totally. Now I just want a Princess Mononoke game at in this world.
