The game comes out, soon after everyone hates it, then two games down the road they look back and realize it was amazing. We must be patient. Like, it's unfortunate this game had a lot of hand-holding, but everything else about it is amazing! Most people are just too simple to be able to rise above the Zelda Hate Cycle ;)"

This happened with majora's mask (""the time mechanic breaks the game""), windwaker (""the art style is stupid""), twilight princess (""it's just a shitty OOT""). Pretty much it goes game comes out --&gt; game is hated --&gt; all the sudden everyone loves it. So when the next zelda game comes out, mark my words everyone will be singing skyward sword's praises. "
84868,"You misunderstand me. These games are loved when they come out, as skyward sword was (http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword). Peak hate for a zelda game happens around the time the next one comes out, which has been the case with the past four. So, that's pretty solid evidence! In my humble opinion... ^.~*"
87957,"I must not be making myself clear. Peak hate for a zelda game, according to my understanding of The Zelda Hate Cycle (TM) is when the following game comes out. But maybe we are seeing different reactions on different parts of the internet, and so we will have to agree to disagree. I personally really enjoyed skyward sword and I hope nobody misses out on it because of salty internet folk :)"
