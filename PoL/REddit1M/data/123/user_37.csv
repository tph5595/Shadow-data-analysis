18773,"Honestly, I think Skyward Sword's two biggest failings was the sheer amount of hand holding forced on us, and the one who delivered all that hand holding, Fi. Fi has her moments where it almost seems like she has a personality, but most players will never realize it because she forces you to listen to so much unnecessary hand holding that one can just tune out 90% of what she says. Which is a shame, because Skyward Sword does a great job making you care about Zelda, so you know they could have done the same for Fi.  "
