But even putting that aside, the story and character style conflicted with the [Cezanne-inspired visual style](https://www.google.com/search?q=cezanne&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch). The visuals seem to emphasize natural serenity, maturity, reflection, abstraction. The storyline had a lot of exaggerated emotion, smirks, early-teen-style snark. The combination was frequently jarring.
