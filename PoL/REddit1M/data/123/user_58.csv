28417,"There were a couple issues I had. The big one is obviously the handholding, such as you obtaining an item (with a little text to describe how it works) followed by Fi describing the item for you. Sky flight segments were slow, repetitive, and often unnecessary. The lore could've been interesting, but there was a lot of wasted potential and Fi is cancer. The difficulty curve depends largely on your ability to shield bash, wield the motion controls well, and use your slingshot/bow before battles- a first playthrough can be exciting/difficult because every encounter is a mini-puzzle, but you can stomp on the game once you figure them out. The Imprisoned issue of an interesting boss overstaying its welcome because of repetition sucked. The contrivances in the plot were mildly irritating. The puzzle solving and scope of the dungeons and challenges were generally lower than in other games, since a big challenge was just the motion controls- as I said above, once you got good at them, much of the scope falls away, but this applies to dungeons as well. 

You did mention a lot of the things it did well, and I love the game, but it's a level below basically all of the other full 3D Zelda titles. I didn't inherently have issues with the motion controls- they could have used more polish, and I only played TP on GC- but other aspects of the game were lacking."
