7128,"""Master, your hearts are low, in case you didn't notice from the constant beeping, red flashing and Link panting.  Master, your batteries are running low.  Master, you haven't had a chance to look at this puzzle yet.  *Camera pans* Here is exactly what you have to do to solve it.""

Never experienced hand-holding lol.  Aonuma himself even admitted how bad the handholding was and how it was a mistake, which is why there's none in BotW."
7674,"&gt;And Ghirahim! What an original and novel villain

Is this... satire? I'm sorry, Ghirahim is basically a copypasta of every bishounen, white-haired anime creeper pawn out there.  His ""character"" was a dead horse by 2004, let alone 2011.  It's probably the least original thing Nintendo has ever done.  He's every generic creepy bad guy from every shounen anime rolled into one huge cliche.

I enjoyed his fights, but as a character... I couldn't come up with something more generic.

The story in general was probably my least favorite thing about SS, and my least favorite Zelda story.  What wasn't pure, tired anime tropes was half-assed and forced explanation for the series' old questions.  It is the absolute definition of cheap shounen writing and storytelling.  You can find almost perfect matches in generic shounen anime for nearly every scene in SS.  The opening sequence is scene-for-scene nothing but absolute tropes lifted from your typical highschool animes.  The whole ""old friends in high school with crushes on eachother are faced with world-dooming drama and separated"" is so done to the death that it's nearly unforgivable.  It's compounded by the fact that it all follows the *same old* ""I'm gonna lean close to your face so it looks like I'm about to kiss you, JK, haha you fell over!"" cliche scene.

I couldn't stop cringing through that one.  It's like they listed a bunch of the most generic shounen animes on a wall and threw a dart to determine which one they were going to copy at which point.  Not that it would have mattered where the dart landed, because they're all the same rehashed corn-fest anyway.  I really feared for Zelda's story direction after that, and while BotW's story was pretty lackluster it at least wasn't made up entirely of the corniest tropes ever to grace generic anime."
8845,"Everything has a battery warning.  Skyward Sword just managed to handle it in the most annoying way possible, by - like with everything else - pausing the game and taking way too long to tell you something you probably already knew.  It wouldn't be bad by itself, but combined with all the other ""STOP! Here's 20 seconds of dialogue for something you already knew"" sequences, it's just annoying and unnecessary. An indicator in the corner or sound would have worked fine, like it does everywhere else."
10026,"Ganondorf is pretty generic in most games too, but I'll take generic in the classic ""fairytale evil guy"" sense over the ""cringey anime snark"" sense any day.

At least Ganondorf's design is somewhat unique with his height, giant ass nose, greenish brown skin and red hair.  Ghriahim is seriously just ""anime badguy design V. 34577429"", down to the stupid white hair swoop.

And I'll also take Ganondorf's calm, confident attitude turned scary rage, over Grihahim's snarky ass arrogance turned hissy fit any day.

Ganondorf is like Darth Vader.  Ghirahim is like Anakin.  I can't really word it better than that."
49519,"&gt;you should know youre low on hearts or you're mentally handicapped. 

That's literally why it's handholding.  The definition of handholding is constantly babying you as if you have no clue what you're doing.  Hence the name ""hand holding"" because it's treating you like a toddler.

Everybody knows they're low on hearts, yes.  The game assumes you don't, and thus makes sure to tell you in 500 different ways.  That's handholding.  It assumes you're too stupid to ""cross the street"" without help, so it ""holds your hand."""
82272,"If a Zelda came out with a story tone in-line with Bebop or Princess Mononoke I would lose my mind.  It'd be the first time in Zelda that I actually enjoyed the story as much as the gameplay.  BotW already has a Princess Mononoke kind of vibe, it just doesn't have the same quality (in the story department).

Even with voice acting of that quality, BotW's story would be leagues better than it is.  They really need to work on their stories feeling like low-budget anime.  It's basically their only weak point and if they built a new narrative team, the games could be twice as impressive.  Imagine if BotW not only had its fantastic gameplay, but fantastic story and acting as well."
82469,"This gave me a good chuckle.  They don't even need to discover books to find something that blows SS's story away.  Even a movie adaptation of a book would far, far outclass anything in SS, in most cases.

Like, Tolkien's books are better than the Lord of the Ring movies, yeah?  Even at that, the LotR movies make SS's story look like a joke.  Harry Potter?  Easily.  Hell even Star Wars would be a few hundred steps up."
83019,"&gt;It's literally just a shipper's fanfic with dramatic cinematics.

Ugh thank you.  People praise it so much, I feel like I must be delusional to think that, but that is *absolutely* the best way to describe it.  It's like a (bad) fan-fiction.

So it has romance.  So what?  Since when has corny romance been a critically acclaimed aspect of story telling?  Pretty much never.  The widely-accepted ""better version"" of ""The Hobbit"" is the one that cuts out the pointless, shoehorned romance.  It's like that weird sub-section of fans who likes to draw pictures of Zelda and Link kissing got a game aimed straight at them like that was somehow a good idea.  I can't comprehend how anyone could quantify that as a good story... unless they're the kind of person to fantasizes about Zelda and Link kissing."
83452,"&gt;Most people are just too simple to be able to rise above the Zelda Hate Cycle ;)

This ""cycle"" is literally an excuse to dismiss other people's opinions as if they're imaginary.  It doesn't exist.  If it did, everyone would be hating on BotW like it's the worst game in the series and loving Skyward Sword.

But that *obviously* isn't the case, just like the Zelda cycle *obviously* isn't real.  SS got hate when it came out, and it still gets hate today.  It will get hate with the next Zelda game, too.  It's never going to magically pop into some beloved title just because you want people to like it.

Basically, what you're saying is ""nostalgia will make people like it more"" and that's true for *all* things but it's not going to suddenly make everyone love it.  Even at that, if anything SS's hate has grown since people have played it multiple times now and realized its flaws."
83628,"Hell, with BotW's engine they could pop out a Princess Mononoke game in very little time.  I've always wanted to see Nintendo work with Ghibli and that would be a perfect fit for what they just worked so hard on."
86570,"No, Skyward Sword wasn't loved when it came out.  It got good reviews (like literally every Zelda game ever making this a moot point) but fans hated on it just like they do today.

&gt;Peak hate for a zelda game happens around the time the next one comes out

Let's see:

Ocarina of Time comes out.  People love it.

Majora's Mask comes out.  It's divisive. People still love OoT.

Wind Waker comes out.  People hate on the art style.  Majora's Mask's reception does not change, nor does OoT's.

Twilight Princess comes out.  People love it.  Best-selling Zelda game of all time aside from the original.  Wind Waker's reception gets even better too once people get over the art style.

Skyward Sword comes out.  It's riddled with complaints of motion controls and linearity.  One of the worst-selling Zelda games of all time, despite being on *the best selling console ever*. Twilight Princess is still regarded with praise, to the point where the most common complaint of SS is ""why isn't this more like TP?""  Around this time Majora's Mask is gaining the reputation of a ""cult classic"".

Breath of the Wild comes out.  People love it. Skyward Sword still gets the same hate that it *always did*.

Beyond that, your perception of the Zelda cycle isn't even accurate.  The ""Zelda Cycle"" states that the newest Zelda always gains the most hate (which was the excuse for SS's hate until now), while the game preceding it goes from hated to loved because nostalgia, but that isn't true either, otherwise everyone would hate BotW and love SS right now.

The only ones who actually believe in the ""cycle"" are new fans who weren't around for the previous game's releases, and want to make their opinion on the new title seem more legitimate.

SS is never going to become some beloved title.  You can keep living delusions to make your opinion seem more ""right"" if you want, but if you actually want to test it, make a reminder for when the next Zelda game comes out."
89133,"You say that, but then you also just said:

&gt;game comes out --&gt; game is hated

Is it the prior game that gets hated, or the game that just came out?  And where is this imaginary BotW hate?  It's almost universally praised.

So far you've described two versions of a Zelda cycle.  In one of your claims, the *most current game* is hated:

&gt;This happened with majora's mask (""the time mechanic breaks the game""), windwaker (""the art style is stupid""), twilight princess (""it's just a shitty OOT""). Pretty much it goes game comes out --&gt; game is hated

In another claim, it's the *prior game* which is hated:

&gt;Peak hate for a zelda game, according to my understanding of The Zelda Hate Cycle (TM) is when the following game comes out.

Which contradicts your other statement.  So now you've said the most current Zelda game gets hated, and also the peak hate for Zelda is when it's the second newest title.  So everyone just hates the two newest Zelda games?  Because that isn't close to true either.  

You're moving around the goalpost in an attempt to make it seem like there's some magical pattern which will eventually make the game you like become beloved by all.  There isn't.  The only two games where opinion has ever changed on a grand scale were Majora's Mask (just BARELY) and Wind Waker (which was never *hated*, it just shocked people with its art style).

All you're doing is making up imaginary rules for why your opinion is right, and why everyone else's is dictated by an imaginary cycle and thus ""wrong.""  It's basically an elaborate way to say ""nuh uh I'm right and everyone else is wrong because magic cycle. you'll see in time!"""
91850,"Yup. It's not okay to pretend everyone else's opinion is moot because of a magical cycle; that only yours will be agreed on in time.  That's pretty hypocritical, bruh.

Prior to BotW, ""cyclists"" claimed the most current game was hated, and *that's* why SS got flak.  Now that BotW is out - and SS still gets flak - suddenly, prior is hated, even though that has never been true.  It's almost like you're trying to find magical excuses, rather than admit the flaws people cite.

Soon it's gonna be 10 years old, and you'll still be waiting for that magical reception swap."
173007,"Yeah, Zant is similar to Ghirahim in some ways, but it was handled in a much more original, and believable way.  He felt like someone who was legitimately twisted in the head, who put on a stoic front because he *was* powerful, but completely lost it when his power was challenged.  And the way he lost it was perfect.  He wasn't just some teenage-esque kid with an attitude problem, he was insane and deluded and you had to really fight to bring him to that.  

He was unique all-around.  If we're just talking about character design, he's probably one of the most unique in the series.  His presentation was perfect, and it made sense.  He was scary, because he was beyond you (until a certain point).

Ghirahim was just... in your way with an annoying attitude.  Like a kid in high-school who keeps trying to start a fight with you even though he keeps getting his ass handed to him.  There was no justification for his arrogance, he was just a brat."
