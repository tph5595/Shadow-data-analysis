0,"Skyward Sword seems to be getting a lot of flak these days with the release of Breath of the Wild. I can see where a lot of the criticisms come from. What is perhaps the greatest game of all time was just released that utterly capitalizes on the largest complaint of Skyward Sword, its linearity.

And yes, that criticism is absolutely warranted. Much of us who played the Skyward Sword desired nothing more than to escape the seemingly arbitrary bounds of the world in which we found ourselves; perhaps we yearned for that release simply because the world was so enchanting.

But let us not forgot the wonder of Skyward Sword. The breathtaking soundtrack that was so expertly interwoven around our experience. The wonderfully crafted storyline where we get to see a believable relationship develop between Zelda and Link as they reached for their destinies. The humanity present in their relationship and trials elevated the story to a moving and emotive experience.

 And Ghirahim! What an original and novel villain! Ghirahim was weird, unpredictable, fashionable, and deadly. Ghirahim felt like an actual person who experienced his own personal victories and failures as he strove to effectuate his goals. Battling Ghirahim felt like a real conflict, where a every attack was an opportunity to gain the upper hand.

Which brings us to a particularly divisive topic: Skyward Sword's gameplay. Motion controls are often looked down upon like they are a children's plaything. Nintendo answered that skepticism by creating a game that exemplified what the controls on the Wii should have been: a nuanced control scheme that bolsters gameplay through innovative design. Skyward Sword was centralized around this control scheme and the core experience and gameplay shined because of it.

Yes, that core gameplay was not as subtle as in Breath of the Wild. Perhaps it was even a little forced. Still, playing as Link in Skyward Sword, you experienced the genesis of the Legend of Zelda through the mechanic of the ""Skyward Sword"", the central theme of the story. This mechanic gave you access to the experience of *being Link* that until then had never truly been realized in a Zelda game. I believe that a quote from the game will exhibit this quality better than I can.

Zelda tells Link at one pivotal point in the story:

&gt; During your long journey, you've grown so much. You learn **wisdom** from solving devious puzzles and traps. You gained **power** by honing and tempering both yourself and your sword. And by overcoming the trials set before you by the goddess, you've found true **courage**.

Breath of the Wild took that idea of *experiencing playing as Link* to a whole new level through all its interlaced and ingenuous mechanics, and with arguably much more grace than its predecessor. Though, I wonder if Breath of the Wild could have achieved its brilliance without employing Skyward Sword as a necessary stepping stone.

I argue that the developers took Skyward Sword's wonders and faults and transformed them into the masterpiece that is Breath of the Wild. In other words, Skyward Sword's growing pains became Breath of the Wild's greatest joys.

Still, I do not think that we, as fans of the Legend of Zelda franchise, could not have hoped for a better origin story than Skyward Sword. If you wish for a refresher, then watch Skyward Sword movie, which has all the cutscenes stitched together. The link is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yuk4YDJh_EI

Tl;dr: Skyward Sword may be the last formulaic entry in the Legend of Zelda franchise, but I hope that it is remembered for its humanistic qualities and experiential gameplay that made it the masterpiece it is.
