Skyward sword is the only main zelda I haven't beaten, so I don't have much to say. But I just couldn't enjoy the montion controls. They worked fine, but it's just not for me. I watced the story on youtube after playing about 3 hours. I felt like I was still in the tutorial.

I don't like the game. Zelda has always been my favorite series, it's a shame there is one I won't beat."
