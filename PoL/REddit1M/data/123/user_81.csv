45576,"My boyfriend adores Skyward Sword and it was his favourite Zelda game (Breath of the Wild beating it now!). I never had a chance to play it until I met him, but when I did get round to trying it out, I found that the game was unplayable for me due to the motion controls. Each fight was tedious and frustrating because of the controls and I did not want to continue playing, which is a shame because I was enjoying other things like story, characters etc. 

Perhaps one day Nintendo will remaster Skyward Sword but without motion controls. When that day comes, then I will complete the game."
