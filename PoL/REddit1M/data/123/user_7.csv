2847,"I never experienced hand holding in this game tbh, sure Fi helped quite a bit but it's not like she told you exactly what to do. And either way a lot of the time you had to ask. 

I do think Skyward Sword had the best music though. Fi's farewell still makes me tear up ) :"

I mean I rarely got low often enough for it to be annoying but maybe thats just me. I get thats annoying but I wouldnt call it handholding."
48820,"Interesting, usually I just kinda ignored her except for actual dialogue parts with zelda or smth. As soon as she popped up the first time I just kinda didn't care.

Also I wouldn't call it handholding for the hearts thing. Sure it was annoying but it wasn't handholdy. For real though, I don't remember the handholding."
