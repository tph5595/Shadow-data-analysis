24296,"It's definitely a mixed bag. 

The story is fantastic in my opinion, the gameplay is mostly fine, the art style is cool, and it has memorable characters and music. But it's a bit too linear, Fi is extremely annoying, and it has a lot of tedious backtracking and collection quests (the Water dragon song quest is one of the worst levels I've played in an otherwise good game).

I still think it's alright and a mid-tier Zelda game. I actually like it a little better than Majora's Mask, which has gotten me crucified online a couple times, since that game has so many fans for some reason.
