2022,"My issue with slyward sword was about how fi would come out and repeat what was said by an NPC pretty much 10 seconds before. It's the amount of tediousness in the travel between worlds and how slow the bird is. The biggest complaints to me aren't because of the story or the gameplay its more how dumbed down and slow the mechanics are, it treated the players like infants throughout the game. "
