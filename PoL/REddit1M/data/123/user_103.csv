In fact, to make it more challenging for myself I played through the entire game on hero mode with no shield. Fighting with no shield makes every move you make more risky as you have nothing to guard you from an enemies attack should you fail to land a hit or dodge the attack. Not to mention it takes away the shield bash too. This made the fights with Ghirahim wayy more exciting and made me feel like a real badass tbh!"
