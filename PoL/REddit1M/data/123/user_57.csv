27879,"I don't agree with the notion that open-world is this grand evolution of earlier linear games. They're two different ways of realising a game-world each with its own benefits. Skyward Sword was glorious on the first playthrough. The reason I like BotW so much better than SS may be largely due to the timing of its release. 13 years of console Zelda games following the Ocarina of Time formula leaves you hungry for something new, and boy was BotW something new.

Still, I would pay **a lot** for a Skyward Sword remake on the Switch. Full graphical overhaul, a more dense skyloft and a less nagging Fi."
