247277,I hated skyward sword.  I'd give it a 6/10 on an IGN weighted scale.   Absolutely broken motion controls for me.  Story I felt was terrible fan service.  Didn't like Ghirahim.  Hated the hub world / no over world mechanic.  I never even finished it.  And don't get me started on my seething hated for Fi...
248023,I only ever got 2 dungeons in but the so called story was maddeningly awful fan service.  
250989,Except it was literally broken for many people.  My first encounter with Ghirahim literally took over 20 minutes because the controller would not accept my input and deliver the properly angled slashes.  I tried multiple Wii motes too.  I found the game u playable and gave up.  And calling people who don't like the motion controls fat nerds is just sad on your part.
251077,I'd give it 6-10 on the IGN scale. That's how much I hated SS
251197,It's this kind of thinking that allows abominations like SS to go unchecked.
