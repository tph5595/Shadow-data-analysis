31254,The look on her face also looks like she's distressed. Is this supposed to be some Zelda rape scene? 
36162,Because she looks more threatened than embarrassed.
39145,"Sexually suggestive, vulnerable positioning away from the first person perspective, a look that says more terrified or distraught. The elements definitely add up to be rapey."
47991,"That's the risk and the costly education of publishing work. I would take you at your word that you didn't mean it to come across that way. She comes across as very vulnerable and very distressed and then you also see that she's presented with a full side-breast view despite no clothing ever fitting in such a way. You also have her exposed with the bed sheets being pulled down. On top of that, she's recoiling away from the viewer's perspective and being very feebly defensive while being scantily clad. Sorry but it just comes across that way.

I wouldn't look to demonize you...but just give my impressions from what I see. It's a lot like other things in life where you look to communicate one thing but it comes across another way. There's some trigger points (and I hate the word trigger for this shit)."
49407,Cheers and I do respect the work that goes into it but the audience impression is something you don't find out until later (I've had the same experience myself in the past). I'd gladly buy you a drink of your choosing if we were to hang out ever. :D
50466,Let me know when you're in the Los Angeles area. (or if you're already here!)
