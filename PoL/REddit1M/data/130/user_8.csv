20872,I never said that that was a bad thing. Not at all.
32753,"&gt;Remotely pornographic

Like a pin-up. Which this is. Porn doesn't need to contain ""sexually explicit conduct"" to still be a type of porn, it only needs to contain something that is sexually suggestive. This is a pin-up, which is a type of soft pornography. That doesn't mean that it violates reddit's or this subreddit's rules, that doesn't mean it should be considered demonizing to call it what it is, and that doesn't mean that it's bad in any way. I'm not antagonizing you, OP, I'm simply pointing out that your classification of this image as not being ""remotely pornographic"" is incorrect. That's it."
33857,Do... do you know what a pin-up is?
34734,To the last part of your comment: I'VE BEEN FUCKING SAYING THAT IT ISN'T A PROBLEM FROM THE FUCKING BEGINNING
34889,"Image search ""pin-up"" and tell me that this isn't one. It's clearly a pin-up. Pin-ups originated as stand-ins for porn where actual porn wouldn't be allowed, such as in a military."
35328,"You also gave me the ""definition"" of a pin-up girl, not a pin-up. They're separate things."
35495,"soft porn, totally different from regular porn, the term accounts for pretty much everything that's (for lack of a better term) ""fap-worthy"", but not necessarily sexually explicit."
47925,"Doesn't look like anybody other than me knows I'm right and that making a massive deal about this in the first place was stupid, since I qualified my original statements by saying that it wasn't a big deal and that I wasn't accusing OP of posting something that they should not have.

Quit while I'm ahead? I'll always be ahead, other people don't have to agree with me for me to be right about something. I was not convinced that I was wrong, therefore I still know that I'm right."
