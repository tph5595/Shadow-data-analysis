I think you're the real creep here. It almost looks like you're trying to be a white knight for a girl who doesn't even exist...."
49507,"What do you mean they didn't need to be? The boobs could be big or small, the artist is the one who decides, not you."

53623,"But you're really not giving any constructive criticism...

All you're doing is telling him ""I don't like that her boobs are big."" And you know what? That's just your personal opinion of the art. You aren't giving any helpful advice to try and make him a better artist.

Just because Zelda's breasts are slightly large in this image does not make him any less of a good artist. 

So the point is, you're not actually giving any critique at all. You're just complaining about the artist's decision on Zelda's bust.."
60596,"He doesn't have to be extremely accurate when drawing Zelda, this could be his interpretation of her. There is no rule saying fan art must be 100% accurate to the actual source. When fans make fan art, they usually take their own liberties.

And honestly, to me it sounds like you're saying big boobs = sexy click bait. Is he not allowed to give Zelda slightly large breasts? It's not even like the art is shoving them in your face, they're completely covered with clothing and you can only see the side of them.

Let's say she had smaller breasts in the image but was in the exact same pose with the same clothing, would that be alright then? So characters are not allowed to be drawn with a slight bigger bust or else it is deemed ""cheap""? "
84969,"No. I still think you're over exaggerating about her chest.

Like I said before, they're not in your face and are completely covered. The only sexualization going on with her chest is the fact that it even exists. If you want to talk about sexualization, I'd rather you mention things such as how we can almost see under her shorts. But her chest? I see no issues with it. So what if the artist made them a little bigger? And yes, I mean a little bigger, not a lot. He didn't giver her two giant melons like other artists have in the past.

God forbid Nintendo's next iteration of Zelda has a medium sized bust, or else people such as yourself will start complaining until the end of time. 

This argument is going nowhere though, bye."
