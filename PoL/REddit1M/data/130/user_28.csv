39424,"Whoa, thanks for sharing my art! I read some of the comments, and it wasn't my intention to make her look too young, or over sexualized. That's just my failure as an artist. I was going for a cute picture of the character embarrassed for snuggling with a plushy. Mainly for giggles, you know? Don't get weird about it! XD"
40752,Thanks! I will try to do better in the future. :)
42460,"Thank you! I just wanted to show a cute picture, not something creepy. XD"
44314,"I still have a lot to learn about how to create realistic fabric, so count it as an artistic failure, if it looks weird. I'll do better next time! XP
"
44418,"Ew gross! It's just supposed to be a silly cute pic, not creepy. If it doesn't look good, count it as artistic failure, because that wasn't my intention. XD"
49212,"Thanks for the input! While I am no politician, I have no intention of triggering others, despite the fact that avoiding such is impossible. 
As for the garment, I agree, her breasts turned out too large for the character. However, My wife wears a similar gown to bed, and actually this is how if fits her. It's comfy, yet stretchy. I hope you forgive me if I do not post ref pics. XD
My intention was to give her a cute ""No, it's mine!"" kind of expression, like she is defending the weirdness of the situation. None the less, it doesn't translate that way to everyone. Most people on my DA page got it, but then again, they are familiar with my sense of humor. In the end, it's just a bit of silliness from my noggin'. I don't draw hentai, or rape scenes, or anything gross like that. Cheesecake and sexy pinups, sure! This piece, however, was not meant to be overtly sexual. 
All that said, I can't argue the point you have made. You are entitled your opinion and I appreciate the perspective. I will certainly take this notion with me as I continue this series. "
49234,I'll do my best!
49246,Oh really? 
50386,"That's right! We don't know till we try! 
And thanks, I'd take you up on that! :D"
138228,"I am a north cal boy, up in humboldt county. I don't make it down to LA often, but I'll keep that in mind! :D"
138382,"No I understand. It's all good, people see what they see. :)
As for the boobs, I agree they are too big. My wife wears a night gown like this, and this is what it looks like when she squeezes something against her chest. Partly the inspiration, I suppose. However, I agree that the degree of detail in the fabric takes away from the primary focus, which is supposed to be how she's a bit embarrassed about the plushy. 
Thanks for the comment!"
138441,"I totally agree. If I tried to protect everyone, I'd end up drawing nothing. "
138560,"Thanks for the support, I appreciate it. 
My commission info her right here:
http://ronindude.deviantart.com/journal/COMMISSION-FAQ-507996438

My list is pretty full, but I finish work nearly daily. If you have an idea, you can email me or note me via DA with the details, and I will get you the actual price. I'd love to hear from ya!"
139175,"That's not the reason I made them bigger. As I stated before, it's a mistake in my skills. I am sure you understand that artists don't always accurately portray thier intentions? It takes a lot of skill to make something exactly as you see it in your head. There is a lot wrong with this. But to assume that I did it intentionally for the page views is a bit presumptuous. If I wanted that I would have just drawn her naked. "
141213,"Well, I guess I can take it as a compliment that you think I am perfectly accurate in bringing my intentions to the canvas! However, I am more inclined to assume you just aren't familiar with the drawing process. I probably redid the sketch for this about 3 times, and almost quit when I couldn't get the eyes right. I still don't care for how her face turned out. Her expression was intended to be a bit embarrassed, but it came out a bit scared. By bad. I was kinda surprised that there was so much fuss about her boobs!

Never the less, no need to be so combative, friend! It's just a silly drawing, and I am not as good as you give credit!"
141461,"Also, drawing the same sized boobs is a crutch of mine that I am familiar with. Much like how many of my characters have similar faces. I hate that, and I DO want to do better and add more variety. I am not trying to defend the breast size, only that I still have a lot to learn. I wasn't doing it for the views, only because it's my comfort zone. I hope I am explaining myself well. "
