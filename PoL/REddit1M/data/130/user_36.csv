If this had been posted as an imgur album with [this picture of yours](http://ronindude.deviantart.com/art/Speed-Sketch-Zelda-s-favorite-toy-532968728) as the first image I'd be willing to bet they'd be gushing even more over how much she likes the doll and how cute it is.

They're seeing a girl with wider than anatomically normal eyes and no pants on and presuming she's about to be harmed. It's sick.

The boobs are a bit odd though. They'd have to be pretty big to look similar to that when at rest."

You're doing a *lot* of projecting here. She bought a stuffed toy of link, then when it was time for bed she changed into something else and cuddled it. Just because you see it doesn't mean it's happening.

Her breasts are literally covered, the artist isn't the greatest with fabric, and she's doing nothing sexual. You're the one who's weird projecting little girls into this."
