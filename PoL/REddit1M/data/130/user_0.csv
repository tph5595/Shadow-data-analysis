Basically, unless you are sucking, feeling, fucking, or showing off your junk, it ain't porn, son."

33022,"Porn by nature and definition is sexually explicit content. I gave you the legal definition. There is not even nudity. You know what else is ""slightly suggestive""? Bikinis. Unless you think beaches are pornshoots, (actually, even if you do) I emphatically disagree with any assessment that considers this porn. It's not porn. Not by even the most puritanical definition. This is just cute. "

&gt;A pin-up girl, also known as a pin-up model, is a model whose mass-produced pictures see wide appeal as popular culture. Pin-ups are intended for informal display, i.e. meant to be ""pinned-up"" on a wall. Pin-up girls may be glamour models, fashion models, or actresses.

&gt;These pictures are also sometimes known as cheesecake photos.

&gt;The term pin-up may also refer to drawings, paintings, and other illustrations done in emulation of these photos (see the list of pin-up artists). The term was first attested to in English in 1941; however, the practice is documented back at least to the 1890s.

That awkward moment when even the common man definition of pin up doesn't mention porn. "
