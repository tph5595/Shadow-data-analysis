34192,"Do you even understand what pornographic means? If you think this is porn, you sound very sheltered or sexually intimidated. *Ahem: Her ankles are showing?! Good heavens!*

[This is softcore porn. Yes, SPOILERS, it is NSFW.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Softcore_pornography) OP's image is, by contrast, not NSFW.

Even if it were porn, hot dayum, would you have a problem with it? Keep 'em coming, OP. I'm a huge ZeLink fan ;) &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3"
35023,"*Reads back through comments.* Ah okay cool, got me there, but more importantly, OP's image is not porn."
36407,"What you are describing seems more along the lines of ""naughty,"" for lack of a more succinct term. There is a difference between ""naughty"" and porn. More along the lines of ""ecchi"" but even then, that can respectively be more explicit than the vague idea of ""pin-ups."" OP's image could be a pin-up, sure, but that doesn't directly imply it's pornographic.

Sure, pin-ups absolutely have sexual themes, but that doesn't necessarily make them sexually explicit. That's not to say there aren't pornographic pin-ups out there (trust me, there are). 

But, as far as anyone's concerned, Zelda has her dungeon and Bongo-Bongo's covered up. That, and Link ain't explorin' nor is she. "
