30905,"&gt;her tits are completely on display

They're literally entirely covered up. The only way they're ""on display"" is that they exist. And this is pretty much exactly what my girlfriend, age 23, wears to bed, and she still cuddles a stuffed doll when she sleeps too. Link is 17 in Skyward Sword, which is the game that this design is from, and Zelda is generally considered to be in the same age group. I'm not sure why you're projecting ""little girl"" onto this but it's not right."
