30469,"The boobs didn't need to be so big, but it's a cute picture. "
48869,"Nothing, it's just not at all what she looked like in the game. I think it makes the picture a bit over sexualized when really it didn't need to be at all.  "
49900,"Right, that's what an opinion is. The artist is allowed to have his, you're allowed to have yours, and I'm allowed to have mine. "
49946,"Right, but as the viewer I'm encouraged to critique it. Not all art is good art, and I think this one is being held back by the sexualization. "
55818,"Correct. I think the artist made a bad decision about Zeldas breasts. Making them smaller would have been more accurate, less sexual, and in my opinion made the picture better. It's clear why he made them the way he did, and I think that sexualization is a cheap way to get more people to look at your art. "
62225,"The fact that they're large, perfectly round, and her shirt clings to them screams sexualization to me. And don't make it out to seem like they're not that much bigger than the game portrays, they're massive. [This is her from Skyward Sword](http://gamingtrend.com/wp-content/screenshots/the-leged-of-zelda-skyward-sword/Zelda_Skyward_929_25.png). It's not just a slight change, it's a complete overhaul of her breasts. 

I don't have a problem with people drawing or looking sexual artwork, but don't try and pass it off as anything else. "
62611,"That sort of speaks for the state of the sub doesn't it? But I guess at the same time the last game released was in 2013 and the next game won't be release until 2016, so we're in a bit of a dry spell. "
88644,"They're within the realm of possibility in size, but still really big for a human. But there's no point in continuing this. I've said all I have to say, and so have you. "
140073,A mistake in your skills? I don't follow. So many of your drawings feature characters with large breasts that's sort of hard to believe.
