38349,"To me it felt too long because of the lack of variation in the zones. 3 zones I need to go to again and again and again. Yes they change a little bit but after all these are the same three zones.

I mean, I had fun with this game so it did it's job but all the time the only thing I could think of was: ""They wasted so much potential."" 

The zones were levels instead of part of an open and living world, flying around felt forced and, to me, annoying most of the time (I need to play through most of the game before I actually need to fight while flying). Flying could've been such a cool feature but it should be about freedom, I felt like being in a cage with very few things to explore. Compare it to the sailing in WW. Sailing could be annoying too but it felt like an open world you could explore.

And the motion controls. Opinions differ and I am not sure what to think about them. It's nice to have these but they weren't great enough as a feature to focus that heavily on them.

I agree with you on the stamina bar though."
79079,"You are right, especially about the desert, that the variation in the zones itself wasn't bad it was more about the feeling it gave me. A dominant thought I had while playing was: ""I need to go there AGAIN?"". The game didn't manage to encourage me to there. Of course these are my feelings and so they can differ. I get why you didn't feel like that but to me it was a negative thing.

&gt;I find a series of disconnected zones that are packed full of stuff to do and things happening in them to feel more ""alive"" than those zones still existing (Zora's River, Death Mountain Trail, etc.) but all connecting to a giant, flat, empty field.

But it wasn't happening that much. The most, to me, interesting sidequests happened in the sky, which made sense since that's where the humans were but the sky wasn't really connected to the rest of world (items falling down aside). It was a world in itself. And that's okay but it's not what I expect from a Zelda game. To be fair, it's hard to connect sky and land without making every zone available from the beginning of the game. Limiting the areas you can go to at the beginning of the game is much easier when you can't fly.

Let's compare it to OoT. You're right, the field was mostly empty, but this made sense (just like an isolated sky, to be fair) because some travellers aside you wouldn't expect much to happen between the areas (and travellers might have been too much for the N64 to handle). How many areas did it connect? We had the farm, a village, the capital, the forest, the river, the lake and the desert. These zones themselves were connected in various ways so that at some point in the game you could travel between most of them without actually seeing the field connecting them.

In Skyward Sword we have the forest, the desert, the mountains and that stormy cloud which actually is part of the sky but they somehow decided to make it an individual zone, all of them designed basically as levels, existing for themselves.

I mean, they made these design decisions which are fine to make but result in a different feeling. As I am playing Zelda games (not all of them but most of them) since ALttP I expected something else, especially as technology advances (even while considering the weaknesses of the Wii) I expected the world to be more alive and more connected, not less.

So, to put it in a nutshell, I enjoyed the game, the gameplay and the connections between it and TP, but it didn't offer what I consider to be an important part of the ""Zelda-Experience"". "
