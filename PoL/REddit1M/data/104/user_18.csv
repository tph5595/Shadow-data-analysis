12271,"Skyward Sword was easily one of the better Zelda games. Sound track, game play, story, graphics, and dungeons were all top tier. I think people just don't like new stuff. They get caught up in things like Zelda because of nostalgia, so when a new Zelda title comes along, they don't pay it as much attention because it wasn't what they played when they were younger. That's my take on it at least. "
24144,Really? I found the soundtrack to be the best in the franchise. I thought that was its strongest part. 
27803,I guess you seem to know what you're talking about. I just hear that sound track and am amazed by it. 
29947,So Kondos music is more the classic Zelda feel while SS is a newer but less Zelda style of music.
