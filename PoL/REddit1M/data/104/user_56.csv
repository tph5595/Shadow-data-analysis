29486,"Skyward Sword is actually one of my favorite Zelda games. I loved the characters, the art style and the boss fights were amazing. Even the last battle with Girahim all the way to Demise was something else. Plus it's basically the Genesis of the Zelda universe. Oh and the music...ok everything was just great IMO. The motion controls felt good to me, not sure why a lot of people had issues with that?"
