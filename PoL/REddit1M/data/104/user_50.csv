I tried a replay of the game recently and I was wondering ""what's wrong this game is great gameplay is fun design neat, and atmosphere astounding!"" and then I got to the dowsing before the fire temple. Such tedium. Such a momentum killer."

It's like nintendo realized people want a bigger experience but rather than delivering on that by making a bigger world or more dungeons they padded it out by adding the dowsing function."
