55402,"Fi really almost ruined this game for me. I remember walking into a room and there were switches on the wall and I was thinking ""it's going to be 2 3 and then 1"" I took ONE step and Fi started explaining the fucking puzzle to me. LET ME FIGURE IT OUT. Let me ignore her unless I need help. She was always popping up in the middle of exploring or something else to tell me shit, breaking into my gameplay. Fuck off Fi."
