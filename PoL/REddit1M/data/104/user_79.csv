53970,"I thought the motion controls were far easier than Twilight Princess's, of course TP was not designed specifically for Wii. Nonetheless I found the TP controls more *fun* when they were responsive, but extremely aggravating when they weren't (CATCHING A FUCKING FISH FOR FUCK'S FUCK).

I like Skyward Sword overall. I played it way after the hype had gone down, and I'd stayed away from discussions over that time, so I did not even know it was one of the least-appreciated games in the franchise. "
