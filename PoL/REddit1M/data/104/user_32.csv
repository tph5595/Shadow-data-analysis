17894,"I absolutely loved this game, especially playing the boss mini-game for the rewards. Because it HONED my skills like a F* Warrior. I got such a rewarding feeling after beating the game, It was tough, those controls are NOT THE BEST, and it is a really long game, but it was worth it to master.....Also the music was amazing and greatly helped the entire game.
