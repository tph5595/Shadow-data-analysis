10186,Skyward Sword is in my Top 3 Zelda games. It was so great!
64605,"It's funny that you say your SO is letting you play it. My girlfriend is actually the one who owned the game and I played hers and it was what we first bonded over! But it really is a great game. The controls aren't the most responsive sometimes, but I never had nearly as much trouble with them as most people say. Great story, enjoyable characters, great dungeon design, some of the best music in the series. I'm just a huge fan of the game!"
