The controls were amazing both times I played (and beat) the game, Once when it came out and once last year.

I loved the characters. Link felt like he had some sort of personality and/or character development unlike most games (I know he's supposed to be empty so you can attach your personality to him)

Fi was annoying at times but still pretty awesome. 

The only thing I can agree with is how linear and tiny the world is. Other than that it's amazing."
