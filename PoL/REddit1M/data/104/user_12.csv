9152,"There are only three areas, no open world, I hated the birds, no open world, the controls were shotty, no open world, don't like stamina, no open world, poor side quests, *only three areas*, **no open world**, not enough gorons, no open world, it GIVES YOU THE ANSWERS TO EVERY PUZZLE resulting in 0 satisfaction when going through quests, that terrible terrible realm where you have to get those fucking fruits OVER AND OVER AND OVER, no Epona (not so bad, but still), the harp has the least creative controls I've ever seen, FUCKING IMPRISONED, only three world's, no open world. 

By far my least favorite console Zelda and in terms of overall franchise I consider it down on Zelda 2 levels.  They took everything I liked about Zelda and removed it from the game.  It didn't take me across a sprawling realm of danger an intrigue, they took me to a *single* world in the sky that acts effectively as a huge menu for you to select what one of three levels you would like to go to.  If you don't solve a puzzle within period of time that robot GIVES you the answer.  And fuck hints.  No hints written on signs, just explicit instructions.

I didn't even like the creatures introduced.  Those Crash Bandicoot things?  The whole underground crawling mandatory mini game?  Terrible.

Oh, you just beat a world?  How about we now take you BACK to that world, *but this time you're timed and can't damage enemies*.  Oh, haven't had enough?  Let's fill that **same fucking world** with water.  That counts as a separate level, right?  No, it fucking doesn't. 

Look, the game did lots right.  I actually liked Ghirahim.  I liked the art.  I liked a lot of the dungeons.  And the bosses?  The bosses were some of the best in the franchise.

I'm a firm believer that you can't just judge something by all the things it does wrong, but in this case I think the game misses *so much* of the mark it's impossible for me to not view it poorly.  I genuinely enjoyed Spirit Tracks more.

Or a lake.  Or a volcano.  Or a mountain.  You can stumble upon things.  The sky map is utterly empty with *three* beacons.

And, honestly, I'm not hot on Termina either.  MM is far from my favorite game and not one I'd hold as an example of things I enjoy in the franchise. "
