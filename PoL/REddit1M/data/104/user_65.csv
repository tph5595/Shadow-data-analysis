42501,"My ""work with them"" was getting a cheap nunchuck extension cord off Amazon.  
  
I felt like I was constantly going to rip the nunchuck out of the remote with how much swordplay I was trying to do. Ordered one, threaded it through my sleeves and shirt (to keep the cord from smacking me constantly) and wham, free-range 1:1 movement. I felt this is what was intended but not delivered on. If you have the means and are wont to play it again, it changes everything."
