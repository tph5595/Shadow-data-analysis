52218,"I played it for the first time on the Wii console on Wii U and was blown away by how good it was, shot to my favourite zelda game. The motion controls were pretty good for sword fighting I thought, though annoying for flying.

I replayed TP on the Wii U right after it and the motion controls were far more annoying there due to not matching your movement. "
