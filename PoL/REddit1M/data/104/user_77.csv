53048,No because they were uninspired and boring.

I could name you almost all the other bosses from all 3D console Zelda games...but I could name you two in SS, and one of them I can't tell you the name actually I can only say statue thing."

MM got hate because it *wasn't* OoT, but is fantastic in it's own right. People just weren't quite ready for another Zelda game I think. WW got hate because of the graphics. I see two major complaints about Skyward Sword. The first is motion controls, I personally didn't have an issue there so I can't speak for them. The second is *everything else*. Seriously for a Zelda title it was pretty god damn  boring."
