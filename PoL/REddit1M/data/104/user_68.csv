45004,"It's my second favorite 3D Zelda behind Wind Waker, the motion controls made it so that each enemy felt like a small puzzle and it felt hard (while not actually being hard). 

I did have some trouble with the motion controls, sometimes they just didn't work perfectly but it was never game breaking. "
