56380,"&gt;  still hate on Twilight Princess and Wind Waker

IIRC when it came out most Wind Waker hate was, ""What is this cartoon shit? I want something dark a cinematic, like OoT!"" Now the hate is, ""Triforce piece fetch quest? I thought there would be more dungeons!""

Every Zelda has hate, but a lot of people jump on the hate bandwagon early just on a poor first impression."
