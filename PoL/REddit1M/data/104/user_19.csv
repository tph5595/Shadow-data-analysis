12709,The only issue I ever had was with trying to forward thrust and it thinking it was a slash or something. Beamos' were the bane of my existence.
15413,"Honestly, I think I found the bosses of SS to be kind of lacking really. All the Ghirahim fights were great, Koloktos was cool, and Demise was just plain awesome. Other than those they were kinda meh. Twilight Princess continues to have my most favorite boss fights of the series."
15970,"I actually don't remember that boss, which was it? And I don't necessarily rate them by difficulty; the majority of Zelda bosses are pretty easy. But TP's were very aesthetically pleasing and more memorable for me than SS's (which is probably because most of the SS bosses were cartoony blobs that were pretty lame)."
