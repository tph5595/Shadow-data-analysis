And about not having any fighting, I don't get that either. The whole game is filled with good fights and it has some of the best boss fights in the series (that statue boss was my favorite in any Zelda). I mean, most of the AI is really fleshed out and if you just hack and slash your way through you will have a bad time, thus making of each fight a fair amount of challenge until you learn the patterns.

I agree with the exploration bit, literally the worst in the series and the lowest point of the game. But meh, it makes up having the best story and some of the most memorable characters in the franchise."
