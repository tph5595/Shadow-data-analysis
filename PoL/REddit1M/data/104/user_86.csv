56790,"Honestly I was really frustrated with the motion controls until around the 3rd dungeon at which point I felt I had them figured out and from that point I'd only have a few problems with poorly timed misreads (as others have mentioned it was mainly forward thrust that had problems). I feel like most of the people that hated the game for them either didn't give the game enough time to get to that point, or were stuck playing the game like it was TP's terrible motion controls, or just didn't really try the right things (IIRC it was easiest if you made sure you were holding the controller fairly level rather than at an angle like many people do, and if you did most of the motions as a flick of the wrist rather than swinging your whole arm, which I think was a problem many had, especially since swinging your whole arm is less precise and more tiring). Once I had really learned the motion controls I absolutely loved the game, my only real issue was Fi (I hated her hand holding but I would have been able to accept it if she didn't keep pausing the game unskippably for like 10 seconds so often to tell me my battery was running low) and to a lesser extent how easy the game was and how most of the puzzles were pretty simple motion applications."

Chances are if they did remake it the Motion Plus controls would still be an option, but there's so many people who hated the game and never played it on account of the controls that it would make sense to work out a less frustrating control scheme for those people to play too."
