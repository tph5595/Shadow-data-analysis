4827,"I feel people hate on the game because of the motion controls, which 1 to 1 motion controls is something people wanted and were disappointed TP didn't have, too be fair they are unreliable and inconsistent. And the other problem I see people have is the repetitiveness, see Imprisoned and redoing areas. 

SS IMO is great. I'm a very story based person and SS has the best story and characters, IMO of course, in the whole series. I love the story and characters so much that I (almost) always forget about the bad parts of the game. But is there truly a game let alone a Zelda game that doesn't have its flaws. SS is my favorite Zelda game.

Tl;Dr: Bad motion controls, repetitive. SS is Great. 10/10

Edit: Ballad of the Goddess is my Jam."
