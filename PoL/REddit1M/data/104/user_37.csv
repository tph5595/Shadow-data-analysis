19186,"I had a only a couple complaints about SS, but overall it was one of my favorites. 
First of all, as others have mentioned, Fi is a pain in the ass. It would've definitely been better if there were a way to let that bitch know you've been playing Zelda already for 14 GODDAMN YEARS AND YOU DONT NEED HER HELP!!!!
Secondly, while the motion controls seemed to work perfectly for me, the controls for flying the bird seemed kind of tacked on. Wasn't totally U enjoyable there, but it seemed weird. 
And also, while many Zelda games (OoT included) are linear in the sense that there is an order of dungeons you have to follow, this one felt almost TOO linear. I didn't like the fact that hyrule wasn't all connected and you had to fly and jump into the different zones, rather than having a more open world. 
Besides that, it was still a great game, probably even in my top five favorite Zeldas. It was unique, had beautiful artwork, awesome story, fun boss battles and interesting puzzles. In fact, just typing this up is making me wanna go replay it. "
