7774,"&gt; that stupid stamina meter. 

How is the stamina meter stupid?  It added a variety of movement options to the game that wouldn't exist without a stamina meter.  And it allowed the game to be balanced for those options, like making the Silent Realms about resource management in the form of your stamina, and provided another useful potion to the game in the form of an anti-stamina-depletion potion.

&gt;it was super long

That's also a really weird complaint to see about a video game, especially a mainline console Zelda title."
7798,"Okay, but I want motion controls as an option on all the new Zeldas too."
52216,"&gt; 3 zones I need to go to again and again and again. Yes they change a little bit but after all these are the same three zones.

But... you open completely new areas of each zone every time you go back.  And the Song of the Hero quest completely overhauls how each of them functions.

I don't understand this complaint at all.  Yes, Lanayru Sand Sea is a desert, just like the Lanayru Mining Area, but it's a **completely different** location in terms of gameplay.

&gt;zones were levels instead of part of an open and living world

I find a series of disconnected zones that are packed full of stuff to do and things happening in them to feel more ""alive"" than those zones still existing (Zora's River, Death Mountain Trail, etc.) but all connecting to a giant, flat, empty field."
52246,"The Triforce Quest is better in the original, though.  And that's the primary reason I hate the HD version."
52386,"I meant in Zelda U and beyond.  You know, as long as they're doing the extra work to redesign the entirety of Skyward Sword for ""normal controls"" anyway.  ;)"
54527,"&gt; The escort quest part

I'll give you the escort quest (the quest itself is fun but its story setup is idiotic), but the stealth section was awesome because it changed the way you play the game and forced you to use your items in new and unusual combinations, since you got them back in a different order.

Silent Realms were fantastic because they were a high-stress athletic challenge that tested your knowledge of the zone's layout.

&gt;the fetch quest parts

There was only one fetch quest, and it had you backtrack to a dungeon you already cleared that had new enemies and puzzles in it, which is a very good thing.

&gt;fighting the same bosses multiple times

Re-fighting Ghirahim and Moldarach are devices to demonstrate the increase in player skill through the game.  Re-fighting the Imprisoned (first of all, with different mechanics each time) adds an **extremely necessary** sense of urgency to the story.  They don't just tell us that the big bad is coming and can't be stopped, we personally experience that the big bad cannot be stopped.

This is done for much the same reason as the ""tedious"" initial visit to the Forsaken Fortress in Wind Waker (or, depending on which side you're arguing here, the ""pointless"" second visit) - to show the player growth and keep them invested in the world.

&gt;the unnecessary padding parts (Tadtone collecting)

Tadtones were alright, but the ""minidungeon"" to access Lanayru was great.  It was just raw Legend of Zelda puzzle-solving action, and it was late-game so they were all complex, usually timed, and had tons of stuff going on.  Why complain about that?"
59482,"How do you suggest they put them on a regular controller?  I guess you could do a dual-stick thing where the right-stick controls Link's sword arm.  Do you think that would work?

&gt;What a SS remake should fix

Personally, I hope the concept of remakes dies out very, very soon."
59621,"&gt; Pirate Captain in the Sky Keep made no sense

Sky Keep was a challenge custom-built by Hylia (or maybe even the Old Gods) to guard the Triforce.  Whoever built it included demons and constructed each room after one of the Surface's grand temples, so we know all those temples already existed.  When Sky Keep was being built, Lanayru and his bots were certainly already in existence, so the builder commissioned Dreadfuse to act as a guard.

I don't see what doesn't make sense about it."
60239,"VC ports are fine, full-blown remakes are an enormous waste of time.

I never owned a SNES as a kid, that hasn't stopped me from playing the original Super Metroid.  Didn't need a remake of that to allow me to play it.  And now I have a SNES so I can play other SNES games."
