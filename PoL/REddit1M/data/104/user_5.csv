6878,"I agree. Skyward Sword is a good game. I won't say great because the gameplay obviously plays a role in the overall experience. 

The story was great, the design was great and the music was good. I can't tell you how many manly tears were shed when Zelda sealed herself in the Crystal, or even when Fi said goodbye, even though she's technically always with us. The story was captivating and engaging, constantly giving us the need to find Zelda. 

What also bogged the game down for me was the lack of exploration in the main world. The sky had some decent stuff, but I was hoping for more out of the lower lands. 

Just my two cents."

But the story and music are still good."
