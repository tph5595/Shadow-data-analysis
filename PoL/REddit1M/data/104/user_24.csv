I enjoyed it, but was very disappointed. Zelda games are a cut above the rest, so I have to compare it against other Zelda games. In that context, it ranked low.

But that is besides the point. Awesome treasure chest! I usually keep a box to hold all my loose change. That chest would be cool to use for that."
