43160,"Skyward Sword is still one of my favorite Zelda's story wise. Plus, I just loved Ghirahim. Sure, you fought him and the Imprisoned multiple times, but it didn't really hurt the game that much. As for the controls, yea, they could be wonky at first, but once you got used to them, it was fine. Overall, its not as bad of a game as people make it out to be. "
