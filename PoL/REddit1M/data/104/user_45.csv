22505,"A game being too long is a legitimate complaint, much like how a book being too long or a movie or a game of monopoly. Content/pacing/length is an important aspect to game design. 

Never played more than 2 hours of Skyward Sword, so I can't say if it was too long. I'm just talking in general here. The best Zelda example I know of is the Triforce Pieces in Wind Waker. The content didn't match the length of the segment, and it broke the pace of the game, so it made the game longer than it should have been. That's why they changed it in the HD revision. ;) "
