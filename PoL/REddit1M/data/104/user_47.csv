23332,"Skyward Sword is noteworthy in the franchise thanks to its huge effects on the lore of the series.  When it comes to plot and the mythology of the series itself, the game was a huge step forward for the franchise, giving the series a much wider scope which will undoubtedly have a huge influence on games to come.  I don't think there was such a huge game in the series since Ocarina of Time.

Having said that, the game itself suffers a bit when it comes to gameplay.  It shed the really solid swordplay developed by WindWaker and Twilight Princess (Gamecube version) for motion controls that were rather temperamental.  The overworld was sparse, while the underworld was for the most part uninteresting and unvaried, and the game was rather linear.  The recycled areas really made the game seem repetitive, and the amount of padding on the game is rather ridiculous.

There was some good additions in the gameplay, though.  I really liked the breakable shields and upgradeable weapons, it really gave you a reason to collect items and rupees, which has honestly been somewhat of a problem for the majority of the series.  I wish they would expand on these aspects in future games.  The dungeon design was particularly superb, especially due to the fact that they veered off the standard themes that they tended to follow.  And the bosses were an absolute blast.  

Skyward Sword is, by all accounts, a poor game in the franchise itself, but I think that overall the additions that it gave to the franchise are greater than anything that we have seen in recent years.  The Zelda series, more than any other Nintendo franchise, had become incredibly stale in recent years (honestly, everything until recently have been variations of the formula established by LttP/OoT), and it needed a rather significant shake up in order to keep it fresh.  This was Nintendo's first real attempt to bring Zelda into the 21st century, and while it didn't pan out as they planned, it does show huge potential.  I am excited for the next Zelda title because of this."
