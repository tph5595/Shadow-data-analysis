61107,"I never had any trouble, I actually really enjoyed the motion controls in Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword. (*Even though I'm left handed and links sword was on the wrong side dammit!*)

I thought Skyward Sword was great.       
It loses a couple points for repetitive elements and a sparse sky area that didn't let you utilize the flight mechanic nearly as much as they should have.      
But overall I loved it.  Especially towards the end.   
I think things really pick up in the second half of the story.    "
