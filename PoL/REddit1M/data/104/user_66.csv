Flying around Skyward Sword's overworld, you find barren rocks. They literally have nothing to offer unless you've already found a map telling you there's a chest there.

Wind Waker was dull on long trips late in the game, and it's still my favourite of the series. Skyward Sword had motion controls fighting me all game, and I was so bored exploring that I'm not sure why I fought past them."
