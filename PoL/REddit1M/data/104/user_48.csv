They're not, they're using a controller to move a character on a game. I absolutely loved the motion controls and had very few issues with them. Now I want to play Skyward Sword again."

The DLC is amazing, it's where I've put probably 85% of my time into the game. Definitely worth it in my opinion. Almost all my characters are over 100, with Link and Ganondorf at max level (255)."
