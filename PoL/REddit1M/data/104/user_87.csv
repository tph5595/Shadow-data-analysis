57269,"I agree. Everything felt so dead to me. Even the forest area with all those little creatures really didn't feel alive to me, maybe because they always stayed in the same place and didn't do anything unless you talked to them. "
57706,"I really liked the motion controls actually. But overall I did not enjoy the game. Extremely linear, the world felt dead (except for skyloft, none of the areas truly had a living ecosystem, just things walking in circles and doing nothing), fking Fi being the most annoying companion of all time, and all the revisiting of areas you've already been to over and over again. 
Didn't care for the Silent Realm either, although it's probably the only non-cutscene part of the game that made me feel anything (mostly horrible anxiety). 

I've kept all my old copies of Zelda games, but Skyward Sword is the only one I sold because I know I won't play it again... "
