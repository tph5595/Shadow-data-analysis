52407,"&gt; All the Ghirahim fights were great

I hated the first Ghirahim fight because it depended on attack styles that were not taught to you and were inappropriately unintuitive at that point in the game.  Hold the sword to the right, then move it to the left quickly, but not so quickly as to be registered as a strike, and then slash left-to-right to take advantage of his weak side?  Nuts to that."
52500,Silent realm was awesome once.  It was not awesome four times.
53128,"&gt; That's also a really weird complaint to see about a video game, especially a mainline console Zelda title.

Eh, it's a valid complaint if player thinks that the length doesn't add value to the game.  I loved a huge chunk of Skyward Sword, but I found that on my second playthrough, I noticed that the game really just stopped trying halfway through and started checking off every single lazy RPG trope out there.

The escort quest part, the forced stealth/collect your gear part, the powerless part (once was fine.  Four times was annoying), the fetch quest parts, fighting the same bosses multiple times, the unnecessary padding parts (Tadtone collecting), all of that contributed to parts of the game that I did not find enjoyable.

Skyward Sword is a good game with incredible highs, but its lows are frustrating and confounding.  "
55992,"I'm not saying there's no internal logic to the inclusion of those parts* **, and if you enjoyed those parts, then that's totally cool.  I'm just saying that I didn't enjoy them because even if you think they add value to the story, I still find that they represent a lazy paint-by-numbers approach to game content, and that bothered me because I have higher expectations of Zelda games.  I expect Nintendo to be more creative than to mine the depths of the the RPG trope handbook, which they did in spades.

Also, there were multiple fetch objectives - that is, times where you have to stop what you're doing to go and find a thing in order to proceed, and the only purpose of having you find the thing is to delay your progression through the game - the scattered keys to get into the Earth Temple, the water to get into the Fire Sanctuary, the pinwheels to turn the statues on Skyloft, etc.  I found that it interrupted the flow of the game significantly.

*there is zero internal logic to the inclusion of the escort quest whatsoever and it is easily the worst part of the game.

**Pirate Captain in the Sky Keep made no sense"
61777,"Honestly, that sounds like a bit of post-hoc rationalization.  If they were going for any sense of narrative or thematic consistency, then you would think that the enemy would be placed in the areas modeled after the Sandship/Lanayru Mining Facility which is the type of environment where the Pirate Captain is found, not the area modeled after the underground bit from the Ancient Cistern.

The game is massive.  There's an enormous amount of unique content.  They could have put any number of enemies in there, or they could have developed a new mini-boss, but instead they just reskinned the Pirate Captain, and the battle plays out literally identically to how it did on the Sandship.  Exact same type of arena, exact same attack patterns, nothing new about the environment, anything like that.  You aren't practicably stronger in this battle - you do the same thing the same number of times that you did on the Sandship.  They did literally nothing new with the battle, unlike, say, when you have to fight the Stalmaster with the other cursed Bokoblins around, or when you have to fight two metal-shield Moblins at once instead of one.  

The way it plays out in the game is logically inconsistent at best and straight-up lazy at worst.  This is just straight CTRL+C, CTRL+V.  It's totally fine if you like it, but you at least have to admit that they did *nothing* to make this battle different than it was on the Sandship, and that the area he was guarding had no link to the Pirate Captain at all."
