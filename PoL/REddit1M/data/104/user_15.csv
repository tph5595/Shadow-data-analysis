9785,"&gt;How is the stamina meter stupid?

I just hate the meter itself.  That shit goes in the otherwise least-used corners of the screen for a reason.  I'd be much happier with a meterless sprint where you just get a feel for how much you can run, like a lot of other games do.

I also hated the little stamina pickups that littered the map.  Felt way too close to Mario or Banjo Kazooie or something.  Some kind of 'speed mode' is almost essential at this point but I just don't like how Nintendo did it in SS aside from the actual action."
23702,"It doesn't have to show up when you're not using it, nor does it have to show up in the center of the screen, fully opaque.  It's not like you need to be looking at it constantly to know when you'll run out, either.  It's not *that* specific.

Even at that, it doesn't have to be a meter.  Lots of games just use a vignette, sound effect, slowdown, etc when you're starting to run out of juice.  Stamina isn't a gas gauge but even if it's treated that way, gas gauges don't need to be glued to the center of the windshield.  Sorry, your preferences aren't any worse than mine, I just don't like HUD clutter."
26146,"&gt;And I don't like my game doing wonky color changes or being unplayable on mute simply because some buy somewhere doesn't feel it's important to know how much stamina he has.

Nobody said anything about color changes, that's not what a vignette is, and if it's unplayable on mute just because of that, then Zelda already is unplayable on mute because it uses tons of sound effects to signify things.  Unsteady the camera a bit, or change Link's animation as he begins to run out.  It pretty much already does that, just not before you're already out.  Super simple stuff, good for visuals, way better than excessive HUD in the middle of the screen.  

&gt;It wasn't that intrusive

Maybe not for you, but it was to me, and I think you'll find that sort of thing to be a common trend what with all the minimal-HUD mods for various games sitting at 500k downloads.  I want to look at the game showing off its pretty artwork, not a bunch of gauges and meters.

&gt;Were there times when that was useful? Yes.

I suppose, but I don't think it really felt *that* much more specific anyway.  It's a negligible difference to me, and too much HUD gets on my nerves way more than the occasional slightly misjudged stamina."
26491,"Skyward Sword isn't really new, people still hate on Twilight Princess and Wind Waker, and ALBW was loved at release.  Everybody's opinion isn't going to just suddenly change.  You'll see hate for pretty much any Zelda game there is, and it's only because people like different things."
27559,"I mean, anybody can like what they like, but from a technical standpoint it was somewhat... generic, and simple relative to prior entries.

Yeah, it had nice big movie-esque (partial) orchestra, and that's good in its own way, but that's not what made Zelda's music so famous.  It's remembered for its catchy and memorable employment of quirky techniques and cultural themes, unique atmosphere, perfect alignment between setting and music, capturing the feel of an authentic medieval world combined with cartoony fantasy, etc. Koji Kondo is renowned in the videogame music scene because of how fun, distinct and stylized his music is, and to musicians he's loved for his masterful and unique method of composing.  

Skyward Sword's OST is good... but it's not those things.  I think to a musician, it's *painfully* obvious that Kondo is no longer as involved as he used to be.  I like the feel of a big, epic (*partially*) orchestrated soundtrack, but the music behind it just isn't in league with what Kondo does."
28343,"Not to say I don't really like it, or anything.  Skyloft alone is one of my favorite songs from the series.  I like that kind of music, but it doesn't impress me nearly as much as Kondo's, and it doesn't exactly scream ""Zelda!"" to me.  It's good, but Kondo is his own sort of timeless thing.

I guess you could say Skyward Sword's music is very conventional and modern, while Kondo's Zelda is anything but that."
29560,"It's artificial, used to push a moot point to enforce an opinion.  Every Zelda game is loved and hated by different people.  Ocarina of Time was adored on release, and mostly still is, but some people still hate on it as you can see on this sub.  Majora's Mask still has people turned off by its day cycles, but others still think its the best in the series.  Wind Waker was only ever *hated* on by kids who need a 'macho' art style, and its reputation has barely budged since then and the HD release.  Twilight Princess was and still is one of the most widely-favored Zelda games.  Skyward Sword has been harshly divided since release, and nothing has changed.

You really think everyone is going to hate Zelda U and start loving Skyward Sword when it comes out?  Based on some infallible, imaginary cycle that somehow dictates all opinions?  You're kidding yourself.  Literally everything is better in hindsight, but that's *everything.*  It doesn't mean any given Zelda game is going to suddenly explode into acclaim that it didn't originally have.  I've been around for every release since ALTTP; things have *hardly* changed, and the only game this is *sort of* true for is Majora's Mask, but even that only ever reached 'cult classic' status."
30932,"Yeah, pretty much.  They just follow very different methods.  Kondo's is a much more culture and history based sort of thing, making use of a lot of concepts you'd see in classical music, or distinctly Eastern or Latin.  Or maybe, something way out there and totally strange, like the alien music or the Great Bay Temple.

Skyward Sword's composers followed a more straight forward approach, instead tapping into things like emotion and underscoring to follow the expanded cinematics.  One is more about the theme, while the other is more about the scene.

Neither is necessarily worse than the other, I just prefer the less contemporary/conventional method.  It's what Zelda sounds like to me, and what got me interested in music in the first place."
78706,"Yeah, same for me.  I really hope Zelda U takes some cues from the prior games in those aspects.  I'll be heavily disappointed if I enter all the dungeons and only hear basic ambient underscoring.  I want to hear something like the Forest, Great Bay or Stone Tower Temple again. "
