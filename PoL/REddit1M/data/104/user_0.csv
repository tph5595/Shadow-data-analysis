3577,"Are you talking terrible story, terrible motion controls, terrible characters? What specifically about it did you hate?"
3874,"Here it is when you open it up.

8062,"&gt;I'm usually more of an ass man ;)

Obviously you haven't played enough Hyrule Warriors"
16806,"Yeah, it did not want to fit in there for sure.  I actually had a lot of trouble just getting Scervo's sword out of the clamshell too.  I actually ended up breaking the fingers from the hilt and had to glue them back on.  It was a bitch to get that thing out."
16895,"If you're interested, I could definitely make one for you.  PM me."
17877,I'm in the same boat.  I have the entire series of Fire Emblem that I bought after I played Awakening.  And Fates comes out in a few weeks too.  Hyrule Warriors is actually a lot of fun when you get to adventure mode.
17945,It would literally be a treasure chest!
18675,"I liked Fi.  

(Ready for the downvotes)"
18866,You sure you're talking about SS?  I don't remember Ganondorf being in that one.
20429,"I agree, by far the best story of them all."
23646,"I don't think I've put that many hours into it, but I've definitely out in some time.  Does the rupee glitch trick still work?  Most of my characters are around lvl 45, with Link being around 80.  Is the DLC worth it?"
24132,"I wonder how much of an impact the limitations of the Wii console had on the game.  I mean it was only a slightly more powerful GameCube, so it couldn't really generate a large workable area that maintained the detail that it did.  I honestly think that we (as a community) might be a little too critical, because we've gotten used to what the latest generation of consoles can do.  That's why I'm really excited for the next installment.  I hope that it incorporates a lot of the elements that The Witcher 3 did.  If they keep it open world, with upgradable equipment, and make it so you actually need rupees for something other than potions later in the game, then this could be one of the best games Nintendo will have ever made."

If you look in my submitted history there is a work in progress of a previous chest that I worked on.  The title post is ""earlier this year I took a yard sale trinket....""

If you are thinking about trying your hand at making one, I'd gladly give you any advice or instructions that you might find helpful.  Even with step my step instructions it's still kind of a chore until you get to the end and its done."
62670,Neither do you
70725,"&gt;all the merchandise

There is literally 2 figures that Dark Horse/F4F made and one Figma.  I can't even wrap my head around all the stuff that came out for Majora's Mask.  Not to mention that ALBW, MM, and TFH got ENTIRE FUCKING CONSOLES released for them."
81129,"MM has the Skull Kid Figurine, the pin, puzzles, posters and a Nendoroid.  WW has the Ganondorf Figurine and an already released Nendoroid as well plus a few puzzles .  TP has a F4F Wolf Link and Midna that blows my mind how awesome it isas well as a full size Zelda, along with the Dark Horse Link and Ganondorf.  Ocarina has a handful of figures and two F4F statutes.

Of all the major releases SS definitely has the smallest amount of merchandise available for it."
