2573,"I like SS, just hated the forcing of motion controls. I hope when it gets its eventual remake theyll let us play with normal controls"
8271,Considering that it's the original control scheme I would assume they'd be available. I just want the option to use a normal controller.
10380,Very true. The motion is ok for flying the beetle and a few other things but i really would have liked standard controls for fighting. So far im enjoying everything else about SS. (doing a Zelda marathon and this is one of the only ones I've never played...never owned a wii)
58965,It would be far from impossible. You can easily map the different sword swings to button commands. Or you can have the second joystick be the sword control since there's no camera control in SS.
59127,"They wouldn't have to redesign anything, just put the controls to work for a regular controller, which would not be difficult at all.

What a SS remake should fix up is lessen how often Fi interrupts you, and remove the whole notification every time you pick up a bug or craftable item. "
60019,"Someone in the PC community mapped all of SS's controls to a regular controller on a Wii emulator and it worked just fine. This is what makes me believe the game doesn't have to be altered at all for a regular control scheme.

As for remakes, I'm not usually a fan, especially when they decide to change huge aspects of them ( looking at you FFVII, how dare you remove turn based combat) but the Legend of Zelda is mt favorite game series and I love that they're putting out older games on newer consoles. I never owned a Gamecube or Wii as a kid so the HD remakes of WW and TP finally let me play those games. Same goes for the really old games. I don't own a NES or old Gameboy anymore, but with the 3DS I can play all of those LoZ games.
