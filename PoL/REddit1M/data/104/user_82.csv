56345,"My issue with the game were the standards. Didn't feel open, tough motion control, repetitive, Fi was annoying blah blah blah.  What really turned me off was that stamina meter. It just didn't work for me personally.  I played though it twice and I don't see myself revisiting unfortunately unless its just to look at it and listen to the most amazing music."
