14943,The game definitely had the best collection of dungeons but I found the soundtrack to be less memorable than the likes of Wind Waker and Ocarina of Time.
15051,"I thought the Moldarach fight was kind of lame and boring, they even reused him as a mini boss later on."
15412,"Thank god I'm not the only one, that fight and the one versus Tentalus where you had to do a horizontal strike felt like a boss fight versus the controller more than anything."
15546,You do realize Twilight Princess has a boss that doesn't attack you? Aesthetically the bosses were great but they were all complete jokes in terms of difficulty.
16076,"Morpheel, literally just swims around. I do agree with you that aesthetically Twilight Princess' are the best but they were so easy that it really diminished the effect of a *boss battle*. Not every boss needs to be Ornstein and Smough but I don't think Twilight Princess did a good job with the difficulty at all."
17947,I'm still not convinced that hero mode will do anything for Morpheel because that would require he attack in the first place.
66295,OP asked for it by putting *Skyward Sword still doesn't get enough love*.
68530,The only thing memorable to me was the 6/4 syncopated ostinato in Faron Woods. 
68670,I love analyzing video games OSTs especially the Legend of Zelda ones but I hardly even gave Skyward Sword's a second glance. =\
