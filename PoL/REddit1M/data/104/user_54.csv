28013,"It all depends on your set up and sensor bar distance I think. That and it ISNT based on huge wild swings, but instead reasonable, sensitive, subtle movements with the wrist. People bitch about it sucking but then I see them swinging the remote around like a freaking tennis racket or something. ""GAMES BROKEN BRO HATE THIS SHIT"""
28117,"TP is WAY too easy and simplified, hence the boss that doesn't even attack you at all. Sure it's visually epic and cool, but the simplistic mechanics and low boss health made really took the game down a notch for me."
28215,The hate cycle is real. SS is in fact the newest main series console game.
28325,"This exactly, it was all about subtle wrist movements, not actually swinging a goddamn sword. "
28415,Do you even goat herd bro? TP's tutorial was WAY more fucking tedious. Prove to little children you can use a slingshot. Now prove to them you can use a sword! Heard some goats TWICE.
28474,Didn't visit Thunderhead or the different sky island sidequests then?
28516,"That would be impossible, most enemies are motion based puzzles. Fucking love that shit. Never remake it with stupid gamecube controls."
28660,Love affair? Not even close. It had mediocre scores throughout and was notoriously and irrationally shat on by people with no patience for subtle motion controls.
