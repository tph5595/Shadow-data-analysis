Fi never stops telling you about items you have picked up a thousand times before.

The game takes roughly an hour and a half to get to non-tutorial gameplay when starting a file.

The game REQUIRES you to watch a safety video on the correct use of the Wii wrist strap in order to play it for the very first time.

The gameplay is severely hindered by the motion-control gimmick.

I thought Skyward Sword wasn't just the weakest of the 3D Zelda games, it was a bad game overall.

The one thing I think this game did right was the way it portrayed Zelda.  It made her very likable, and made you want to save her as badly as Link did.  Other than that, there wasn't anything in this game I thought was worth salvaging."

Also Twilight Princess did eventually get out of the tutorial.  Midna was likable and, in a strangely likable way, she was the least helpful companion.  Twilight Princess did have faults, but as a whole, I will always consider it to be a much, much better game than Skyward Sword."
