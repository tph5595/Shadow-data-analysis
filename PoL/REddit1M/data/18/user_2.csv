1164,"How does everyone feel about the rune system? 

I'm not negative on it, but it does feel a little disjointed. Bombs, Stasis, Magnesis, Cryosis. 

What would you add? Is there anything to add?"
3722,"I think that's about my opinion.

If they did a sequel to Breath of the Wild, would it just feel like Nintendo trying to capture lightning in a bottle?"
83957,"It would be a cool reward for completing all shrines and side quests, in my opinion. Give people a bit of a boost to find the koroks.

I'm tempted to look for them myself, but I have a few trips this year with long flights, so I'll probably just pack my strategy guide with the korok map and knock them out then."
84102,"I would have to agree. I used stop time pretty frequently, and tried to use magnesis to do damage. I always forgot to use cryosis on water. In my 90 hours I wish I would've used it more.

One rune that I'm actually torn on is a rune that would give you a weapon or a shield. It would have some unique property, and a limited time use. Would be a cool Hyrule castle unlock...

I can't feel too negative about it though, they really accomplished creating a world where you see a ton of possibilities. I'm excited for the story expansion (A few people have started to think that its a prequel-style dungeon/story) and even more excited to hear if they are going to do a second game with the same engine.

I do wish that Cryosis had some sort of additional function. It felt a bit odd in the world outside of puzzles."
85288,"If they had big dungeons, I think people would be criticizing the ""point"" of the open world if they just pulled you out of it for hours at a time. Instead they broke up the dungeons across the world, and integrated them into the exploration.

It would've worked a lot better if all of the Divine Beasts were on the level of the Gerudo dungeon, as far as difficulty goes. The Rito area is extremely underwhelming, I haven't met anyone who was impressed with it. 

Even the Goron area lacked a bit of flare to it. "
