21253,"Has the triforce ever shown that type of power though? In the past you literally had to make a (verbal?) wish while actually touching the triforce and after that there was no crazy golden glow or anything, it usually just happened. In this though it definitely looks more like hylia's powers that have been shown in other games, like when Zelda seals Ganon in OoT, or when she summons the light arrows in TP. "
21367,"I would've liked a hookshot-esque style rune, maybe a magnesis+ type of deal. Would've made some climbing areas alot less tedious"
21486,"I felt that was kind of the point though. Like shrines were meant to be abunch of individual small puzzles, while the dungeons were meant to feel like one big mechanic. Idk, to me it just seemed like that's what they were going for."
21560,Wait there are new lynels? Are the harder??? I haven't even noticed.
21691,"Well that's the point of the shrines. They could put in tons of puzzles without having to restrict them to matching the themes of the dungeons. I just wish there were more bosses in the game, the lack of dungeons resulted in a lack of bosses as well."
21863,"My first visit was just to check it out, and if one thing really stuck with me, it was thinking ""wow, this music is an actual masterpiece"". I just couldn't help having the atmosphere be driven by the music, and it was completely worth it. The darkness, the adventure, and the slight nostalgia all in the music alone just really hit home for me"
22806,"I agree for the most part, there's just one area that still bugs me about the game, and it's the variability of enemies. I think they really fell through on different enemy types for the most part. Absolutely HUGE world, full of these charming and unique areas, yet the enemies are basically the exact same all across the map. I just would've liked to see this huge world populated by more than just 10 Hinoxes or Lynels, and it's not like they were short on things they could've included. StalLords, skulltullas, darknuts, wolfos, and who knows, maybe even some of the old bosses/mini bosses could've showed up as world bosses. 

I don't want to make it sound like I'm dissapointed there weren't more previous Zelda enemies in it, because I'm not. It's the lack of different enemies in general that bummed me out. "
23276,"True, but it wouldn't be the first time power has manifested itself in the form of the triforce. Ganondorfs transformation in OoT had the triforce pulsing but in reality it didn't have to do with the triforce, it was just his dark powers."
