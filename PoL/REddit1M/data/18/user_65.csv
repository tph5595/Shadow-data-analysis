It would be cool if other ancient enemies or the Yiga used the runes. Getting in a magnesis fight would be cool. So would enemies who time stop your arrows in place, or quickly grow ice blocks between you and them to block your sword attacks.

If more people used all those powers, it would have felt more natural in the game."
