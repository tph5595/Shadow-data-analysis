64066,"A bunch of different variations on the same kinds of enemies are exactly what people are complaining about when it comes to enemy variety. Most of the bosses are either recolored Hinoxes, Lynels, Talus or Stal versions of them (except Talus is just made of differint kinds of rock). Most of the regular enemies are Keese, Lizalfos, Moblins and Bokoblins, or recolored/stal versions of them."
