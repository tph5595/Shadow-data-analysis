26842,"I think it's the combination of Link's relationship to Mipha, the on-the-nose racism (inclining the player to prove them wrong), the character Sidon, people liking Zoras a lot in general and the fact that Vah Ruta poses a pretty respectable and creative threat (my personal moment with this was that when going through Lanayru at some point I noticed it never stopped raining, and before I went to zora's domain I wound up at east reservoir lake and had the epiphany that this *thing* is responsible for the downtorrents, then got the whole story when I did get to the domain). That entire part of the game is substantially fleshed out, so I can see why people favor that.

I liked each of the divine beasts and the surrounding main quests on their own a lot, but that being said the Gerudo stuff is unquestionably my favorite (my playthrough order was ruta -&gt; medoh -&gt; nabooris -&gt; rudania btw). I felt like Vah Rudania was a bit too washed out and impersonal - Daruk could have been characterized as a more significant figure for the Goron people that is dearly missed similar to Darmani in MM (or even Mipha in the same game).
