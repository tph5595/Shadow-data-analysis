22779,"Where are elemental sword locations that respawn during a blood moon?

All I've found is 2 copies of the flame greatsword (at the maze near the akala lab and the other at that giant tree stump in hyrule field)

I'd love to know the ice and lightning versions tho so I can farm them each blood moon

Thanks if anyone has the answer."
