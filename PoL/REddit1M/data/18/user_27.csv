22650,Anyone else dissapointed in the lack of enemy diversity? I think theres only like 9 different enemys
25076,not counting the different types theres not too much diversity
28095,"bokoblins, moblins, lizalfos, wizzrobes, lynels, chus, keese, octoroks, guardians, yiga,  little stone guys, stone talus, hinox, molduga and bokos mob lizalfos hinox skeleton counterparts. i dont think thats 40. For a game this big i expected more unique like those birds from wind waker in the rito area or darknuts in hyrule castle"
31244,i think it counts the different variants of enemies as seperate things. For example a red haired lynel and a white haired lynel are two seperate pictures
32611,all good brotha :)
39699,i wasnt thinking about that but thats pretty cool. i was thinking in the sense of traditional enemies
