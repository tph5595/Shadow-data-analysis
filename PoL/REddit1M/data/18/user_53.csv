44799,"I feel exactly the same with that order. The buildup to the beast was really weird. All you had to do was fly straight to the guy then shoot 5 easy targets. At least flying *to* the beast was cool. 


Anyway I finally just did hyrule castle and Ganon, and that was cool as shit. Hyrule castle was awesome, it would've been cool as a more traditional dungeon. But it was still great, it felt huge and it had a ton of secret areas.  And Ganon looked so cool. Both forms. His last form was massive. The fight was incredibly easy, but I also have max armor and hearts. "
44951,"The gerudo was really cool and the yiga clan boss was hilarious. That whole area was really fun, maybe the funnest. But the zora one was cool because you actually had a history with those people, and some recognized. Then you find ou about how mipha fely about you and shit.."
45439,"What's the other ending? Or is this more like extra, additional ending?"
45697,"To an extent, I agree. I loved it, and played a LOT, but I did feel like it was starting to drag a little towards the end (probably cus I wanted to max my shit before I fought Ganon). 


I can see myself replaying it some day, but I can't see myself replaying it like I replay other Zelda games. I play OOT at least once every year. 



I'm curious to see what the DLC is though. "
