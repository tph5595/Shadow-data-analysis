24871,"The compendium has room for 161 monsters. Removing three that you can't kill and the four mini bosses, that leaves 154. Supposing that all monsters have four versions (either normal/fire/elec/ice or red/blue/black/silver), that leaves almost 40 different monster types.

EDIT: My math is wrong: The compendium is numbered throughout; the monsters portion starts at 84. So 161-83 is 78, meaning about 18 types. My mistake."
27395,What do you mean? Is 40+ different monsters not diverse?
30963,"Forgive me; I haven't completed the Monster portion of the compendium, so I can't actually see the different monsters it expects you to capture. Is there anything wrong with my math above, or does the monster portion of the compendium include more things that aren't enemies besides the dragons?

EDIT: I figured out where my math is wrong: The compendium is numbered throughout; the monsters portion starts at 84. So 161-83 is 78, meaning about 18 types. My mistake."

31682,"I accounted for that, where I divided by 4. However, my initial number of 161 was wrong; the Monsters portion of the compendium starts at 84. This means about 71 total monsters (excluding dragons and bosses), most of which have 4 types, coming out to 18 - much less than 40. Sorry for the misinformation."
