73002,"My take on Zelda not aging is that when she unlocked her powers (or at least from the moment she decided to fully use them to face Ganon) she temporarily ascended into some kind of immortal spirit form, or incarnation of Hylia. Notice how she can hear Fi talking (as Fi was a creation of Hylia herself) after unlocking her power in the final memory.
I also noticed how she doesn't actually seem to have a physical body in the present until after she comes out once you've defeated dark beast Ganon, and even then she looks otherworldly until she seals him away.

Also, in the true ending, she talks about how she can no longer hear the voice in the sword. Presumably, having served her purpose, she's lost her goddess-like power and will continue aging normally from now on.


As for Zelda's initial resentment for Link, the way I interpreted it (from some of the scenes in the game, particularly the earlier memories) is that Link appears to Zelda as somewhat incompetent and she isn't quite sure why the Master Sword chose him. He comes across to her as this somewhat aloof young guy who barely even says a word and inexplicably has this legendary sword on his back, despite not having yet proven his worth.

To top this off, she's spent her entire life training and praying, trying to unlock the power of her predecessors, despite not particularly wanting to and being scolded by her father the whole way. But she has nothing to show for it, and here comes this young boy who barely says a word, doesn't seem to have put in much effort, but seems to have just been gifted this great task based on little more than natural talent.

As the story progresses, Zelda notices Link's commitment to training (in the memory where it's raining by the Lake Hylia Bridge), he shows far more courage than she anticipated, and he ends up saving her life from the Yiga attack. I felt that her outlook on him changed significantly after that."
