If you played with infinite stamina, it's likely that the game wasn't meant for you."
42565,"Almost everything you consider wasting time is simply part of the game. For example, you claim to have wasted 10 hours covering ground, but exploring the world is basically the point of the game. If you don't like exploring, you won't like the game.

You could also mod to give yourself infinite arrows, no rune recharge, etc. but that would sort of ruin the game for me. Strategizing around your limitations is a key part of the game. If you don't like it, the game's probably not for you, and no mods can change that.

Also you couldn't run *at all* in most previous Zelda games, so walking for 1.5 seconds between sprints wasn't an issue for me."
