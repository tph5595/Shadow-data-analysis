But Im finally having real fun again after 25 hours or so.
I only spoiled myself the great plateu, and breezed through that. I really enjoyed the first 4-6 hours off the plateu. And then it started fading the wold to me felt rather empty and soulless in a lot of places. Like seeing the fox spawn a million times.
But today it finally clicked, I went to the Zora dungeon, I knew where I wanted to go what I had to do, I somehow didnt mind the long streches of nearly nothing anymore, I enjoyed the view and my stay in the game. Fught a nice miniboss and a real boss.
Only thing that still bothers me is the lack of enemy diversity."

I still think a map that would be like 25% smaller would have made for a better expience but oh well."
