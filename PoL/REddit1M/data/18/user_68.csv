61992,"I finished the game today and I was left feeling really disappointed when the final cutscene just brings you back to the main menu and then back to an auto save right before the final battle. I loved the ending without a doubt, I just really wanted to see more of what all that hard work I put into the game actually did and how it affected Hyrule. I know Zelda games previously haven't given you an option to continue a game after beating it, but I was REALLY hoping this one would be different. It wasn't even something I have necessarily wanted in the past, but I specifically thought to myself as I was approaching Hyrule Castle ""man, I really hope all this goo and all these guardians are gone once I beat this that way I can just freely explore this area and the castle to my hearts content."" I wasn't really expecting anything crazy like adventuring with Zelda or anything, I just wanted to see how the world would change once it was free of the calamity and I wanted to be able to experience some real peace and leisure without having a mild heart attack every time a guardian locks onto me. It's not like it ruined the game for me or anything, it's just something I kind of came to anticipate based on how all your actions impacted Hyrule up until that point. "
