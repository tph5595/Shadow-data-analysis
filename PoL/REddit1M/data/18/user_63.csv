55313,"After finishing the game, some thoughts:

• This is a sad story.  This was the tale of losing everything, and then losing your memories, and then finding out that you lost everything before finally getting an incredibly bittersweet end.
• This game needed more ending.
• As much as it was refreshing abandoning Zelda tropes, there should have been a little more inclusion of them.
• As much as I enjoyed the ambient piano throughout the game, I'm on the fence about the sudden inclusion of classic Zelda tunes throughout Hyrule Castle and Ending.  It was refreshing and triumphant on one hand, but on the other where was it through the game?
• All of the Divine Beast dungeons were neat, and creative.  
• There should be 60 less shrines. 120 is tedious.  
• Korok seeds are tedious too.  On the flip side though, YA-HA-HA!
• Equipment degradation was enjoyably balanced however a degradation meter would've been nice.
• World exploration was a blast.  All of it. Scaling walls, paragliding, balancing hot and cold — a blast.
• The game is gorgeous, and it's impressive how much graphical finesse Nintendo can squeeze out of low graphic output.  
• Armor was greatly done, however the amiibo sets should be tweaked up enough to be viable.  
• Dark Link outfit not being upgradable is a damn travesty.
• The Master Sword and Hylian Shield not turning to dark when you wear the Dark Link set is a travesty.
• Horse taming was a great idea, even if I always walked.  
• Fuck the range guardians have, and especially fuck the timing in deflecting a laser.

Those shrines are 10k years old, so we're 100 years past an apocalypse event that was 10k years past the last ganon event.  "
