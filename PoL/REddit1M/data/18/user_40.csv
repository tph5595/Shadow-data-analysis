33542,"No way this game deserves a perfect score.  It's a compelling game for sure, but I feel like I straight up wasted at least 10 hours that I spent playing it just trying to cover ground.  Night cycle enemies suck (got knocked off a mountain climb because a skeleton spawned right underneath me), rain sucks, thunderstorms serve only as a pause to remove metal equipment delay, and I'm not a big fan of the blood moon system.  The stamina system (which I used a trainer to remove) just makes it to where you're watching a green circle for most of the game.  Weapons are way too fragile and the inventory space is far too limited (especially considering your materials inventory space is unlimited).  It just seems to me that there are an awful lot of elephants that are being universally ignored by reviewers."
41254,"Fair enough. I would rather have refinement of something good than introducing unwelcome features (didn't like motion controls in Skyward Sword either).  Obviously ""unwelcome"" is subjective, but that's the nature of opinions I guess.  I also tend not to like open world games where the main discussion point is how massive it is, but I can see how that would appeal to others.  For me Xenoblade Chronicles hit the sweet spot in having a big world that was actually worth exploring (side quests were too MMOish, but still an interesting world).  BotW is a tad too cumbersome for my taste."
41622,"Honestly the infinite stamina improved it significantly.  No more watching a green circle, no more Link getting winded after running a small distance, no more wasted time crafting stamina restoring items, and less time fussing about with horses.  It trimmed a lot of the fat."
44211,"It's still the same exploration.  It's just getting to wherever your point of interest is more quickly.  Not only that, but you can fully devote your attention to looking around since you're not constantly managing a stamina circle.  It's weird that you would mention previous Zelda games, since the Pegasus Boots in LttP were a godsend."
