51673,These were my exact thoughts when I finished the game.  It even teases you at the end making you think it might continue with Zelda going to Zoras Domain.  It would make sense since there is still a lot to do in the world to just let you continue from there.  I just dont get why so many games just put you right before the final boss when you beat it instead of just letting you continue.
