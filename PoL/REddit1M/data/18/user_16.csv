14734,Oh. Didn't know that. Still purchasable I guess.

I didn't have the special guardian armor, or guardian arrows yet. I did have the master sword and had beaten 2 of the divine beasts. I accidentally triggered the final battle and had to revert to a previous save. The zora armor sure came in handy getting to different areas. 

I think the Lynel is my favorite enemy in the game. Another one of my favorite things about the castle is the sheer amount of good loot that you get. 

It actually started because I needed more materials to craft the ancient armor so I went to the castle town ruins to take on a bunch of guardians. Once I was there I was like, oh well, might as well get that last memory too. 

I have to say, I also really love the theme of decay in the game and especially in Hyrule castle. It really gives it this dark atmosphere. The music helps with that too. 

What was all your experiences with your first visit to Hyrule Castle? "

I learned a similar lesson the first time I went to the Colosseum. Tried to snipe the lynel from one of the upper floors and also bomb him. It was raining and all of a sudden electric arrows start raining down around me. I booked it out of there, but because of the rain, he was even hitting me outside of the Colosseum. I decided to wait until I was ready to go back. And that was just a blue lynel too. "
