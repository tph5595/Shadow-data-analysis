40240,"I've heard a lot of people complain about the lack of enemy diversity, but maybe you just haven't played enough of the game, yet. There are at least 15 different types of enemies that I can think of right now, and almost EVERY type has different classes such as red, blue, black, silver, skeleton, ice, fire, and shock-just to name the ones I can remember off the top of my head. That has to be at least 50-60 different enemies. Even if you don't count the ""re-skinned"" baddies as a unique enemy, most types have a skeletal version, and there are four different guardian types that look and act different from one another. That's at least 30 enemies.  I do recall thinking early on in the game that I was fighting a lot of moblins, but that changed the longer I played. "
65961,"Exactly. I don't  know what these people want. I can't think of one single other game that has more variety. Look at skyrim, which BOTW is heavily based off of. You have different humans in different clothes, with different weapons, and sometimes magic, and then some monsters. "
