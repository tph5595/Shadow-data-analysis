28569,"40 seems really high.  Is that including the minibosses and bosses?  Because in the overworld there are Bokoblins, Octoroks, Moblins, ChuChus, Keese, Wizzrobes, the big and little skeletons, Lizalfos, and then Guardians (plus their mini variants) that I can name off the top of my head.  There are probably more, but that's nowhere *near* 40."
