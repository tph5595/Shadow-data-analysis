64432,"It could have been better, perhaps, but it isn't nearly as bad as you're making it out to be.

There's bokoblins, lizalfoes, and moblins, each of which have multiple variations (some just color-coded difficulty increases, others with differences in elements and attack style) and skeletal versions of each, keese (normal, fire, ice, and electric), chuchus (again, normal, fire, ice, and electric), taluses and pebblits (with normal, fire, and ice variations), hinoxes and stalnoxes, lynels of several varieties, oktoroks (normal, water, rock, disguised, etc.), Yiga archers, Yiga swordsmen, moldugas, wolves, wizzrobes (fire, ice, electric), normal guardians (mobile and immobile), flying guardians, and scout guardians, off the top of my head.

Like the other guy said, if you aren't seeing any enemy diversity at all, it's probably just because you haven't seen a lot of the game yet."
66336,"I mean, the enemy variety in BoTW definitely could have been better.  Fighting the Molduga in the Gerudo desert was a really cool encounter and having enemies unique to each area rather than just variations of enemies that can be found elsewhere would have been cool.

But it definitely isn't nearly as bad as some people are making it out to be."
