I've tried finding empty spaces in the game by flying off towers in random directions, and I always land near something of interest.  Something jumps out, a puzzle is revealed, a world boss appears, I find something valuable, etc.  There's stuff everywhere.

The shrine puzzles weren't difficult (some briefly gave me pause), but they were all pretty unique.  There's a few very similar ones (tests of strength, the motion controlled platforms...), but still a lot of variety.

There is very little story if you're comparing it to linear single player games.  But open worlds tell their stories differently, they show it to you and let you define it yourself.  Diablo tells it's story with atmosphere, not dialog.  BoTW tells it's story with the experiences you uncover within the world."

Instead of standing in OoTs shadow with TP, BoTW stands on its own alongside OoT as one of the greatest games I've played."

They are more likely to attack when they have a numbers advantage or when you're low health.  I even killed one in a pack, and the rest scattered in fear.  Pretty awesome detail imo."
