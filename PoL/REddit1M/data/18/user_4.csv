2853,"Without telling me any story spoilers, I have questions about later in the game. I haveone more beast to save and a few missing memory pic locations. Long story short I need to try to see the ending soon since I'm leaving on a long work trip soon and I'd like my wife to enjoy that part with me. Now questions..

-I hear there may be different endings. Without telling me specifics of the story, what do I need to get the best ending?

-How is the post game? Pretty much no different? Does Ganon stay gone or does it act like OOT for example in ehich it saves before the fight and you start back there?
