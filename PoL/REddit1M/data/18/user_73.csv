67095,"This is instantly one of my favourite games I have ever played. I just have a few nitpicks at what Nintendo could've improved on.

* I feel like there were a lot of unanswered questions in the story. An example of this is when the game ends zelda is miraculously still the same age. Also, I don't know if I missed anything, but what were Zelda's failures that made her despise link at first? 
* Enemy diversity limited to 3 minibosses, and they could have used just a few more enemies for the bokoblin camps. I would also like to argue about the combat shrines, even though this is the most obvious target, I think Nintendo could've just changed the environment the shrine is in each time to spice the combat shrines up.
* Final boss fight feels epic but should've been much harder

That's it for what I think. It's pretty awesome that this game has some very apparent flaws but is still so spectacular. Just shows how much games can still improve.
