1077,"So, I have a question and wanted people's input. With Memory 13 and the ending of the game, a lot of people said that Zelda was awakening the Goddess Hylia's dormant power in her. I dont think that was the case. I think she was awakening the power of the entire Triforce. If you notice when she used it, there was no empty spots, it was full. Did anyone else get that notion?"
1746,I am completely fine with it. I think the only thing that feels off is Cryosis since thats less 'Ancient' technology and more elemental. But you need em for the world. 
2092,"As far as I know (and theorize) no. Demise, in short as well Ganon, were as powerful as the Three Goddess so I don't think the Triforce can be used that way.

Also, in terms of BotW, even if the Triforce was that powerful, I don't think Zelda could do that. She was completely inexperienced in it and, for all intents and purposes, was about to probably die due to the strain on her body. I only figure that cause she could only, at best before Link severely weakened him, was able to seal him for 100 years."
2666,That's why I'm confused of what she actually did haha.

To get the best ending, you need all the Memories.

There is no post game."
13365,"It's hard to explain, but in a simpler term, Demise is a Demon Lord and his power is the equivalent to the Old Ones. Think like a Titan. He can be beaten, sealed away, but he can't be destroyed even with the Triforce; even after he's defeated, his influence remains."

22496,I thought that but on the scroll it also shows her wielding the Triforce too.
