3321,"Just beat the game last night. Anybody else disappointed in the Rito village backstory with their divine beast? It almost felt like each new divine beast felt a lot less personal. From most personal to least I would say:

Zora -&gt; Gerudo -&gt; Goron -&gt; Rito. "
17427,I think for me it wouldn't have mattered if I went there first or last. I think the lost connection Mipha had with Link is what made the Zora Domain more of a personal quest. 
23150,I got this ending but I didn't realize it was a true ending. Is it unlocked from doing every main story quest before defeating Ganon?
