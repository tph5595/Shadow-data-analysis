26432,"I just tried to raid the castle but I made the critical mistake of going into the second gatehouse. WHAT. THE. HELL. 

Ok yes, I know Lynels are supposed to be hard. And yes, adding those floating heads makes for a trickier challenge. But COME ON. I made a tactical retreat to the window, put some stone wall between me and Tirek, and hid behind the Guardian (who hilariously didn't notice). I started getting an ancient arrow ready and LOL NO SHOCK ARROWS RAINING THROUGH THE STONE CEILING. I had no option left but to abandon the royal claymore I dropped and bug out. There's difficult and then there's just plain BS. "
