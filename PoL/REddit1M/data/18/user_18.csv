Don't get me wrong, I think this is probably my favorite Zelda game since OoT but in order for it to have been a perfect Zelda game, I think dungeons needed more emphasis."

To me, BotW was the polar opposite of TP.  Where TP concentrated mainly on dungeons at the sacrifice of the overworld, BotW was the opposite, so neither of them quite hit the perfect mark but BotW was very close."

Dungeons are a huge part of the series in my opinion and that's by far the biggest problem I have with BotW.  I love it's overworld and artistic direction and it might be warranting of a perfect score, but it's not a perfect Zelda game.  I miss the clever themed dungeons of past Zelda games."
