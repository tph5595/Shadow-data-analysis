17200,"I beat the game the other day and I spent some time yesterday browsing this subreddit. I have a lot of thoughts and no one else to share them with, so I wanted to put something here. This post has some major spoilers and is going to be really long, just letting you know.

I've been reading about some people's thoughts on this game, and it seems like some of the flaws people found are due to having different expectations going into it. Mostly, these flaws stem from the story, music, and really the game's identity. I think some people saw the Zelda title, watched the trailer, and started to formulate an idea of how this game was going to play out. I'm definitely included in this category, but I'm really glad Nintendo went in a different direction than what I had expected. 

The game's central goal was to create a completely explorable game and everything in the game revolves around that goal. They delivered masterfully. The ""open-air"" category rather than ""open world"" is really fitting, because you can drop a pin anywhere on the map and find a way to get there, giving you complete freedom. They definitely stressed creating an intricate and well defined world tailored toward exploration and discovery. This concept spills over into how the world is constructed, not only in the details of the terrain, but also in the NPCs you meet and your interactions with them. Someone on this subreddit hit the nail on the head with the difference between ""worldbuilding"" and ""storytelling."" This game's actual story arc is pretty shallow, because it all happened 100 years ago. The only forward arc left is for you to free the 4 Divine Beasts, beat Calamity Ganon, and free Zelda. There's not much else that happens in between. It makes sense, though, considering their central goal. A linear story wouldn't really work if they wanted to have a fully free game, so they created the memories to tell the story in a way to incentivize exploration. Unfortunately, this style created an un-involved main story. 

However, this game's perfection is in the details. I was traveling through Faron Woods when I first met Kass. He gave me my first shrine quest and I thought he was an interesting character. As I explored the world, I kept running into him, and he shared details on his Shekiah teacher and some details about the Calamity. Eventually, I found him atop Gerudo Tower, where he says his theme song is really a song written by his teacher for the hero who fell, and he hopes to play it for the hero one day so that's why he is practicing. These NPC interactions happen all the time, and there's other small details in the game that bolster the contents of the story. You can find Zelda's journal inside her room in Hyrule Castle that fills in a lot of her attitudes toward herself and Link, which enrich the contents of the memories. You can also visit the upstairs in Impa's house to read Paya's diary, where she reveals her crush on Link. These things are pretty entertaining to read, but they humanize these characters in a way to make them relatable and give you reasons to save them from Ganon. These subtleties are what make this game shine. 

Another thing this game gets a lot of flack for is its musical score. I thought it was fantastic. The ambient piano with cameos of songs from other games were perfect for the setting of a post-destruction Hyrule returning to peace. There's a calmness about this world where an epic score (like the Dark World from ALttP or the Hyrule Field theme from OoT) wouldn't be the right fit. It's been 100 years since Ganon attacked and he hasn't done anything since (and not many people know that's only because he's continually being held back by Zelda). The world is returning to some level of normalcy, the wilderness is still, and the ruins are unchanging. I can't imagine any other style capturing this feeling as well. 

Overall, I think some people saw a new Zelda game coming out and expected a certain adherence to the old formula regarding the story and dungeons. I did miss the traditional story arc and dungeons as well, but if you consider the standpoint of their central goal, these aspects were more of an afterthought, especially if you're trying to break the conventions on what it means to be a Zelda game.  My only closing thought and slight disappointment is in the lack of a postgame. I never expected it since Zelda games never had one, but given the sheer depth of this world and its story/lore, I think it really needs one. I also thought there was a lack of closure after beating Ganon, and a postgame will fill that void. That's why I'm hoping the DLC later this year isn't a side story that happened along the way, but a continuation of the story after Ganon is gone. To anyone that made it this far, thanks for taking the time to read this long ass post. 

**TL;DR:** Some of people's perceived flaws about the game might have been due to a failure of the game to meet expectations it never tried to fill. If you take the time to absorb every detail in this game, you'll find an incredible amount of depth to both the world and the story. "
