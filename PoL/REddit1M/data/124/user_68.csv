25395,"&gt; It was never confirmed to actually be relevant to the series canon before tho

It was published with the game. It's canon. "
25431,The manual published with the game is canon. Do you think only in-game content is canon or something? 
25717,"&gt; Because it was a english translation only thing that was present in the manual for ALttP and not even in the game

Why do you think that's a valid argument? "
25865,"None of what you just said is a valid explanation. 

Of course the game's manual is canon. Why would what a remake does have any effect on canon? Something released with the original game surely holds more weight than something released with a remake. 

You're swinging around some really weak arguments here. "
25905,Except it was. 
25992,"&gt; Even the English ALttP manual has more credibility

Why wouldn't it? "
