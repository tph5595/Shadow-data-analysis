34560,"I don't remember them mentioning the transformation, but Rauru does tell Link ""[Ganondorf] obtained the Triforce from the Temple of Light, and with its power, he became the King of Evil."" Zelda later refers to the power of all three pieces as the True Force. She too goes on to say that ""the Triforce fell into Ganondorf's hands."" 

I feel like we can comfortably say that, at least in OoT, Triforce can certainly refer to a piece, especially if it's being used since all pieces would be the True Force. In that case, Ganondorf absolutely uses the Triforce to transform. "
