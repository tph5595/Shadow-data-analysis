12403,"So I know it's written here (and everywhere else it appears) as Ganondorf Dragmire, but does anyone else think it would actually technically be Dragmire Ganondorf? Because in Riju's diary, her full name is given as Makeela Riju, which would seem to indicate that Gerudo naming conventions put the surname first, just like in Japanese and Chinese."

31169,"That... never even occurred to me, actually. Could well be!

I'm still more inclined to think it's a surname, because with how freely BotW used other Gerudo words, it seems odd that they'd come up with a separate Gerudo title for ""chief/queen/etc"" and then have everyone in the game calling her Chief or Lady instead. But all the diary says is ""Diary of Makeela Riju, Chief of the Gerudo,"" so it's still entirely possible!"
