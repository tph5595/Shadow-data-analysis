39333,"I think the issue with Link having a last name is that it's rarely the same guy. So if Ocarina is named Link Koriras, that'd have no effect on Link Wolfe or Link Windson.

Zelda and Ganon could get away with it because all the Zeldas are related by blood and happen to be the royal family, so the royal name would carry on, and Ganondorf is flat out the same guy coming back over and over.  

(Yes, I made those Surnames up)."
