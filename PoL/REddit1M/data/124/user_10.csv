4642,"Yeah. According to the article, Nintendo just updated their site for Zelda and refer to him as ""Ganondorf Dragmire"" in their description for Ganondorf. There was no official announcement or anything."
23174,"Possibly, but there are some things that make the veracity of the site at least questionable. For example, on the very same page they say that Ganondorf Dragmire used the Triforce to transform into the monster Ganon. But on the most literal level, ALBW Ganon is the only one confirmed in-game to have used the whole Triforce to transform into beast Ganon (and many players think that this information from ALBW's back story is confused or inaccurate). We know for certain that FSA Ganondorf didn't use the Triforce to transform into beast Ganon, and we're told that LoZ Ganon was already beast Ganon before he got his hands on the Triforce of Power. Oracles Ganon didn't have the Triforce at all. ALttP says that beast Ganon is the one who wished on the Triforce rather than human Ganondorf. Etc.

Because the site doesn't mention which Ganondorf it's talking about, and the identifying paragraph that accompanies this Ganondorf includes information that doesn't match with every Ganondorf, at best this would probably only be indirect confirmation of one/some Ganondorf(s) having the last name ""Dragmire"". At worst it's fan fiction not officially authorized by the creators of the game. So the reality is probably somewhere in the middle with it being a sort of tertiary canon applicable to only certain Ganondorfs until further notice."
24323,"Since he doesn't transform until the very end of the game, I don't think anyone in OoT mentions Ganondorf using the Triforce to transform. They might have said something like that in TWW, but I don't specifically remember that since all of TWW's back story just talks about beast Ganon and not the human Ganondorf at all.

We should probably look at how the site uses ""Triforce"" in other entries to determine whether it's being used literally or metaphorically in this case. But again, we know that not every Ganondorf became beast Ganon through the whole Triforce, a Triforce piece, or potentially-Triforce-related god magic, so the identifying paragraph can't be speaking about every Ganondorf in the series."
39599,"FSA Ganondorf is definitely a different Ganondorf. They talk about his birth in that game and how his role among the Gerudo was to be guardian of the desert, not king of the Gerudo, so he pretty much has to be a different guy. (Out-of-game, Nintendo has also said he's a different guy.) Technically only OoT Ganondorf and TWW Ganondorf have been explicitly confirmed to be the same guy in-game. Out-of-game, Nintendo has said that LoZ Ganon, ALttP Ganondorf, OoT Ganondorf, Oracles Ganon, TWW Ganondorf, and TP Ganondorf are all one guy, but there's been no comment so far on ALBW Ganon or BotW Ganon. However, these Ganons have so many similarities and so many differences that you could theoretically argue the existence of anywhere between two and eight Ganons throughout the series. So right now there are only two to four Ganons in the series according to Nintendo, but they could change their minds at a later date."
