20756,Yup. ALTTP takes place after OoT in the timeline where Ganondorf defeats Link in OoT. He successfully acquires the Triforce and uses its power to create The Dark World.

&gt;One day evil power began to flow from the Golden Land...    
So the King commanded seven wise men to seal the gate to the Land of the Golden Power.

From what I understand, Ganon used the Triforce to transform the Sacred Realm into the Dark World, and then the seven sages sealed the Dark World to contain him. I don't see anything about them tricking him into going there."
