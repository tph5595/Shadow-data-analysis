18932,Well WW Link is completely separate from the original Links because of the whole OoT Link being removed from the time line along with Ganon saying he doesn't have an blood of the hero in him.
20420,"I think we can assume TP is related to OoT link somehow based on the Hero's shade. Plus, OoT Link never really did much in that timeline so his lineage ending up in a farming town makes decent sense."
21488,"Unless he died before he could teach :/

You know, thinking back, OoT link probably gets the biggest shaft out of all the Link's after the game. Either he dies, is erased from a timeline, or dies and becomes a wandering spirit. It's kind of sad honestly.
