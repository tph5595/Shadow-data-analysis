(Would've been nice to link directly to the video, by the way)"
9536,"Hmm, just because one species evolved from another doesn't automatically remove the other species. It just means that a group of the parent species branched off and adapted to a different environment so much they became something totally new, while the parent species is still in its original environment (if they managed to survive that long). 

Iirc, this can happen in the case of lack of food. You've got a species with limited food, groups of them who can't get access to the food will find alternatives. Meanwhile, the ones were already maintaining access to their food stick around. 

I recall a study on finches that demonstrates all of this. Fun stuff. I'm pretty sure that Kurzgesagt has a video on it in YouTube. "
14185,"I have a feeling that people don't understand this concept too well because of the way it's taught (barring the whole discussion on creationism which shouldn't be taught in non-religious schools at all). 

I know I've seen evolution shown as this sort of timeline. This evolved into that evolved into that, almost like it were a multi-generational metamorphosis. I get that it's probably a simple and ""easy to understand"" explanation to teach evolution but it's a bit misleading if not outright wrong. Evolution is not a straight line but people often think so. And then you get the nonsense of ""well if Y evolved from X, why does X still exist?!"" (As if X isn't also an evolved version it's predecessor X)"
22303,"One way to visualize it is kinda with like a tree. [Here's a simple example. ](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/96/5f/8b/965f8bf3f910a5438f79279b3e77a511.jpg) In this example, you see that the branches occur and end on different time periods and there's a period in time where some branches lived concurrently with another and with a predecessor. 

I suggest asking someone better versed in this topic if you want to learn more. "
29611,"I actually thought it was a reference to time travel tropes (timey wimey ball or something) but took the moment to add more. :) I hope it helps someone understand evolution better. (It'll also help people see birds and dinosaurs in a whole new light, it's fascinating)"
185018,"&gt; Furthermore, to sum up my last statement, all physical incarnations likely have different last names, and may as well have different first names as well for all we know. Only exception being The Hero of the Wild. 

And LoZ/AoL Link, who cannot be renamed, either. 

Then you have Link's Awakening, but given that the Japanese title is The Dreaming Island (夢を見る島), I wouldn't count it. Not to mention that the Link in that game gets called whatever you name him. "
