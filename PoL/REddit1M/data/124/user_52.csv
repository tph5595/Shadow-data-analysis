18954,"Honestly, Miyamoto's answers should jus tbe ignored.  
He is pretty much always either : Kidding  
Not caring (and making stuff up on the spot)  
and/or being mistranslated.  

At this point, I'd say Aonuma is the real guy to rely on for any Zelda informaton"
19033,"Fierce Deity isn't really called a ""bad guy"" originally.  
he is called ""the oni"" which is the name for who is ""it"" during tag in Japan.  

So Majora was just saying that Link was ""it"""
19083,"It was never confirmed to actually be relevant to the series canon before tho.  
since its only appearance was in an old localized manual (which used to love making random shit up back in the day)"
25943,"It was published with only a single version of the game, and not the japanese one.   
Manuals have been wrong many times before back in those days."
63224,"He calls you that after you say you'll play with him.  
And oni is still used for tag in japan"
68360,"An oni is also a being from folklore yes.  
But it is also used as the ""it"" with tag.  
This is like saying being ""it"" during tag can't be a thing cause of Stephen King's ""it"" existing.  

The ""you are the oni"" line in Majora's Mask obviously refers to tag tho.  
Majora just asked you to play with him so the context should be clear"
