53107,This site is written and run by POP. It's no more canon than something like a Manga is.
53271,"According to the English manual, the sages forged the Master Sword after Ganon got the Triforce, and it is specifically designed to counter the Triforce's magic. The quality control of translations from Nintendo is notoriously bad, especially back in the SNES days. Anything not in the original Japanese versions found in translations might as well be fanfiction. "
53493,"Well then I guess the Master Sword was forged in the Downfall Timeline specifically to block the Triforce and fight Ganon. That makes a lot of sense, right? Why in heaven's name would something the original author did not say be canon? "
53586,Because it made up a bunch of things that weren't in the original manual? 
53837,"It was in the English manual of A Link to the Past. It was made up by the NoA translator for the manual and isn't in the original Japanese version. The GBA remake removed most of the fanfiction that was in the SNES English manual. The name was never used in any other instance. Even now, you should know Zelda.com is not a translation of a Japanese version of a Zelda site. In fact, it's not even written by NoA, it's run by an organization called POP. "
53911,Well a good thing Zelda.com isn't a canon source of information. 
54092,"No, we dismiss the canonicity not because its a manual, but because it was made up by the translators. We care about what was originally stated in Japanese. According to the manual, the Master Sword was forged by the Sages to null the Triforce's magic after Ganon obtained it. I guess you think that's canon as well?"
