20299,Well. If it's the official site that's more or less indirect confirmation isn't it?
23875,"To my knowledge don't they use ""Triforce"" rather loosely? I vaguely remember them mentioned in OoT that ""Ganon used the Triforce to transform."" Even though he only possess his piece. The Triforce of Power. Likewise, Each individual piece seems to be considered ""A Triforce."" 

So if we take that into consideration, If would sound accurate. But it seems to change because in some games they would just straight say Triforce and in others they would say Triforce Piece."
