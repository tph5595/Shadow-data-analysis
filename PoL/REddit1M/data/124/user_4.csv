1369,Zelda's last name is probably Hyrule due to the fact she's always a member of the Hyrule Royal Family. Link's last name probably changes with each new incarnation as there is rarely a known direct lineage for him.
9807,"Yeah that's always links story we occasionally have some relatives like links uncle in ALttP, is grandmother and sister in windwaker, mention of his father in BotW. But there isn't an easy to establish family line like with the royal family of Hyrule."
11651,"Unless WW Link and Tetra hooked up when founding the Hew Hyrule which would mean WW Link is now part of that Hyrule Royal Family line so ST Link while looking similar to ""Old King Link"" would probably at best be descended from maybe Links Sister? Same bloodline to result in the physical similarities but not part of the new pure royal family line?"
19900,"That is true, I also question TP Links lineage lol."
21286,"Idk, the Hero's Shades deal is that he's still hanging around because he was unable to pass his skills on to a successor, if he had kids wouldn't he have taught it to them so they could pass it down?"
21611,"Yeah, as much as i love Zelda and the whole franchise OoT Zelda is really the worse Zelda that caused the most problems."
