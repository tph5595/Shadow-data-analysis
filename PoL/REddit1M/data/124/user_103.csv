His birth name probably wasn't even Link. Maybe he *was* named after the Hero of Time, but maybe he wasn't. His parents could've named him Retlo for all anyone cares.

Which brings me to his last name. His last name might just change  depending on who his parent's were. In OoT, his parent's left him with the Kokiri, so maybe their last names were TOTALLY unrelated."

It's why Din, Farore, Lanayru, and Hylia don't have surnames either.

Furthermore, to sum up my last statement, all physical incarnations likely have different last names, and may as well have different first names as well for all we know. Only exception being The Hero of the Wild. "
