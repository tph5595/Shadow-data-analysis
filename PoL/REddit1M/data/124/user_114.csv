61317,Actually any Gerudo male is instantly made the king. The problem is Ganon keeps coming back which kind of stops anybody else from claiming the title. One Gerudo male is born every one hundred years. Which is why I was disappointed that nobody reacts in BOTW if you get all of the male Gerudo armour.
