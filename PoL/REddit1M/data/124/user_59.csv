21553,"I THINK they're mostly the same-ish entity. In the beginning it seems there was Demise, who is the ""unending curse"" and manifests itself in certain ways. Possibly manifesting as Vaati early on? Dunno about that one...

Then possibly manifested as Ganondorf of the Gerudo tribe in OoT. This Ganondorf is apparently able to transform into Ganon in certain instances as he does in OoT and Twilight Princess, or just staying normal like in TWW. In the ""hero defeated"" timeline it seems that he never reverts back to regular, Gerudo Ganondorf again and just stays Ganon every time he resurfaces. 

But it seems to be that Ganon(dorf) is one, cursed entity, born before OoT and just reappears multiple times in the different timelines, in sometimes different forms (regular Gerudo, vs beast and such)."
