38421,That's cause it is Yeto's home!
38829,"No, but it is generally assumed that City in the Sky is the remains of all the sky islands after hundreds if not thousands of years of technological advancements in their save little area in the sky.  

But I don't think we will ever get a guarenteed answer for it."
39169,You pretty much fight it twice and a third time that might as well be a cutscene you have control over.
39301,"&gt;
EDIT: and its dearth of dungeons. 7 total as compared to Twilight Princess' 9.  

not really a fair comparison.  
TP has more than normal, partly cause it took over some stuff from WW's lost content.  

Also, Awful characters ?  
Are we talking about the same SS ?  
People constantly praise how alive Skyloft feels, and how great Groose and the Link-Zelda interaction in that game was.

39499,"I also potentially think that the death of the sage of the mountain area, might have made the area more dangerous, even before Ganondorf's invasion.  
So keeping people stationed there permanently and keeping it stocked might not have been worth the hassle.  

.

What's interesting though, is that in TP:HD, there are paintings of Queen Rutella there, so that means either the yetis got them SOMEHOW, or more likely : it was still in use until less than a zora generation ago."
55914,"Honestly, all of TP's bosses were easy as all fuck, even for zelda bosses, but I still love all of them cause of how memorable all of them are."
84220,"&gt; Why not? TP was in development for 4 years (2002-2006). So was SS (2007-2011). They probably had some TP leftovers to cannibalize for SS, too. And besides, a lot of TP got overhauled or reworked when it was moved from GameCube to Wii and delayed twice. SS didn't face that problem.

Uhm no, TP didn't have anything to cannibalize cause it all got used for TP. 
WW had a lot of cut stuff, including atleast 2 dungeons.    

TP had very little cut content of that sort.  

Also, Hyrule Castle and Twilight Realm are both pretty meh dungeons on their own.  

&gt;
7 vs. 9 is a totally valid criticism. And not only did TP have more dungeons, it had better dungeons.v  

That's subjective.  

7 vs 9 is ""valid criticism"" in the same way that saying WW had a MUCH bigger overworld then all the other games combined would be.  

&gt;
Well, ""people"" are often wrong. Again, see my comment. Don't want to hash it all out twice.  

Ever heard of copy pasting?  
 
Anyway, you just put your own opinion as the fact, but that isn't how  
&gt; among Zelda fans  

feel at all.  
Groose has a BIG fanbase.  
And people loved Ghirahim as a villain  

Just cause you disliked that stuff/those npcs doesn't mean everyone did.  
I'm not even gonna bother replying to all the shit you spewed in that other comment.  

before I just thought you were being silly, now I realize you are just blind.  

""windwaker atleast wasn't as easy and thus didn't get hate for it""  
Fucking lol.  
Windwaker is consistently considered the easiest game in the series.  

You should re-read your own comment, and notice how often you say : ""**I** don't get the appeal"", ""**I** didn't like X and y"" etc...  
But then in the comment above you pretty much were making statements for the zelda fanbase as a whole.  
While those things are exactly the shit people fucking loved about SS  

it's the textboxes popping up, fi repeating information and motions controls that ""the people"" hated about SS.  
not the amazing dungeons, well loved characters.  

Also: Skyloft =/= the sky.  
Skyloft is ONLY the city, and people LOVE skyloft, but HATE the sky.

158947,"Yes but there is never specifically said that the oocca are the Sky people from SS.  
it totally fits into all the ""slots"", it's just never specifically said.
