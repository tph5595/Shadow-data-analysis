I call them temples when they have temple in the name(Lakebed Temple) but in my head I refer to all temples, dungeons, Mansions, whatever the fuck, as dungeons myself. Because that's just how I see them. But that's just me. I used to call them temples. It's just up to their choice. There's no need to be so correct about terminology it's just a video game made by Nintendo "

I'm not hating and I didn't downvote, I'm just telling you why others did. It was a correct use of the downvote system and you can't get mad at /r/Zelda or any other subreddit for the behavior. "

36339,/truezelda if you want legit discussion about Zelda. It's great. 
57698,"""I don't think I am...it's a distinction that needs to be made IMO."" That's not a contribution at all unfortunately. While I can agree the rest were trying to, this comment wasn't. I don't think the hivemind would've hit that hard if he didn't make that comment but whatever what are you gonna do
