6866,"I've always wondered what the story behind that place was. Who inhabited it, why was it destroyed. It's always seemed like one of those mysteries we'll never get an official answer to."
18709,That's along the lines of what I was thinking. Although I wonder what it's connection to the Zoras is seeing as in the first room there's what looks to be a portrait of the Zora queen. Could just be random filler images but you never know. Personally I like to think that an elite group of knights trained there using the extreme conditions in their training but that's just something I completely came up with myself and can't substantiate at all.
24723,Agreed! It's the same thing with Dessert Colossus in OoT. Who does the statue depict? We'll never know but the mystery is what makes it interesting!
