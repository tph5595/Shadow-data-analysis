97135,"Oh the memories. Me and my friend playing downstairs at 3:00 am wandering around the castle, wondering why this place is so big, then noticing on the map that there's a boss room. It wasn't until 4:30 am that we started asking, ""Why is she coming with us to the boss?"" then my friend saying, ""I think I know why she's going in there with you."" Oh the chills a castle in the mountains can give you. Oh the chills of Zelda Twilight Princess."
