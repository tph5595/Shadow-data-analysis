The mansion has some weird rooms and lots of weapons lying around and is an extremely easy to defend locale, the arbiters ground has sealed off small chambers with nothing in them (cells) that basically get shut away when the elevator shafts is all the way up (as you find them), the temple of time somehow exists in some alternative space, the sky city is literally what's left of skyloft (and Nintendo kind of had an idea of what skyloft would be at that point.) 

It's not the only game with dungeons like that. It's just the only one where most of the dungeons were like that and were really good at nailing down the mood. "

Hyrule is tp is in decay, and it's never addressed why. It also makes me want to play a Zelda game where hyrule is at its peak and everything that's in ruins in TP is just sparkling new.
