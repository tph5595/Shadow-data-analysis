Especially more now that I beat Xenoblade X."
100961,I always felt that most bosses of the 3D Zelda games were always pretty easy when you get the pattern.
101458,"Pretty much you are hating on WW and the other guy is hating on SS.

Both are great games. So just enjoy what you like. Im pretty sure neither of you will change the other perspective about the game."
102334,"This, Temple of Time and Sky City are the highlights of TP for me. Too bad they are literally the last dungeons in the game...
The introduction and the first part of the game really kills the replayability for me :(

Oh well, I have a save before entering Snowpeak, might as well continue that one..."
163115,"I get you, I liked both.
But the problem I have with SS is that I have no motivation to replay it ever again. I really liked some things but I also hated some things. Most of the changes that SS had are like 50% good and 50% bad, at least for me.
That's probably why it has mixed feelings among Zelda players."
168483,"Haha, and your feelings about SS are the same as mine on WW. At least we agree that we are hyped for Zelda U? :P"
172775,"Errm well, every feeling except that...
I should have mentioned it."
261419,Fair enough.
