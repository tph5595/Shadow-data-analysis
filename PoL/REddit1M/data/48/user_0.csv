22373,It's a distinction without a difference.
22638,"If we want to get really needlessly technical, the first three are a tree, a cavern, and a fish, followed by five temples and one castle.

But fuck it; they're all dungeons. That's what you call a monster-filled hole in a fantasy game."
22818,"I also really appreciate the design of Snowpeak Ruins. Go to the spot, search for key, bring back ingredient, add to soup, repeat. As you progress through the dungeon, the soup gets better. And it's made by Yetis.

Twilight Princess is awesome."
23118,"While I appreciate the theme and mood of all 9 dungeons in TP, Snowpeak is perhaps the most unique. It's surprising in the way that the first four aren't, without being as minimal as the next four."
23315,"To be fair, I think Arbiter's Grounds has a similar feel. Only instead of tracking up then sledding down Snowpeak, you have to cross a vast desert and storm a fortress.

Twilight Princess is awesome."
23451,The elements probably weathered it during years of neglect. It only takes one bad snow to bring the roof or a wall down in an old house.
23545,"And I hope we never do. Sometimes, our imaginations are better than what anyone can actually come up with. That's why so much of Zelda works so well. It gives you just enough dots to connect yourself."
23941,"&gt;I'm not sure what the average consensus on ss is

Among gamers generally, SS received enormous praise and widespread acclaim. It has some of the highest ratings of any game ever, let alone Zelda game.

But among Zelda fans, I think many of us were disappointed with several aspects of the game, like its awful characters, repetitive design choices, underwhelming overworld, insulting level of difficulty, and relatively small map.

EDIT: and its dearth of dungeons. 7 total as compared to Twilight Princess' 9."
24115,"Oracle of Ages came three years after Ocarina of Time, meaning Jabu Jabu in OoT was unique while Jabu Jabu in OoA was not."
24246,"Check out this filthy casual. [Read up](http://zeldawiki.org/Jabu-Jabu%27s_Belly).

Both Oracles are on 3DS. Go play them."
29072,"Excellent question. For ""most unique Zelda dungeon,"" I would submit the following contenders from each game.

Top-Down:

* [Skull Woods](http://tinyurl.com/hvycr7e) (*Link to the Past*)

* [Color Dungeon](http://zeldawiki.org/Color_Dungeon) (*Link's Awakening DX*)

* [Fortress of Winds](http://zeldawiki.org/Fortress_of_Winds) (*Minish Cap*)

* [Mutoh's Temple](http://zeldawiki.org/Mutoh%27s_Temple) (*Phantom Hourglass*)

* [Lost at Sea Station](http://zeldawiki.org/Lost_at_Sea_Station) (*Spirit Tracks*)

* [Dark Palace](http://zeldawiki.org/Dark_Palace) (*Link Between Worlds*)

3D:

* [Shadow Temple](http://zeldawiki.org/Shadow_Temple) (*Ocarina of Time*)

* [Stone Tower](http://zeldawiki.org/Stone_Tower_Temple) (*Majora's Mask*)

* [Tower of the Gods](http://zeldawiki.org/Tower_of_the_Gods) (*Wind Waker*)

* [Snowpeak Ruins](http://zeldawiki.org/Snowpeak_Ruins) (*Twilight Princess*)

* [Sky Keep](http://zeldawiki.org/Sky_Keep) (*Skyward Sword*)

Basically, anything colorful (but not monochromatic), well-designed, and not based on a biome or element makes for a good dungeon, imho. This precludes forest, fire, water, desert, and ice almost across the board, since some variation on these is in every Zelda game.

Most unique overall is tough to call. It's basically a subjective exercise in what I personally found memorable at this point, but here goes.

Zelda I is omitted from my list because it's incredibly bare. Revolutionary, but bare. Everything looks and plays the same throughout the entire game. It's not interesting for this discussion.

Zelda II is total bullshit and I can't get into it, nor do I know anyone who can.

Skull Woods played with mixing the dungeon and the overworld together, and had a spectacular atmosphere. But like all dungeons in LttP, it's boring in its gameplay and visuals.

Color Dungeon was included in the Director's Cut of Link's Awakening to help demonstrate the advantage of the GameBoy Color. It's fun and has a great aesthetic, but does little to innovate.

Fortress of Winds was the least boring of Minish Cap's dungeons, which were all pretty standard. I liked how it was tucked away in an almost Mayan ruin outside a swamp, and how the Digging Mitts really open it up, but it's plain.

Mutoh's Temple is cool. Really fucking cool. The locale, the look, the design – everything just works, and it doesn't feel like anything else in PH. It's one of my favorite spots in any Zelda game ever.

Lost at Sea Station was an unexpected surprise in an otherwise expectable game. It's hidden, optional, and is a replica of the Temple of the Ocean King from PH, which I thought stood out in ST. I wish more games had the balls to include a totally optional level that's easy to miss.

Link Between Worlds is my favorite top-down Zelda ever, but it has its flaws. Namely, the dungeons aren't very unique and they're all designed to be easy enough to be your first dungeon. But the Dark Palace is a real treat. It's situated across a maze and stealth level, and plays with the mechanics in cool ways that also play with the visuals, which is tough to pull off. Only other one in this list to even try is Color Dungeon.

Shadow Temple is a trip. It didn't have some enormous monument telegraphing its location. Who honestly expected a whole dungeon up on some shelf in the back corner of the mountain village? Really? Add that to its insane atmosphere and high degree of difficulty and you've got one of the best levels in any game ever.

Stone Tower is awesome. Ikana Canyon has amazing atmosphere, and this dungeon is ingeniously designed, like two dungeons rolled into one. It avoids being the token desert level, which I appreciate.

Tower of the Gods is incredible. I don't think anyone expected Wind Waker to unfold the way it did. Instead of three introductory levels leading you to four or five others (like LttP, OoT, TP), Wind Waker tossed in its third real dungeon and made it a landmark. Not only that, it took the Majora's Mask approach for quality over quantity. Tower of the Gods feels serious in an otherwise buoyant and breezy game.

Snowpeak Ruins is the topic of this thread, so I won't get too far into it. I will just say it represents the best marriage of atmosphere, level design, and difficulty in TP, and takes an unconventional approach. Yeti Soup. Yes, really.

Sky Keep was fascinating because, like Shadow Temple, it was an enormous level crammed into a tiny space, which I didn't expect to be at home base. Like really, who does that? Puts the final level at the very beginning? It was one of Skyward Sword's high points, if not *the* high point.

So my two finalists are Mutoh's Temple in Phantom Hourglass for top-down, and Stone Tower in Majora's Mask for 3D. I love Phantom Hourglass and Majora's Mask. They were incredibly risky games with brilliant ideas, and these levels show off just how remarkable MM and PH are, while staying totally true to Zelda."
79882,"Cool, thanks for the heads-up. I only use URL shorteners when the parentheses get stupid. Now I know how to fix that."
80167,"It's never actually specified that Jabu Jabu is a whale or not. He certainly resembles one, but the game doesn't outright say it. Jabun, in Wind Waker, is definitely a fish, and a descendent of Jabu Jabu, so I think it's safe to call Jabu Jabu a fish rather than a whale."
80373,"Yes. Skyward Sword holds your hand every step of the way and treats you like a brain-damaged toddler with the memory of a goldfish.

Twilight Princess has an easy boss or two, but doesn't take the same approach. And any boss is easy when you know its pattern well enough."
80525,"Yes, that's what makes Link Between Worlds so good. You can explore the dungeons in any order you want, and the entire map is open to you from pretty early on. Just pick an X and go for it.

That's also why I love the first Zelda. You're just dropped in a field with no context and no information, and are forced to explore the world until you make headway.

Zelda U seems to be taking this approach, emphasizing open world, non-linear exploration. I am so hyped you can't even imagine."
82296,"Those characters are fucking awful.

Groose is annoying, and distracting, and utterly loathsome. He has no place in a heroic epic like SS purports to be. He's like Biff Tannen in Back to the Future but he won't go away. He just keeps coming back, and coming back, and coming back, and drawing your attention away from Link and Zelda. Fuck Groose and his dumb hair. He's the Donald Trump of Legend of Zelda.

Ghirahim has this homoerotic overtone and pseudo David Bowie thing going on, but it doesn't work. He's just weird for the sake of being weird. There's nothing to him except that he's effeminate and creepy.

I detest them both and don't understand the appeal at all. And I can't remember *anyone* in Skyloft except the headmaster of the school. None of them really matter.

***

As for a lack of dungeons and an empty overworld, Wind Waker is different.

In SS, you have Skyloft which serves as a pointless hub. You have to fly from location to location, but there's nothing to see in Skyloft except a smattering of rocks and the Goddess Cube spots. It's completely inconsequential to the greater adventure on the ground, and just wastes your time. Skyloft is the medium by which you reach everything meaningful. It's a middle man.

In Wind Waker, the Great Seas *is* the world. You have a 7x7 map with islands in each square. You have to do a lot of tedious sailing, but there's a direct tradeoff between travel and exploration, since each square has an island, with unique things to do and see. There's 49 total spots to explore and they're all different, even if they're all far away from each other. But then you get the Ballad of Gales and that softens the sailing time. And in WWHD, you can get the quick sail, which makes it even better.

***

Concerning dungeons, WW and SS both have 7 dungeons, and both have been criticized for it.

People aren't as harsh towards WW because the dungeons aren't as insultingly easy as the ones in SS. I will concede that SS was more creative and memorable with its palette choices and themes, but the puzzles are simple and the layouts unchallenging.

WW took a quality-over-quantity approach to its dungeon design, so 7 dungeons on a vast sea with 49 islands makes them feel more important. SS didn't have a large world to complement its few dungeons, and everything feels cramped and limited. When you look at the SS [map](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/-vJqOrD3u_4/maxresdefault.jpg) compared to, say, [WW](http://pre06.deviantart.net/2fe9/th/pre/i/2013/095/4/2/the_wind_waker_full_sea_chart__very_large_scale__by_zantaff-d60hloa.jpg) or [TP](http://i.imgur.com/WlMKhtn.png), you expect a hell of a lot more from SS, like all its empty spots would fill in, but they never do.

SS skimps on the overworld, it stiffs you on the dungeons, and tries to force too many choices that don't work. It's underdeveloped, and expects you to just love it for being Zelda."
83145,"&gt;not really a fair comparison

Why not? TP was in development for 4 years (2002-2006). So was SS (2007-2011). They probably had some TP leftovers to cannibalize for SS, too. And besides, a lot of TP got overhauled or reworked when it was moved from GameCube to Wii and delayed twice. SS didn't face that problem.

7 vs. 9 is a totally valid criticism. And not only did TP have more dungeons, it had *better* dungeons.

&gt;Also, awful characters? Are we talking about the same SS?

Yes. See my [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/4afsou/i_love_how_snowpeak_manor_rolls_into_view_looking/d117dg5) to /u/boopaboopa for elaboration.

&gt;People constantly praise how alive Skyloft feels, and how great Groose and the Link-Zelda interaction in that game was.

Well, ""people"" are often wrong. Again, see my comment. Don't want to hash it all out twice."
83583,"How does someone copying something later detract from the original, exactly? Whichever came first is original, that's why the first example of something is called... *the original*.

Jabu Jabu in OoT is unique because it hadn't been done before. OoA was simply following OoT's lead, making OoA derivative. The dungeons look and play nothing alike anyway, so your criticism is ridiculous."
84151,"Yes. 1986. OG Zelda.

It's not super accessible to new players and it doesn't cater to any modern game design sensibilities, but it's a fantastic game and it laid the foundation for not only Zelda games, but *all modern games*. In their 200th issue, *Game Informer* named it their #1 game of all time for good reason.

Every open world game, every dungeon crawler, every fantasy game, every epic, every adventure game – they all owe something to Zelda and follow its template in one way or another. It isn't the *best* example of what it seeks to do, but it was the *first*, for which it deserves respect."
259803,"Art is subjective, so there's no way to ""convince"" someone to like art that they don't like. I'm not trying to change /u/boopaboopa's mind so much as provide good reasoning of my own and show the holes in his arguments. There's no harm in that."
271011,"&gt;Groose is the Donald Trump of Legend of Zelda.

&gt;&gt;That's ridiculous and reductive.

No, it's a joke.

Actually, it seems like a pretty apt analogy:

* Terrible hair? Check.

* Braggadocious with no real skill? Check.

* Divisive among the base? Check.

* Wants to build ridiculous stuff? Check.

&gt;you ignored Groose's character development

No, I *tolerated* it. He's utterly manufactured. You can see every beat of this character coming from a mile off. He's textbook bully-turned-good-guy.

&gt;[Groose is] the first person in the entire series to get [character development]

Ha, no. Working backwards, you've got Linebeck (*Phantom Hourglass*), Midna (*Twilight Princess*), Petra (*Wind Waker*), Skull Kid (*Majora's Mask*), the list goes on and on. Zelda has always had a ton of great characters who were well-developed. SS just shoves Groose in your face.

&gt;Groose is integral to Link saving the world

Yeah, ""the Groosenator."" Real world-saving contribution, that. Not like Link has a [device](http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/125705/2017881-ss_beetle_art.jpg) which can fling bombs, or a [steed](http://www.zeldadungeon.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Loftwing.png) that can move Link through the air. Nah, what he *really* needed was some idiot's makeshift catapult.

&gt;[Ghirahim] was [unique](http://img.picturequotes.com/2/35/34601/just-because-you-are-unique-doesnt-mean-you-are-useful-quote-1.jpg). Not bright, not at all motivated outside of a cultist attitude.

Thanks for making my argument for me.

&gt;I'm sorry you feel the Zelda series doesn't need more unique characters with actual emotions and development like him and Groose.

I'm sorry you feel the need to knock down straw men. I said *Groose and Ghirahim specifically* are terrible characters. I say this *because* I think Zelda needs better.

&gt;Wind Waker is different.

&gt;&gt;Why?

I elaborated in detail. Read my comment again.

&gt;WW is incomplete,

By what metric?

&gt;empty,

Already covered this. It's a game about the open ocean.

&gt;and rushed

Agreed. The development window was quite narrow. Doesn't make WW a bad game. In fact, with an aggregate score of [96](http://www.metacritic.com/game/gamecube/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker) compared with SS's [93](http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword) and dev window of 4 years, I'd say they performed *exceptionally* with WW.

&gt;with a tacked on fetch quest at the end for padding.

That's just *rich* coming from a defender of Skyward Sword. Go and Google ""Zelda fetch quest"" and every other result is something about SS.

* Skyview Temple → find some birds

* Earth Temple → find some key shards

* Lanayru Mines → find some generators

* Ancient Cistern → find some water

On and on it goes. SS is literally designed around fetch quests. It's not great in WW, but it's *torture* in SS.

At least in WW, there's only one, and it spurns you to explore the entire sea and make use of all your items and skills. SS just puts roadblocks in your path over, and over, and over.

&gt;[Skyloft] was the only place in the world until the surface was discovered.

I should clarify. By ""Skyloft,"" I meant the sky, not the town itself, which is actually pretty cool.

You could say (in similar tenor to my defense of WW) that, ""it's the sky, of course it's empty,"" but we're talking about a world with floating islands. They could have done so much more.

The sky itself is ""pointless"" in the sense that everything interesting is on the surface, not in the clouds. You have to traverse the sky to go anywhere interesting, making it a middle man.

Again, you could accuse me of talking out of both sides of my mouth because you have to cross WW's vast ocean to go anywhere meaningful, to which I add:

* WW has warp, but SS doesn't.

* WW has vehicle improvement, but SS doesn't.

* WW has vehicular combat, but SS doesn't.

* WW's vehicle actually talks, is important to the story, has a name, and a personality, but SS's doesn't.

The sky and the sea are quite similar, but no matter how you measure it, WW wins. Period.

&gt;Most of the squares have things in them like .... Sure there are pieces of hearts spread here and there, but there's a lot of water.

Now who's being reductionist?

First, submarines and platforms are not islands. There's 49 islands, 20 platforms, and 7 submarines, so you've only strengthened my argument.

Second, out of 49 islands, 19 have heart pieces, 6 are dungeons, 3 are mini-dungeons, 4 are towns, 4 are fairy fountains which give you items, 7 are mini-games, and the rest are miscellany and treasure.

Third, are you seriously complaining that a seafaring adventure game puts a lot of emphasis on treasure? Seriously?

&gt;SS has better and more *true* dungeons.

WW has [7 dungeons](http://zeldawiki.org/Dungeons_in_The_Wind_Waker). SS has [7 dungeons](http://zeldawiki.org/Dungeons_in_Skyward_Sword). They're all ""true"" dungeons. You cannot hope to sustain this argument.

And concerning mini-dungeons, WW has 3 while SS has 2, so you've shot yourself in the foot. Again.

&gt;Forsaken Fortress? Jesus that's practically a hub in itself since you have to go to it 3 times.

Again, *fucking priceless* coming from someone defending SS, which is entirely premised on revisiting the same 3 regions again, and again, and again.

&gt;Ganon's Tower you just redo smaller versions of the previous dungeons

You mean just like Sky Keep in SS? Or Hyrule Castle in OoT? Or the Moon in MM? Give me a break.

&gt;dungeons in WW were incredibly easy

Of average difficulty, I'd say.

Big difference is, in SS, you have rudimentary level design combined with Bluetits McUseless recapping *every goddamn thing every goddamn second* and treating you like an autistic goldfish.

&gt;it sounds like you didn't do much exploring in SS

I 100%ed it twice, five years ago.

Haven't been motivated to go back.

You didn't even address its spartan map and hollow overworld.

&gt;you simply went into SS wanting to hate it.

I cosplayed red tunic Link at my local GameStop's premier, I preordered and paid off the special edition months in advance, I bought the hardcover guide, and even framed the cloth map.

I wanted *so badly* to love SS. It has a couple things going for it (great visuals, great controls, great music), but it disappoints on nearly every level.

You, on the other hand, have this antagonistic attitude to WW I can't fathom. It's a flawed game, but it's magnitudes better than SS, your defense of which is flimsy.

&gt;Sorry but you're not in the majority with your opinion here.
