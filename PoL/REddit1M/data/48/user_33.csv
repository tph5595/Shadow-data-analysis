16325,"Summed up my feelings exactly. I really encourage everyone that is a Zelda fan to play the game. It has a great story and does a lot really well. It just has a few flaws (Fi, empty over world, disconnected zones, linear, Fi, revisiting the same areas, Fi) that keep it from being one of my top Zelda games. "

Groose went from total douche canoe that I absolutely hated to becoming arguably my favorite character in the series (only real competition is Midna). Fi wasn't that bad as a character, it was a game design flaw having her constantly telling you what each material was whenever you got one after starting the game again, but since she was the one telling me every damn time she gets the hatred."
