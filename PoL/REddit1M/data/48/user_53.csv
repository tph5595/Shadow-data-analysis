41803,Such an amazing dungeon. TP has what I consider some of the best and worst dungeons in the series together
75723,"The Forest and Fire dungeons. They felt like they were just going through the paces. Very bland by the books dungeons.

Likewise the Temple of Time and the City in the Sky were just very dissapointing.

The Temple of Time just felt like a collection of leftover puzzles from the Tower of the Gods, and ""City in the Sky"" was just a pile of grey blocks and a floor textured to look like sky.

On the other hand; the Arbiter's Grounds and Snow Dungeon were just amazing, full of flavor and originality.

I also enjoyed the Water Dungeon quite a bit."
