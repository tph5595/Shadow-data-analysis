8969,"I still think the Lanayru Mines from Skyward Sword is the most unique dungeon in the series. It's just so... lush yet cold and mechanical. The Sandship from SS was pretty cool, too.

  edit: Actually.. I thought most of the dungeon designs in SS were incredible. The Ancient Cistern is just so damn cool and its boss, Koloktos, is one of the most fun bosses in the entire series in my opinion."
48760,"Awful characters? Groose is the best character in the franchise. Him and his hair. And Ghirahim was one of the most interesting villains. Actually... Which characters did you think we're awful? Because everyone on Skyloft had a great personality and almost all of them were pretty memorable. 

  Also Zelda fans don't care about a lack of dungeons or empty overworld if it's The Wind Waker I've noticed... "
69280,Not if it's as empty and boring looking as Skyrim.
69383,"I wanted Groose in Smash so bad. And Hyrule Warriors.

  Fuck it, I want a [Legend of Groose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yNDH0FiL5M) game."
88939,"Wow, okay. I'll take this a bit at a time.

  &gt;He's the Donald Trump of Legend of Zelda.

  That's ridiculous and reductive. I'm guessing you ignored Groose's character development (basically the first person in the entire series to get such a thing)? How he is actually *integral in Link even saving the world*?

  &gt;Ghirahim has this homoerotic overtone and pseudo David Bowie thing going on, but it doesn't work. He's just weird for the sake of being weird. There's nothing to him except that he's effeminate and creepy.

  He was unique. Not bright, not at all movitvated outside of a cultist attitude.. but then, technically.. neither was Dagoth Ur in Morrowind. But just being can be interesting and entertaining.. both of which Ghirahim was. He *owned* the Ziggy Stardust from Hell attitude and aesthetic. And I'm sorry you feel the Zelda series doesn't need more unique characters with actual emotions and development like him and Groose.

  &gt;As for a lack of dungeons and an empty overworld, Wind Waker is different.

  Why? Because there's this strange attraction to The Wind Waker on the internet? TWW is incomplete, empty, and rushed with a tacked on fetch quest at the end for padding.

  &gt;In SS, you have Skyloft which serves as a pointless hub. 

  Except for the fact that, as a major part of the game's story, it was the only place in the world until the surface was discovered. And you have an armorer, potion maker, fortune teller, side quests, mini games, and a whole dungeon in Skyloft so I don't see how it's ""pointless"".

  &gt;In Wind Waker, the Great Seas is the world. You have a 7x7 map with islands in each square. You have to do a lot of tedious sailing, but there's a direct tradeoff between travel and exploration, since each square has an island, with unique things to do and see. 

  Having just recently replayed The Wind Waker, I can tell you this is an outright lie. Most of the squares have things in them like submarines with chests full of rupees, or islands with a chest with rupees, or platforms with enemies and rupees, or a cave with.. *gasp!* you guessed it: Rupees! Sure there are pieces of hearts spread here and there, but there's a *lot* of water. It was a clever loading screen for the hardware at the time, nothing more.

  &gt;And in WWHD, you can get the quick sail, which makes it even better.
  
  So you can see texture pop-in and slow loading and bad draw distance because the Ocean was a giant loading screen because the game wasn't designed to have you sail that quickly! Hooray! The Swift Sail just shows the original flaw in the design: tedium. TWW:HD is slightly less tedious and they greatly reduced the triforce fetch quest, but it's still tedious and it's still a clearly incomplete game (Aonuma even said so).

  &gt;Concerning dungeons, WW and SS both have 7 dungeons, and both have been criticized for it.

  Yes, never said TWW had more dungeons, but SS has *better* and more *true dungeons*. Half of the dungeons in TWW are more like the Ice Caverns in OoT. And Forsaken Fortress? Jesus that's practically a hub in itself since you have to go to it 3 times. And Ganon's Tower you just redo smaller versions of the previous dungeons.

  &gt;People aren't as harsh towards WW because the dungeons aren't as insultingly easy as the ones in SS. 

  Again, having played TWW recently I have to call BS on this one. The dungeons in TWW were incredibly easy.. partly due to being rushed.

  &gt;you expect a hell of a lot more from SS, like all its empty spots would fill in, but they never do.

  Not sure what to say here except it sounds like you didn't do much exploring in SS. There are a ton of easter eggs, secrets, hearts, chests (in the Sky and on the Surface) if you go off the beaten path.

  &gt; It's underdeveloped, and expects you to just love it for being Zelda.

  That's The Wind Waker, not Skyward Sword. Sorry but I just don't agree with anything you've said and it seems to me you simply went into SS wanting to hate it. I mean.. Groose is one of the most widely loved characters in the entire franchise and yet you think he's Donald Trump? Sorry but you're not in the majority with your opinion here. nothing wrong with that, but don't tout it as fact.

158363,"I love The Wind Waker, I'm not hating on it at all. I'm simply pointing out the fact that is was incomplete and had actual problems within the game design.

  edit: You can point out flaws in a game and still enjoy the game greatly. Planescape: Torment has one of the worst combat systems in all of gaming but the writing, the characters, and the world all make up for it."
163751,"EVERY Zelda game has mixed feelings until the next one comes out lol. Since OoT at least. All hail the Zelda Cycle lol. 

  Heh. It's funny.. Your feelings on SS are mine on TWW. I just can't get over the incompleteness of the game. It's the only Zelda game to date that was rushed to the point of missing content. "
170336,"You think SS is incomplete? In what way? They released it as a full, complete game while Aonuma has admitted on several occasions the Wind Waker is missing a lot of content, most of which ending up in TP."
