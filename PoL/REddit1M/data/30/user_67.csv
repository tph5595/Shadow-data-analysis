25268,"Speculation on hard mode:

Gotta eat to stay alive and/or replenish stamina (and maybe standing stamina regen would be much slower). Maybe drink water too. Gotta sleep to avoid being exhausted. No bonus hearts/stamina. Reduced HUD. No targeting reticle on bows. Holding a drawn bow eats stamina. Reduced heart recovery for certain/all recipes. No health bar on enemies.

Again, pure speculation, but those all seem like they would be perfectly valid hardmode items."

Cold Water: Swimming in cold water will lower your body heat and cause you to take damage. Cooked food and special garb won't help you."

Zora was my first area too, and this was my first Lynel, but I still fought him and won without dying. Protips:

This would be a good way to practice Perfect Dodges or Perfect Parrys. So save your game right before engaging so you can keep at it if need be. Dodging will earn you a Flurry Rush, and Parrying will earn you an opening to mount that sumbitch and whack him in the back of the head a few times.

As best as I can tell, Horsey McLionFace (at least at this point in the game as a red) has 5 distinct attacks.

1. Slash with sword at close range. Usually 2 slashes at a time.
2. Use both hands to try to grab you
3. Charge at you with his sword
4. Charge at you on all fours (sixes...?) and try to headbutt you
5. Flaming burps

On both of the close range attacks, a Dodge and Flurry is your best bet. Backflip all day err day, sidejump won't get you out of the line of fire.

On the sword charge, you can peg him in his ugly mug with an arrow if you're a decent shot, and this will stun him for a decent amount of time, enabling you to mount that mofo and give him [a good beating]. If you miss, get your sword/shield out in a hurry and parry or dodge.

On the other charge, he comes a LOT faster than you are probably expecting, so get your Dodge or Parry ready.

On Flaming Heartburn, you can either just keep moving in one direction and sprint a little everytime the fireball comes at you, keep ZL held down and side jump the fireball, or, if you're ballsy, you can actually Shield Parry the fireballs. Oh and bonus jonas, there is now a nice wildfire burning, that you can use to ride your paraglider on an updraft, which you can use to go bullet time on your bow to shoot Cecil in the face.

[Here's a video of a Dark Souls veteran absolutely destroying a silver lynel while wearing underwear, with only three hearts, and taking no damage.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84tCwtytdNk&amp;t=0s) If you felt like you needed a handy combat guide."
