2587,I have an awesome strategy for farming them. You want it?
3262,"Ok. Obviously works best with the full rubber set, the full snowquill set and the full flame breaker set upgraded twice each.

First sleep until night.

Then fast travel to Shai Utoh shrine and run past the stable to the bridge. The Electric Dragon will come down the waterfall and go under the bridge, paraglide over as he is approaching the bridge and use the time slow down to target whatever part you need with your bow.

Next quick travel to Dow Na'eh shrine. Exit the cave to the left of the waterfall. Climb the wall on your left and run over to the valley. Look up at the mountain, and you might have to wait a little. Around midnight the frost Dragon will appear and fly down the valley. Again paraglide over and target what you need. Incidentally, great place to get Star fragments as well. They tend to fall here a lot but you need to grab them before 5am, so you'll miss the fire dragon.

Next quick travel to Shae Loya shrine. Run North past the stable and very slightly West. Again it's a valley you'll see on the map. The fire dragon should already be approaching. Repeat the paraglide, bow trick to farm whatever you need.

Then you can sleep until 9pm again. ðŸ˜Š"

3609,"Not the proximity, the timing. My way, he's always there when I arrive. On those cliffs I found I had to get lucky as to whether he was there"
3714,"Plus your locations are all at midnight, so you have to choose one dragon to farm per day, my way gets all three dragons each day"
3796,"Read what I wrote. You can farm all three dragons in a row, then sleep until night and do it again. So much quicker than one dragon per midnight"
3877,"My circuit means no camping. You sleep until night, farm all three dragons then repeat."
4113,Lynel hunting is definitely my favourite thing to do
4230,Haha yours is the reverse order of mine. 
4490,"""Yeah I just shot you in the face with a toy bow and now I'm riding you naked and beating you with a stick!""

Lynel would probably die of humiliation"
