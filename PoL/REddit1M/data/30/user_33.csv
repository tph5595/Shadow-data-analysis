Here's my tip for the community: learn how to parry. Simple as that. I used to get panicky around guardians and never thought I could figure it out or get the timing right. Just practice a few times. It's worth it. Or just get ancient arrows from Akkala lab. 

One question for the community: anyone have any hints as to the nature of the downloadable content for this game and when it might come out? I'm about 60 hours, 40 shrines, and one divine beast into the game. I wouldn't say the finish line is approaching yet but I am already thinking about he next phase of the adventure. Any info?"

In my opinion, don't spend the money on the warm clothes in Rito village. Use the warm clothes from the old man at the beginning of the game from the old man. 

Go on the circle path around the village and lake on the way to the flight range and get a bunch of spicy peppers. Buy or catch a bunch of warm darner fly things. Cook about 30 mins worth of spicy food and that should do the trick. If you're using a walk through to get through the dungeon, might not even need 30 mins worth. 

This method saved me a lot of money. Those Rito outfits are overpriced and I don't think they look super cool either. I'll stick with my souped up hood and champions tunic for now. "
