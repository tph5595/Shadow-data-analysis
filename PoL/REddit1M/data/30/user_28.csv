Now that I think of it, almost every game I've played does this. Mario games do this, Fire Emblem series does too, the only one I can think of where this doesn't happen is Pokemon after beating Elite Four."

If by normal you mean no more monsters/guardians, then it would be boring because there would be nothing left to fight.

But yeah I do see your point that you just want to see the world happy after all the work you put in. People think that the DLC story in December might be a continuation off of the true ending, so not all hope is lost!"
