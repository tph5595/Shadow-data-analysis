22620,"So, I talked to Fugo (I think that's his name) the Goron about the Igneo Talus at Lake Darmani. I was exploring and happened upon the Igneo Talus, killed it, came back and talked to Fugo and he still just tells me about the Igneo Talus and that someone should kill it. Did I miss something? I went back to the spot and the Talus isn't there since I already killed it, obv. Do I need to just wait till the next blood moon?"
