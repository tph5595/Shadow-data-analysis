11667,The extra storage space is nice.

The guardian ones that you get from shrines are low durability."

 I usually kill their legs first, but thus far there doesn't seem to be a trend of what loot drops one way or the other.  I seem to get cores at about the same (low) rate regardless of how the thing dies. You obviously get more minor parts when you kill their legs first, and I'm pretty certain that you can't get a core from the legs, only the main body."
