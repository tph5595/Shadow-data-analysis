17715,"Do we have any hard data on whether or not killing guardians with Ancient arrows affects the loot drop rate? Anecdotally it really seems like one-shotting them in the eye never results in a big item drop for me. And I don't believe I've ever received an ancient core or giant ancient core from killing one with an arrow. Maybe I've just been unlucky, but the few GACs I have received were dropped when I beat one down with a melee weapon


*** it occurs to me that destroying all the legs first might result in more minor loot. Mainly interested in the cores here"
22405,Has this produced (m)any giant cores for you?
