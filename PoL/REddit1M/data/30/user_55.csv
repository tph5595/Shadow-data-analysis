14435,Kass is exactly the NPC you are looking for.
23159,It sounds like you encountered a different Igneo Talus than the one he wants you to take care of. 
23543,"I just checked, and Fugo wants you to check out Darunia Lake, not Lake Darman. "
27285,"Yeah, you can dip in and out as you please. "
29224,"Not just the same number. The same branch. Make the trees identical.

You can pick them too instead of shooting them."

31293,"The 3DS Virtual Console has quite a few Zelda games. A Link To The Past is probably the most definitive Zelda game in terms of establishing many of the conventions of the series. Mind, BOTW eliminated many of those conventions. 

Also available on the 3DS are Ocarina of Time and Majoras Mask remasters. Those two games were probably the starting points for the vast majority of Zelda fans today. 

You can also play the original Zelda and Zelda II on the virtual console, but they are a little dated. To many people, including myself, they still hold up. Your mileage may vary. 

That all being said, where I would recommend you start is with A Link to the Past, then Ocarina of Time. After that, if you enjoy LttP more, then pick up Link Between Worlds. If you enjoy Ocarina more, then try Majora's Mask. 

All of the games are pretty well loved, and for any of them you could find someone who puts it at the top of them all. You can't really go wrong. "
47766,The different recipes don't matter so much.
51337,"All of the gems are needed for one aspect of the game. I'll leave it at that unless you ask.

You can also pretty comfortably sell gems if it means getting arrows/armor you need or paying for a side quest; late game farming gems becomes somewhat trivial."
53624,Yes.
63879,"Beyond the set bonus that some complete sets offer at 2 stars, the only benefit is increased armor."
81855,Looks like Jump Attack. You can pick it up from the gardener in Kakariko Village at night.
