5594,"Does the world not revert to normal after you beat the game? I completed the main story line last night and now all I have is a star by the save profile but I can still go fight calamity Gannon again. I already saw the memory and credits. I beast calamitys second form. Does the world not change at all if I want to 100% it of atleast try to? I feel like for an open world game, the ending does nothing for me at all. It just says- hey you best it good job now back to the same twisted world you're in even though you just got rid of the evil!- am I missing something? "
6431,Well that sucks. I thought it was going to get easier with the guardians; that's why I waited to do stuff and I only have 11% done
7118,I just thought that the castle would atleast go back to normal
8836,I mean normal by they remove all the weird black and pick crap that surrounds everything. At least convert the castle back to happy
9128,Who said Gannon brought all the enemies? Maybe the guardians would be gone but that's it and I just want hyrule castle happy 
14158,"Yet in one of the memories Zelda talks about how more monsters might be a sign that Gannon is coming back. I don't think Gannon brought the enmities, just resurrected them"
