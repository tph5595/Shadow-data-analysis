2715,"The shrine is like 12 metres away from the house... Like you literally turn left, jump across the ravine, and you're there in less than 10 seconds... You want another warp point?"
3075,"[Stand in these three locations at midnight.](http://imgur.com/3b1etwF)

1. Farosh - The parapet of the south side of the bridge. You can easily glide there from nearby. He flies straight past your face.

2. Naydra - On the cliffs to the south of the road. He flies straight past your face. A bit of a pain to get to, I tend to warp to the top of Lanayru and glide down there. Be aware there is a Lynel just to the east of this location.

3. Dinraal - On the cliffs above the big skeleton. It's a bit of a pain to get to, but once you get there just camp until night and wait. He flies straight past your face."
3139,All the shrines. Kiltons medallions. Koroks. Lynel hunting.
3339,Can you plant them at all? Honestly never knew you could do that? 
3476,He literally flies about 5 metres from your face. No idea how you could conceivably have trouble when he takes up basically the entire screen he's so close.
3565,"It's a little underwhelming, but it's basically 3 free inventory slots for each variation so that's nice. I just wish that rather than a compendium we had a physical museum for Link to store all the things. I'd have so much more fun being able to interact with everything rather than just lame photos."
3746,I just set up camp and waited. Rinse and repeat. Rather than trying to fit it into a real days worth of activities. It's 15 minutes IRL to spawn camp them for every last piece required to max armour.
3910,"In Links house? Yeah it's part of the quest, after buying the house you pay them to install fixtures and repair the place."
4323,"Mine too, though it's getting a bit too easy. I wish there was a simple way to screen record, I think I could make some cool show-off videos to put on youtube but if I have to physically record my TV then that's not going to happen.

I want to 3-heart one, naked, with only Boko bows and a single tree branch."
13953,"You get three medallions from him for killing all of the overworld bosses, one for each variety. Hinox, Talus, Molduga."
43788,You get the parts to upgrade some of your clothing. Plus their weapons which are the best in the game.
45237,"You have to talk to him ""about monsters"". He'll tell you how many you've killed.

And no it doesn't have to be in one cycle, but they have to all be unique kills. You can't have killed the same one twice, that doesn't count."
