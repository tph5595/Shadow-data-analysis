49407,"I mostly use a few basic recipes and just switch out the ingredients depending on what I need. 

I usually do all my extra heart recipes first (just one extra heart ingredient alone) then switch to some combination of meat/fish, mushrooms, and fruit. Sometimes I throw in an herb/spice. And I just switch out the ingredients depending on what effect I want. 


For example, if you want stamina recovery, pick all your stamina recovery items. Like stamella mushroom, bee hive, stamioka bass, etc. 


A lot of people are saying you only need the yellow heart items for recovery, but I don't run into those really often and I don't go looking for them. So I make a variety of things that heal different amounts. 


If you'd like, I can upload the recipe guide from the guide. "
