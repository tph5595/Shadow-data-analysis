2163,So I just bought the house and I'm pretty underwhelmed. Especially because I can't teleport directly to it. People keep talking about having a ton of apples available... Not seeing that either. I even had the guy plant more trees. Am I missing something?
2625,"Yea, I've seen it - but that tree is there regardless of home ownership.  
  The only thing that seems reasonable about it is that it starts the terry town questline"
3320,"It's less of a convenience thing and more of a ""I can warp basically anywhere in Hyrule, but not my house... how does that make sense?"" type of thing. I'll survive (clearly it's not a major issue due to the reasons that you stated but I guess I just made a bad assumption).  
  
It's not like rupees are really hard to come by so it's not a huge deal or anything, but people were making it out to sound like the house was gods gift to man.... and it's really just not. "
3807,I just saw a screenshot of a dinner table. I'm assuming that comes later in a quest? Haven't seen that yet....
