58139,"Is there any way to get regular and mighty lynel gear after all of the lynels in my game have become white/silver? I know about the red lynel by the zora, but he doesn't drop the regular lynel crusher or spear, which I'm missing. I know I can buy the pictures for them but I'd also like to be able to try them out."
