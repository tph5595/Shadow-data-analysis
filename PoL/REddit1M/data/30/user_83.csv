24104,"I kill the legs all the time. Legs have a 0% chance of producing giant cores but they drop minor Ancient junk that you can sell. Destroying the legs also makes guardians trivially easy to kill.

The way I farmed cores for my Ancient Armor was this:

1. Get close to a guardian.
2. Save.
3. Run up, cut its legs with the master sword until they're all broken.
4. Hack away at the body until it dies. If it's about to shoot me, hit it with stasis.
5. If the core drops, yay! Otherwise, reload the save.

Saving/quitting is totally optional but it turns out you can kill every single guardian on the map and only pick up three or four cores. By saving I remove the need to wait for a blood moon.

Anecdotally they drop cores about 1/5 of the time. Giant cores are more like 1/10. Flying ones also drop cores, as do the super turrets that you find in Ganon's castle. Stalkers seem to have the best drop rate though.

Edit: a few more tips:

* Ancient and Guardian weapons do a LOT of bonus damage against Guardians. You can get those easily at Major Tests of Strength. They're good for when the Master Sword is on cooldown.
* Guardians can still drop cores when you hit them with ancient arrows. I don't know if the drop rate changes but it doesn't seem to. I chose to kill them with melee because it only takes a little longer and it's a lot more fun. Plus Ancient Arrows are expensive.
* The Barbarian Armor will let you kill them faster with the Master Sword, but Ancient Armor is better if you're using an Ancient or Guardian weapon.
* You can one-shot the decayed guardians by deflecting their beam back at them. "

40443,Yep. The mini guardians (I think they're called scouts) don't make the master sword glow.
