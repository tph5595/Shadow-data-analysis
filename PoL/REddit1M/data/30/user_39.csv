9467,I just snuck around the monster and got more than 20 shock arrows. There are even some arrows on the trails on the top of the mountain and in the trees. So you don't have to kill it. Zora was my first area I went to So I was also not ready to kill it. 
9589,Use the ice rune if your low on cold resistant gear. 
9687,Go to korok village and there are 3 shrines that you can do there. Each one gives you an ancient core as the treasure.
