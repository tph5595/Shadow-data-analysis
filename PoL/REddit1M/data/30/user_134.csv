66073,Does anyone remember which shrine taught you how to parry/dodge/flurry? I finished all the divine beasts... But I still feel like my combat skills are seriously lacking. I could really use some low key practice on those basic skills. It bugs me that I still can't get through the major tests of strength. I feel like the bosses in the divine beasts are a little too easy.
