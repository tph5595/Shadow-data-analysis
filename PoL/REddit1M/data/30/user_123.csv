49092,"The Ancient Short Sword has a durability of 54, which means it can take 54 standard hits.  Hitting stuff like ores will ""cost"" more hits and hitting Guardians will cost less.

For comparison, Royal Broadswords have a durability of 36.  The only sword more durable is the Scimitar of the Seven with 60.  Standard weapons like these take a bigger hit to their durability vs Guardians though."
