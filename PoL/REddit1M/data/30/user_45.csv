11069,are we able to recall all of link's memories from the start or do some get unlocked over time? i swear i'm in the spot of one but i can't find any glowing spot 
11320,i've unlocked about half so far and have talked to her a few times since. i must just be in the wrong spot 
17450,"does going through the yiga clan hideout or some other event trigger them randomly showing up constantly and everywhere? prior to going to the hideout i had encountered the 'hidden' ones pretending to be a lost person or something but now they're just popping up everywhere, both the ninjas (or whatever they are) and the guards.

32068,ocarina of time is a nintendo select for 3DS and you can usually find it for less than $20. a link between worlds is also on 3DS but it's harder to find and therefore getting pricey. majora's mask is usually around $40 too. if you're most focused on price i'd say ocarina of time and/or virtual console titles
