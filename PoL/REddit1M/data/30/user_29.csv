7269,"How can you get ancient cores?

I've done pretty much everything in the game (except for a ton of koroks that I don't think I'll go for) but I still need 4 more ancient cores (and a lot of other sutff) to upgrade armors. I thought all walking, flying and turret guardians could give regular cores but I ran out of the walking ones (until the next blood moon) so I'm trying with turrets now and they never give me a core :\ is it just bad luck or am I wrong and these simply don't give cores?

edit: got my anserr; the sronger guardian scounts in the test of strenght shrines can produce cores and they also re-spwan with each blood moon :D"
8582,"Yeah, I have done all the shrines and collected all the chests in them though :\"
8634,"Right! the stronger ones sometimes give cores, thanks!"
9968,I have already completed every shrine though
13540,"They don't, I have tested it. I think the ones in the wild do though"
14650,I only spent cores on the armor and getting a single sword required for a sidequest but I need more in order to upgrade that armor precisely. Oddly enough not only I find more sprins/screws/shafts/gears than I need but also giant cores :\ I wish the machine in akala would trade ancient parts xD
32043,"At this point in the game I highly doubt it.. but I don't need the rupees either so I won't be selling, what's that other use?"
32734,"Oh, I know. I already upgraded to the max the torso and pants but the helmet is still a level 2; I need the cores for level 3 but I already have more than the required giant cores for level 4 (asuming it costs the same as the other 2 parts)."
45931,"I found him around Akalla iirc, I don't think he had cores though :\ but I'll get the ones I need from guardian scouts tomorrow"
347568,"I did that before asking but it was taking way more than 2-3 tries :S ended up getting them in shrines though, also took a few retries but each was quicker than killing a guardian."
349004,"Or I got unlucky :|

I kill guardians pretty fast but it's even faster to kill mini guardians  and I can save at 1 step before triggering the miniguardian event while it doesn't matter if I save in front of a walking guardian, upon loading the save it might not be there. And those small diferences, after 30 tries, make a huge difference in time.

I kill regular guardians with the shield parry thing btw"
