3631,"Rito Village itself has Warm Clothes. What I recommend is getting a lot of Spicy Peppers to make some spicy dishes and head straight to Rito Village. There you can buy some clothes to better help against the cold

Although if I recall Hateno Village might sell warm clothes too"
4711,This is true although I don't know how well that applies to the very cold areas
5281,Definitely worth it. They look cool as well
9190,In Kakariko Village there is a suit that the full set really helps you sneak around enemies. Buy the whole set and wear it. Keep out of the Lynel's sight and grab the shock arrows from the trees. Keep your distance and out of sight and you should be fine

10938,This is what I did. /u/dozzinale I recommend stocking up on healing items and just swimming across if you can.
