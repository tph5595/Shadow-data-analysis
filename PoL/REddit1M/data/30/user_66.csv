18209,"yes it does and it's super annoying.

I've been in a staredown with shield drawn against a guardian only to have one pop up and start pelting me with arrows."
18283,"YES!

Create a new profile and start that way. It's very clunky. I don't want my Switch clogged up with multiple profiles that I have to keep track of to know which playthough of which game I want."
18325,"Zeldadungeon has the full map but I don't think they have every solution available.

Having said that, once you know where to look they're almost all insanely easy to find/do."
18366,"Best thing to do is just play the game and every night look toward the mountain. There are only a few places you can be where you won't see the blue glow. When you see it, warp to the nearby shrine, put on your stealth armor and go get it."
18432,"yes

Gerudo town has every kind. 

Kakariko has fire and regular

Hateno has bomb and regular

The southern beach town (forgot the name, starts with an L) has electric and regular."
18547,"Yeah once the quest is activated they're all ready to be found, so if you're there and you don't see the glowing spot to approach, you're in the wrong spot.

Some of the memories will trigger without the spot (like the ones as you do the four beasts) but all the ones in your slate have a glowing spot to clue you in on them."
19060,"Nope, it's just an homage. Climb the tree and the wind picks up.

If you go there at night a buttload of stal monsters will swarm you though."
19170,"In the Rito village itself there is a clothing shop that sells cold gear. A headpiece (looks like feathers), wooly shirt and wooly pants."
19242,"If you want to find Shrines you'll need the cold gear.

Technically you can keep making potions, but it is a better investment to just bite the bullet and buy the outfit, then you won't have to worry about it.

Money is pretty easy to come by."

also grab a hammer and fire armor and just peruse death mountain. Tons of ore to be mined and sold.

Also you can farm the Tallos monsters for ore.

Devote an hour to any of those methods and you can usually walk away with more than enough money to buy whatever you need at the moment."
