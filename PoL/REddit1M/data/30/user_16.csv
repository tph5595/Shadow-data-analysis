3512,"My dragon farming circuit (which I got from guides here on reddit):

At 10 PM I teleport to the shrine next to the Tabantha Great Bridge and stand on the middle of the bridge. Around 10:30-11 you can see Dinraal approaching. I shoot and gather the piece and I'm done by 11:45, 12. At that point I teleport to the Spring of Wisdom and glide west towards the east Lanayru Road/Lanayru Promenade and just wait on one of the side cliffs. Around 1:30 if you turn towards Mount Lanayru you can see Naydra approaching. I gather the piece around 4:30-5 am and I teleport to the shrine behind the waterfall of Riola Spring, swim upwards and stand one of the sides close to the waterfall, usually Farosh spawns around 10 seconds after I've positioned myself. 

When I'm done I just go exploring until it's 10 pm again and repeat &amp;lt;: "

Dropping a rock on top of them helps numb the pain for like a fraction of a second."

18496,Yeah! They give 1~2 screws/gears. I usually destroy all legs first and then go crazy with melee attacks until they poof.
