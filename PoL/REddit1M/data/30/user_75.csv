You can't warp anywhere, only to places already that have Sheikah warp pads set up. This is basically just Sheikah creations like shrines, towers, and the divine beasts, plus the two labs that are specifically working on ancient Sheikah tech. 

You can't warp to villages. You can't warp to ranches. You can't warp to fairy fountains. Not being able to warp to Link's house makes perfect sense to me. 

It *would* be cool if one of the purchasable upgrade was to have Purah install a warp pad at your house, though. "
