3457,"You can find Dinraal at the Eldin Great Skeleton. Stand on the skull and he'll fly down a little after midnight. If you haven't found that it's far north, above death mountain; you can see it on the map if you zoom in.

Farosh can be found at the Lanayru East Gate around midnight, stand on the pillar at the end of the bridge.

And you can find Nayru around midnight at Mount Lanayru. The best way to shoot at it though is to go to the mountain slightly to the west (I think?) and wait for it to fly down. I'm not as sure about this one as I am for the others because I happened upon this one enough to not have to hunt for it."
