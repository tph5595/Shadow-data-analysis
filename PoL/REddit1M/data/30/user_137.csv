There are quite a few ways/locations to farm loads of Luminous Ore or Amber every moon cycle, depending on where you dove off to from the plateau. If you have parts like Lizalfos tails, you can dump those into potions and sell the result. You can also roast a bunch of meat (or any food you have on hand that you could spare) and sell them, but you'll be relying even more on your resource management here. 

EDIT: You can also abuse Chu Chu jellies in the same fashion as roasting food. You can get lots of jellies fairly quickly, too."

In theory, it's a dragon bone club with +50 enhancement bonus to damage. Combine that with the tier 2 set bonus, Bone Atk Up, and the result is multiplied by 1.8, resulting in 171 total damage. This can be further increased with tier 3 attack boost from food or elixirs. This is assuming no enemy armor."
80925,Those are the only two instances that I can recall. Won't say any more since I assume you don't want spoilers.
83252,"Attack boost caps at tier 3. The elixir won't stack with full Barbarian.

EDIT: Of course, bone weapons are not as durable as the Savage sets, so that's something to consider. You are also stuck going all-in for attack if you want the optimal damage output with Bone Atk Up. Barbarian armor + Savage + tier 3 defense boost is extremely flexible and nearly omnipotent, for example. This also isn't counting bows or charged attacks. If we were to talk about highest damage value, a bow would normally take the cake at 32*5 (160), assuming all hits connect. Spin attack has a damage multiplier alongside a modest rehit rate, making the attack value on one handed weapons actually more worthwhile than they at first appear. This also isn't counting the critical hit enhancement on melee, which effectively doubles damage output if it works consistently. Not worth mentioning on spears, though."
85379,"Required isn't the word I would use, but yes, everything has a use. It's up to you to decide whether the money is worth more than the potential grind later on if you get fixated on an upgrade or two. Selling what you pick up will be handy, but avoid depleting your entire stock of monster parts.

EDIT: I don't know if you're a completionist, but if you are, then just be sure to keep a high minimum. If you aren't planning to grind anything, then consider focusing on potion selling to optimize monster part value."
87079,"You can find lots of ore around rocky terrain. Look for large hills and  mountains, yes. The desert and its surrounding canyons can be kind of nuts, but obviously not an option if you don't intend on buckling down or are saving that area for last.

SPOILER

Also, there are a number of (sometimes) well concealed rock monsters that drop many valuable rocks. If you don't know where to find one, the first is actually somewhere on the Great Plateau, somewhere straight ahead of the Resurrection Shrine."
87483,"West Necluda? Sometimes the lights take time to appear. You can make them more visible by making it nighttime. If the memory refuses to spawn, then double check with Impa to make sure the quest is still functioning properly.

If all of these things fail, then either you have the wrong place or it's a glitch."
