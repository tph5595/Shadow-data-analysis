22879,I just did this one. Apparently with how the rocks are (can't make ice pillars) you have to just swim. It does 7 1/2 heart damage from the time you jump into the water (from the small boulder on the side where the shrine is on the left side of the screen). There is no food to stop you from taking damage as it freezes over the temp gauge.
