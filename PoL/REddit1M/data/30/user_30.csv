7525,"They are different. White Maned Lynels are weaker. Silver Maned Lynels have more HP and can drop gems as well as their normal loot, and also drop more lightning arrows.

White Maned Lynels (From what I remember) are mostly black with a white mane. Counter intuitivly, Silver-maned lynels are mostly white and have black manes. "
7664,Snow Boots don't increase your cold resistance though.
7739,Yes but the Warm Doublet only has an armor rating of 1 and can't be upgraded. Armor is actually pretty huge in this game so I would recommend getting every peice of upgradable armor you can. The set-bonuses are nice too.
8424,If your in a position to have Silver Lynels spawn you can find one in the Colosseum.
82113,"The other two fairy fountains can actually be discovered by doing a few quests in the area that they are located in. After you complete some of the main story objectives I would highly recommend taking some time to walk around the towns and villages and exploring every nook and cranny for quests. Some quests are only unlocked after finishing some objectives of the main story. 

At least one of those quests can lead you VERY close (But not directly ontop of) to another fountain.

Someone told me that if you put Silent princess into your Sheikah sensor, it's a good way to find the fountains because they pretty much always grow near fountains."
82416,But the armor should not be ignored. I can tank like 5-6 guardian hits before my health gets uncomfortably low with a maxed out armor set.
82563,"Exactly this. I needed a blood moon to happen for a particularly annoying quest. I didn't realize it when I started the quest, but I could have actually completed it immediately. I sat by a fire and waited, and the blood moon passed. I knew I would need another so I went around to a few Mob-camps and spots that swarm with guardians and cleared them all out, then went back to the quest spot and a few nights later I had another blood moon on my hands.

82706,"I wonder, though, if the Savage Lynel Crusher with Damage up (Highest damage up I've seen brings my crusher up to 84 damage on it's own.) With Full Barbarian set and level 3 attack boost elixir might do more damage, no? Not sure how to calc that though."
83289,"If you like that gentle horse, I'd recommend exploring the mountains in the south-central area. There might be something there to ease your mourning.

Just be aware, it looks very much like something it's not."
83460,Killing the Guardian Stalkers (The walking ones) usually drops at least 2 or 3. You can find lots of them right outside Hyrule Castle.
