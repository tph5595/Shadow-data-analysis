26137,"They all have one thing in common though: the imprisoning war. Most of the games set in hyrule in the fallen time-line mention the imprisoning war and Gannon's rise to power. This doesn't happen in the other games in the time line. With Gannon being present in THE BOTW trailer, I am going to assume his humanoid form, Ganondorf is no more, which would fit in the fallen timeline perfectly. My estimate is that this falls immediately after OOT and before a link to the past, if not right before. I believe the koroks exist in this universe because Nintendo has shown they give no fucks about the timeline and its already practically not canon by now. "
26210,Flood only happens in the adult timeline though. This looks fallen timeline to me.
