In most games she was a driving force, always the one to push forward in the fight against Ganon. But here, seeing her have this total breakdown just made me think: ""ok, if even Zelda is losing her shit, things must be going really, really bad"".

This, and the trailer's dramatic tone in general. Just listen to its music."
