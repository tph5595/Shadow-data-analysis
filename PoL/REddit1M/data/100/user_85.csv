Edit: lol how is this downvoted? It's an objective fact. The age of consent is 16 in 31 states, and the most populous states fall into that group, making it the case that a very significant majority of Americans (of any age) can legally have sex with a 16-year-old."
46407,"Uh...because we have no way of objectively measuring one's capacity to give consent in a mature and responsible way. Instead, we use age, which is easily the strongest correlate of that."
48402,"That's a rare thing. In more than half of states, its legal for anyone 16+ to have sex with anyone else."
62478,lol what?  When did I say anything about whether it's moral?  I'm talking about the law.

I'm a psychologist, and that's not how it works.  We don't have tests that examine maturity because maturity is extremely subjective and complex.  It simply isn't something that can be measured.  Besides, who's to say that a particular 16-year-old is mature enough to have sex?  What does it mean to be mature enough to have sex?  There are people in their 30's who engage in reckless sexual behavior and eventually die from it.  Were they mature enough to have sex?  Clearly not.  Could a 15-year-old be mature enough to make responsible decisions about sex and have the emotional resources needed to deal with the potential consequences of sexual behavior.  Who's to say?"

I didn't say that. Does it look like my account name above that comment? I literally said absolutely nothing that wasn't specifically related to age of consent law.  I'm a psychologist, I know all about whether people are emotionally mature enough to have sex. I work with teenage girls.

That's embarrassing as hell, buddy..."
