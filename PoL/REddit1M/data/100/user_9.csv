10337,"I think this Zelda looks A LOT like a teenaged version of OOT's Zelda. It might not be a coincidence. There is a lot of evidence that suggests that this could take place shortly after Ocarina of Time. But then again, there's a lot of evidence that points to the contrary too. No matter how packed each new trailer is, it's continually a headache to try to diagnose where this fits in the story. Nintendo has really done their homework.  
  
Speaking of descendants, I feel like there's a small chance that the Goron we saw could actually be an aged Darunia. He looks extremely similar. Gerudo chick could just be a random new character, but being a descendant of Nabooru certainly isn't out of the question."
