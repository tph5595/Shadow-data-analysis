Next the music, it has been swelling up to that point and pauses for the scene, putting more emphasis on the characters and what they say, or cry in this case. I can't speak for the Japanese dub since I'm not familiar with the cultural norms in their expressions, but Zeldas sobbing in the English version is raw enough to create a duty of care within us, this is a primal feeling which few can withstand. 

The thing that gets me the most is the movement, it feels very human; how Zelda sort of collapses into Links embrace indicates a weight to their relationship and Links reaction shows this as a suprise as well, as if up to this point Zelda had been a more cautious or reserved character; together this indicates a closeness in their relationship that we as the audience love to relate to or feel as though it is our experience since Link is sort of the avatar of the player."
30934,"It's perfectly normal, when someone is purposefully giving you their full-attention, through body language and facial expression (that eye-contact), it shows a weight to your relationship and/or indication of your power over them."
55043,"You getting the wrong implication, when people are sad or crying they usually turn away from other people out of shame or fear of ridicule. By turning to Link (the player), she is showing a sign of trust."
56190,"I agree with you, I'm not talking about why she is experiencing emotion, I'm explaining why someone would show that emotion and expose their vulnerability to someone else.

I don't want to get into the nitty gritty (you could talk about the subject of relationships, expectations and the human condition forever), but generally people you trust have a good degree of power over you.

I was explaining to the other guy that it's ok to feel positive whenever someone expresses despair toward you, because it means that person trusts you enough to expose their vulnerability around you and the feeling of being trusted and relied upon is very endearing.

Second, I am speaking *generally*, so take a step back from LoZ. 


Third, if the way I use the word 'power' is weird to you, then that's your problem not mine, I'm working off a damn good understanding of the English language.

 Fourth, happiness from someone trusting you does not stem from whatever they are trusting you with, whether that be a positive or negative thing.

Fifth, you don't control what you feel! Emotions happen, actions are controlled. It is not selfish to *feel* any particular emotion, however, it is selfish to *act* to better yourself over other people.


Anyway, I hope the people reading this have learned something and have a nice day."
67217,"Look, you clearly have some sort of agenda here. Im just telling it how it is, you are trying to demonise me to fulfill some sort of crusade against supposed misogyny. (You learn a lot about someone's perspective when you sort by controversial and top on their post history) 

I was trying to make someone feel better about themselves, you are trying to tell other people how to think. I was presenting the OP with a different and positive perspective, you are trying to blame me for not seeing it your way.

In your mind, this female character cannot have any sort of human romantic involvement and so must only be motivated by duty and responsibility (something I wasn't arguing against but you kept bringing up). In your mind, 'power' is negative and must be a means of authority and oppression over something, whereas I see it as a neutral term which could be applied to both negative and positive things. 

Do I need to eleaborate why calling someone who you don't know (and who has been relatively respectful for an Internet debate) 'selfish' because my perspective on good and bad feelings is different than yours, a bad thing to do? 


I've enjoyed this conversation but feigned and ironic friendliness (You really shouldn't be proud of that) mixed with toxicity don't make for good arguments.


I admit have assumed many thing above, so forgive me if I've gone too far, but if you want anyone with less patience than I to listen to you, you need to work on that tone.

Also sorry to any readers who were looking for some positive discussion we have stained the positive tone of this thread."
