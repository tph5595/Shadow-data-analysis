47839,"See, I'm still convinced this takes place further down the Wind Waker timeline. The Zora argument falls upon a bad interpretation of Evolution. It's basically the same argument as ""We couldn't have evolved from monkeys because there are still monkeys"". The Rito came from Zoras, but that doesn't mean all the Zoras died out. Even if the evolution was forced by Hyrule Zoras being unable to survive in the Ocean, there are other Zoras in Termina that would have flourished. The Zoras seen in the trailer also look radically different from those in OOT, it's probable that they've evolved a bit as well. There's also a slightly more birdlike Rito seen towards the end of the Trailer. 

My guess is that this takes place some point after Spirit Tracks, after the water has finally receded from Hyrule. This explains how Hyrule returned to nature as we see everywhere in the trailer. The town we see is a new settlement created by Zelda in the hopes of restoring her ancestral homeland. This is sort of supported by Zelda's line in the trailer where she says ""Everything I've done up to now, it was all for nothing"". My guess is that this means the settlement was destroyed by this game's main villain. "

There is a temple-like structure, but it certainly doesn't look like the Temple of Time. Hell, it even looks like it could have spent a couple centuries underwater."
79500,"Okay that's definitely the Temple of Time, but all of the scenery surrounding the Temple of Time in OOT is gone. The temple is still standing, but Hyrule Castle Town has been wiped from existence. Clearly something happened to it. Like, y'know, a massive flood. Considering the magical nature of the temple, it's not unreasonable to think it would be able to survive it's time underwater. "
