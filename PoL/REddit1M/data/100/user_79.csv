45538,"We shouldn't measure the age of consent on... yeah, age... We should measure the *ability of consent* on intelligence and maturity. This Zelda, no matter how old she is, seems to be very mature and determined. Probably because she has already lived a hard and challenging life, different than ""kids"" today.

Extreme, but perfect example:

Why should be sex with a 17 years 364 days old who has an IQ of 150 illegal, but sex with an 18 years old who is almost mentally retarded legal?"
45697,Would it be that bad if she were 17 years and 364 days old? Maturity can't be expressed with age.
49874,Not the point if my argument.
49891,"14 in Germany, where I live."
50067,Because my point were real life ethics.
50974,"But 18 is just a random number, because it's a magical age for many things. It is even different in so many states in the world. It would be tolerable for me if the age of consent had been determined by psychlogical tests. So we could have found out at what age the average of people has reached a certain level of maturity. But this number wouldn't look like 18, 16 or whatever whole number. Maybe it would be 15 years and 339 days, maybe 17 years and 3 days or 16 years and 3 months or even 14 years and 100 days. 18 years is just too dumb. It is only taken because it's a pretty number. But where the feelings and personality of humans are concerned, we should have higher standards than having numbers which are easy to remember."
104652,It wasn't the matter if she is real or not. And it wasn't about waiting a day or not. I wanted to show how random such rules and laws are.
104899,"I get what you mean. But that's not what I wanted to express. I wanted to tell you, that I think that random numbers thrown as laws are not ethical. The whole age of consent thing is an extremely hard problem if you want to solve it in a way where you try to be as ethical as possible. I don't have a solution either to the problem. But this doesn't hinder me from addressing the problem. Maybe others can solve it. I just threw mathematics into the debate."
105249,"I don't know how you got this number, but it doesn't matter. And you don't have to be **fully** developed for sexuality. Just as you need a certain level of maturity (of intelligence or something) to understand or handle mathematics or Heisenberg's uncertainty principle. Or to vote or play video games with violence in them. All these things are independent from each other. And you haven't to be fully developed to understand mathematics - or sexuality. The last 10 years, from 16 to 26 are pretty much nothing more than finishing."
105778,"That's just what I wanted to say. We are not to say. At least not yet. But maybe it will never change. I wanted to address the problem, which I see in using arbitrary numbers are laws. There have to be better solutions. There are. Lumping everyone together is not even tolerable for me. Then it's a bad law, like there are many bad laws all over the world. In certain countries more than in others.

Why should the age of consent be 18 or 16 or whatever? Why this number? Convenience is a bad reason.

I don't want to say ""let's all fuck children"". Just in case, someone would accuse me of that. I want personalized treatments in such cases. Because every human is different. And those who are far ahead of others don't deserve inhibitions."
105863,What do you mean?
138450,"I know that children need protection and I am not denying that. But I think that the current protection is imperfect. Instead of accepting it without questioning it, we should strive for something better. It would be foolish to call today's situations perfect - no matter in which topic.

I'm sorry for a certain missunderstanding, maybe I didn't express myself good enough:

I'm **not** speaking from the older people's perspective. My arguments shall advocate those adolescents who are far ahead of other individuals of their age. I'm speaking from their perspective. My goal isn't making it easier for old horny men to have sex with even younger people. I want to extend the rights of those young people who are the mental elite of our society. They are adults in their heads when they aren't by law. They are mature and intelligent enough to decide on their own, years before normal people can do it at the same level. I myself belong to the top 2% of the population in terms of IQ. I don't want to swagger, but I am telling it to you, so you can understand why this topic is important for me.

That's probably the reason why I said that there is only a small difference between ages 16-26. (I'm 21 now.) Because I have always felt mentally superior to the most others in my age. Not that I've ever wanted a sexual relationship with someone much older. And that's not even my point for this topic. I want more freedom for people from the mental elite.

To get back to the beginning; obviously Zelda is part of such an elite. Not because she is royal, but because she seems to be very mature, because she has probably had a serious life. And because she is the heroine of the game.

Edit: about which Zelda are we talking? I meant BotW-Zelda, not the one from OoT. I fear that I didn't speak about the Zelda every other spoke about."
146287,"Not all brains are exactly the same. That's not true.

&gt; In fact, that feeling of being ""more adult"" than peers your age is one of the hallmarks of not being an adult

I know what you mean. But that's not what I meant. I began very early to be interested in philosophy, physics and mathematics (my true love for mathematics is why I hate using such magical numbers like 18 for laws). The others were inferior. Their superficiality and lack of morals annoyed me since I was five. (Back then I used to constantly argue with teachers and other parents in the preschool, because I thought and think that the it's nothing more than morally fucked up to lie to children about Santa Claus. Instead of stories about Santa Claus, I listened to my uncle when he told me about quarks and gravity. When my mother told me religious stories, I wanted to pray for Satan, because I found his banishment unjust.) I **WAS** superior to them in many aspects, in some others not.

Of course there is an elite. Not every human is the same in terms of its mental abilities. There are different kinds of intelligence, for example emotional intelligence.

And please, stop telling me to not fuck 16 years olds. I haven't wanted to do. And how many times must I explain my motivation until you have understood it? My goal is not the older people can decide whom they fuck. I want the younger mental elite to be allowed to choose more freely, without risking persecution.

Tell me, what you think maturity is. I think it is a level of one's mental abilities where the person should be independent because he is fully responsible."
508087,"Just as they are people who are mentally retarded, others are very fast developing.

You know that I didn't want to speek about geeks.

So what you want to tell me is that we cannot measure intelligence? And that all tests are shit because some people wanted to be the elite? Nice conspiracy theories.

Why should the 6574th day of your life be a magical day, where you suddenly achieve the abilty to consent? The fucking 6574th rotation of your planet in your lifetime makes you an adult? What the fuck? That's what I mean with random. There is no connection to the topic of adulthood. Maturity has nothing to do with how many times our planet could rotate. When would a settler from Earth on Mars become an adult?

Everytime others want to decide for another person, the person who cannot decide on their own wants to achieve freedom. That's natural. No matter if it is an absolute monarchy, Nazi Germany or parents. Don't get me wrong. I don't want to say that parents are tyrants. The process of striving for freedom is natural. And doesn't this mark the transition from childhood to adulthood?

Your argument is so out of place. It reminds me of a report on TV I saw many years ago. The topic was the question if videogames can make teenagers violent. The mother of a gamer said that she is sure that her child is addicted to gaming, just because of the fact that the child **denies** being addicted. She didn't mean denying when you **are** in fact addicted, just as many alcoholics do. She literally said and meant that her child is addicted because it denied its mother's accusations. This is what you do, when you say something like:

&gt; This is another thing that young, immature people think - that being protected is a form of persecution.

Yes. Maturity is a process. I know that. But even in processes or natural distributions you can choose certain points which you can define as a border for something. Normal distributions and inflexion points, for example. And that was kind of the spirit of what I wanted to tell you. Somewhen in the process of maturing, a person reaches a critical point - and that point is different for every individual - which we could define as their age of consent. Not the xth number of rotations of one's planet. I know that there is a huge problem. How could one measure that point? I don't know. But **this problem** should not discourage anyone to address that our current situation isn't problem-free.

And let me tell you that you are an extreme pain to speak to. You're constantly mocking me, trying to make me look like a pedophile or like an immature kid. I don't think that you are immature. But you are a superficial.

TL;DR of what I wanted to tell you:
I question that the **abilty of consent** *magically comes* with a certain day, which is the *same for everyone* (for example: 18 years old=age of consent; one day before 18th birthday=illegal). The **18th birthday** as something more important than the **17th** or the **19th birthday** or even the **6000th day in one's life** is *nothing more than a social construct*. Therefore *I refuse accepting it* as a meaningful indicator, because that age is only used as the age of consent because it's a pretty number which is easy to remember. Such oversimplification is *not acceptable* for me, because *it cannot do justice to an indivual*, as **every person is diffent in their (mental) development**. A standardized date for everyone *inhibits those who are developing faster* and *fails to protect those who are developing slower*. Maturity doesn't come with the dawn of a certain day, but with experience, intelligence, wisdom, profundity and determination. I cannot offer a perfect solution to the problem. But I can address the problem, so that many others start to think about how we can create a better situation. A humane solution to this problem must be a complicated one. But every **fair treatment is worth the difficulties**. The same can be said for age restriction of games, movies, etc. The same can be said for everything using a set date which acts as a magical age of becoming able to deal with something. In this thread someone said something like that Zelda from Breath of the Wild shouldn't be seen as a sexual subject, because she seems to be under 18. I simply questioned that magical date, which isn't directly connected to real maturity in any way, by saying that BotW's Zelda is probably far ahead of her peers in terms of mental abilities, just by what we can theorize, about how she has lived. She has probably lived a serious and hard life full of dangers, which presupposes a higher-than-average level of maturity and intelligence, which is also normal for every protagonist of any fiction, because mentally superior characters are cooler and more interesting. Additionally she is royal, which suggests that she should be above average in terms of education, just because she has more money. (I don't want to tell you that it's fair that the rich are better educated, but sadly it's a fact that the poor are worse educated on average.) The second article of the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany is something whose spirit is just what I want to achieve. Everyone should have the right to free development of his personality. In my country the situation isn't a perfect solution, but a lot better than America's oversimplifying and lazy way of dealing with it. By the way: I don't want that horny 50 years olds can fuck with every 15 years olds. That's not my goal. I think of a ""Zelda"" around that age who is in love with a 20 or even a bit older ""Link"".

Please, let's end it here, unless you are able to discuss like a mature with me."
512227,"Legal positivism is the worst moral a person can have. It stands for stagnation, indoctrination, superficiality and immaturity in the sense of not being able to decide on your own. An aspect of the pure evil, the same that made Nazis or Islamistic terrorism possible. And a bit like the Calamity Ganon.

A fallacy of yours is that you insist on the age of 26 of being the true age of maturity. You don't have to be fully developed in every single part of your brain to make certain decisions on your own. With 18 years your brain is on such a high level, that you CAN do such decisions. And not only since that day.

&gt; Well, Zelda is older than Link more frequently than she is younger, if my memory doesn't deceive me.

Absolutely not relevant.

&gt; You continue to do an excellent job of demonstrating how mature you are.

Pointing out how immature I am is sooo mature, right?"
515499,"Hahaha, oh God.

You started to call me immature. You aren't immature, but you acted like an immature on purpose to mock me. That's just mean, not immature.

You **did** support legal positivism with what you said. And sorry, that **is** my eternal enemy. Otherwise I wouldn't have written down my concerns for this topic. Every law, moral or justiciable, should be constantly under the fire of criticism. Otherwise our laws become outdated and stay imperfect. The Sharia is an extreme example for that. Just like with the evolution of species, our laws can only become better on a large scale, if we try to make them better. And the best is trying to make as many people happy as possible. We won't get far with standardized age restrictions. Not only for sex. I think the bigger problem with age restrictions are restrictions for video games. Not only that they are the results of an outdated view of children's ability to deal with certain things, but also that they are standardized. It prevents so many young people from diving into the beautiful and complex world of fantasy of games like Skyrim, for example. When I was 12, our school class wasn't able to watch the third Harry Potter movie (in Germany rated as 12+), because two children were 11 and their parents didn't want to allow them to watch the movie. That's not protection, that's overprotection, legal positivism and ""uncriticism"" at its best."
516539,"I don't know what I can say now. I have said everything I can. Now we both have a good view of the other's opinion, I think. Of course you can ask more, if you want. I'm satisfied now."
