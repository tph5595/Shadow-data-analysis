43090,"In the WW timeline, they form New Hyrule. Even if the flood receded, they would have no reason to go back to Hyrule."
97736,"For New Hyrule to not be formed, the split would realistically have to be before Wind Waker (A split between WW and PH would make no sense since they're weeks apart at most, and between PH and ST would make no sense because there's no games there). There's no games between Wind Waker and OoT, so unless they add another branch after OoT (Adult + no flood?) New Hyrule will always have been formed after the flood"
136137,Ohhhhhh. That could be an interesting split
