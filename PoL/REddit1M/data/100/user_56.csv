Personally, I think it's going to end with the flooding of Hyrule and the sealing of Ganon, which will eventually lead to the events of Wind Waker. This game will not end with the defeat of Ganon. At least not as (temporarily) final as in other games. I think at best, it ends with Link leaving the Master Sword in Hyrule Castle for WW Link to later find, and just barely escaping before the Sages seal it away. At worst, he doesn't make it out, but his actions still save everyone including Zelda."

Maybe it was done in anticipation, and maybe we see exactly that happening over the course of this game."

If I'm right in my BotW theory, that line could still be true ""from a certain point of view"" (to borrow from Kenobi). I'm curious, if anyone has access to the original Japanese line, whether it explicitly implies a causal relationship between the flood and their transformation, or if it could be read either way..."
