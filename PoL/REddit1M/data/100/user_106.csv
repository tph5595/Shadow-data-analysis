53998,"It's much more likely that she looks sad because Castle Town was destroyed and a bunch of people were killed, not because she just loves Link so much."
54201,"I didn't see it that way at all. But then, I watched the Japanese version. I hated the English version, it sucked in comparison.

In the Japanese version, it's not at all about Zelda just being so sad and you need to take care of her/your relationship is so important. It's the tragedy of a leader whose people have been decimated, who she can't protect. Zelda crying out in that scene is the howling despair of all of Hyrule.

Edit: Which, btw, leads into the symbolism of her collapsing in Link's arms - Link is the hero who will save Hyrule (and the world) from oblivion."
55379,"Well duh, but you didn't say it that way. You said she was giving you her full attention showing the ""weight"" of your relationship/your ""power"" over them.

She's not. Yes, to show emotion in front of someone you have to trust them, but Zelda is not giving you her full attention, there is no indication of the weight of a relationship or having influence over her because she just cares about you so much or whatever. She's not thinking about you/Link, that's irrelevant to her in this moment. Her mind is on Hyrule, exclusively. She *symbolizes* all of Hyrule, she is Hyrule's Princess, she is the descendant of Hylia - the patron goddess of Hyrule, you have to save her (and Hyrule) in practically every game, she helps you defeat whoever is threatening Hyrule in practically every game. To be enthralled by the romantic or relationship implications in this moment is shallow fangirling and waives away the *story* significance. There is vastly more depth to all of Zelda's expressive scenes than how waifu she is."
56085,"Yeah. It's super cool for a 50 year old man to fuck a 16 year old, who is legally a child in all 50 states even where it is also the age of consent. As long as you're not going to prison for it, it's not immoral.

Like cheating on your spouse, say."
56174,"Bro. She does not look 30 years old. She doesn't look like a child by any means, she's a cartoon whose rendered simple enough to have an ambiguous age anywhere in the late teens to mid twenties. But 30? You're crazy."
56339,"If you are in a position where you need to judge whether or not someone has the ability to consent, you shouldn't be fucking them. And you are actively demonstrating the fact that there is a major power discrepancy between the two of you by being the one who gets to determine whether or not the relationship is morally sound based on your own judgement of the other person's character."
56385,We know at what age people's minds have fully developed/graduated from adolescence. It's 26.
56781,"You're missing what I'm saying. *Her mind is exclusively on Hyrule.* As long as she's not *scared* of you or actively dislikes you (which is a degree of trust), she's not going to bother masking her emotions.

I'm not saying that seeing someone emotional/make eye contact doesn't make you like them a lot more. I'm saying that the analysis here is shit. She's not concerned with a single individual seeing her cry, her mind is completely elsewhere.

&gt;but generally people you trust have a good degree of power over you.

You use the word power in a really weird way. I'm assuming you mean like influence? Usually this means something like, they won't move away if you won't move with them, or, they'll change their habits if they really bother you. All that kind of shit is irrelevant. You *wouldn't* be able to influence a single thing she does or wants to do, because she is solely focused on Hyrule and determined to save it. Your individual concerns are irrelevant to her.

And anyway, being pleased that someone trusts you is not at all the same as feeling happy when they are despairing. To feel happy when someone you know is deeply hurt because of what it means for your relationship is selfish."
58086,"Early fifties??? I don't even believe you. Assuming you have the ability to see, and that you wear glasses or contact lenses if your eyesight isn't very good, then you know the difference between a face with wrinkles and without. How old are you? The only time I have ever not known the difference between 50 and 19 was when I was like, 6 and didn't yet grasp the concept of age.

Edit: Oh, and you're implying here that you can tell the difference between men in their early fifties versus late teens, just not women. Did you actually mean that? Because that makes exactly 0 sense."
58255,"&gt;First, we don't know what Zelda's character is going to be like in BotW, so open your mind a little. Ok?

We know what Zelda represents *series wide,* and we know from the trailer that she is focused on Hyrule from her dialogue.
(Edit: In fact, there isn't a single game where Zelda's love for Link take precedence over her determination to save Hyrule. Please see SS, where she manipulates him in order to save Hyrule.)

&gt;Third, if the way I use the word 'power' is weird to you, then that's your problem not mine, I'm working off a damn good understanding of the English language.

You're really not. ""Power"" usually connotes authority. It *can* mean influence, in some contexts.

&gt;Fifth, you don't control what you feel! Emotions happen, actions are controlled. It is not selfish to feel any particular emotion, however, it is selfish to act to better yourself over other people.

Emotions are a response to information filtered through our perspective of the world. You can't control them in the moment that they occur, but you can control your perspective and thus change how you feel about things. If someone you care about is *in despair,* and your emotional response is happiness, you are selfish. Period. There's no way around it, friend."
64396,"No, you're not. You asked, ""Would it be bad if she were 17 and 364 days old?"" You are expressly asking if it's bad."
65784,"You can try to pretend all you like that you were exclusively talking about the law, but that's bullshit and you know it.

&gt; Would it be that bad if she were 17 years and 364 days old? Maturity can't be expressed with age.

That's what you said. Are you sure about that? Are you really, truly sure that maturity cannot be expressed with age, at all? How about age 5? Does that say anything about maturity?

This is the nature of moral decision making. There are decisions you know are moral or amoral, there are decisions you know are immoral, and there are decisions you don't know are moral/amoral/immoral. Which is to say, there is a grey area.

Now, if we were all being good people when it comes to deciding who is old enough to fuck, we wouldn't venture into the grey at all. But the law has to allow for more flexibility, because it puts people in prison. Which is to say that with things like the age of consent, the law aims for dark grey. Do you understand?

It's some cute trickery, to try to make the age of consent sound arbitrary because a single day separates a person from one age to the next, but the truth is that the law allows plenty of wiggle room. The law allows days and days, if not years, of room in the ""grey.""

You're welcome for making you a better person.
"
68202,"&gt;(You learn a lot about someone's perspective when you sort by controversial and top on their post history)

Lol. I'm not hiding it.

&gt;I was trying to make someone feel better about themselves, you are trying to tell other people how to think. I was presenting the OP with a different and positive perspective, you are trying to blame me for not seeing it your way.

You can think whatever you want. It's a matter of fact that if you're happy when someone you care about is in distress, you are selfish, by definition.

&gt;In your mind, this female character cannot have any sort of human romantic involvement and so must only be motivated by duty and responsibility (something I wasn't arguing against but you kept bringing up).

I never said that. Link and Zelda are my OTP lol. I just give the developers a little more credit, which everyone should, since they have never prioritized a romance over the truly meaningful symbolism and story of the Zelda series.

&gt;Do I need to eleaborate why calling someone who you don't know (and who has been relatively respectful for an Internet debate) 'selfish' because my perspective on good and bad feelings is different than yours, a bad thing to do?

It isn't. I'm not saying you're selfish. I'm not even saying the OP is selfish. I think OP probably just didn't think through their wording very well. And I think you are trying to defend something that you wouldn't feel. I imagine very, very few people are inspired to feel happiness when their loved ones are hurt, it's not a natural reaction unless you don't actually care about them very much.

&gt;I've enjoyed this conversation but feigned and ironic friendliness (You really shouldn't be proud of that) mixed with toxicity don't make for good arguments.

I think intellectual dishonesty doesn't make for good arguments. Like when you think it's OK to feel positively about the fact that someone you care about trusts you enough to be vulnerable around you, so you defend something completely different - feeling *happy* when someone you care for is deeply hurt because of what it means for your relationship.

&gt;I admit have assumed many thing above, so forgive me if I've gone too far, but if you want anyone with less patience than I to listen to you, you need to work on that tone.

LOL. I really don't care who listens to me. Your perspective is your responsibility. I'm just stating facts here, for those who are mature enough to accept facts about how things work in real life, regardless how they are delivered.

&gt;Also sorry to any readers who were looking for some positive discussion we have stained the positive tone of this thread.

:("
69217,"Oh, whoops! You're right, you were just stating facts!

So let's go over this then.

Somebody said Zelda looks at least 18, suggesting that they think this age is old enough not to constitute pedophilia if someone is attracted to her. They make no reference to the law.

Somebody else responds, asking if 17 years and 364 days is all that different from 18/stating that age has nothing to do with maturity. They make no reference to laws.

The first person responds asking why you can't wait a day. They still haven't actually mentioned the law, but assuming they are referring to it, they are obviously referring to laws that *do* state that 18 is the age of consent. It's probable that they concur that this is a good age of consent and think people should generally subscribe to it, including those who live in places where the age of consent is younger.

Then you come in.

&gt;You don't need to wait a day. Age of consent is 16 in most states.

Wow. What a great contribution, to a discussion that isn't about the law/what is technically legal. So-and-so wants to know why you couldn't wait a day for 18, which has been established, in this conversation, as a solid age for consent. Somehow, ""there are places where 16 is the age of consent tho"" is relevant here *without* the intention of providing support to the commenter who wants to delegitimize 18 as a solid age of consent.

Sorry, I guess I just assumed no one was oblivious and boring enough to make a completely useless, random, non-contribution here."
70262,"I'm talking about the emotion/acting, not the words. I cannot understand Japanese, no."
129287,"No it couldn't lol. None of those women look 19, nobody would mistake any of those women for 19.

And btw... pictures of actresses are not the same thing as real people? Actresses get plastic surgery and botox, actresses' photos are routinely &amp; extremely photoshopped. Btw Anna Torv looks 35 in that photo. Emma Watson looks 24 in that photo. Vanna White is the only one who doesn't look her age, and let me promise you, that picture is shopped.

None of those women look the same age. Zelda could be Emma Watson's age. That's it. Believe it or not, when developers create a character, they design them to convey their age. She would have a longer face, smaller eyes, she'd be taller, etc., if she was 30. You don't have to go, ""Gee, she's a cartoon character, theoretically it's possible that the developers just didn't add any indications that she's older and just made her without wrinkles and with large, round features which are based on children's anatomy because they didn't feel like bothering."" That's not how art happens.

Like please try to tell me that you can't tell that your 55 year old female neighbor isn't 19. Please. I want to hear you admit to this."
129648,"Yeah, definitely. I just don't see someone crying that gently when hundreds of people have been murdered. But if you think of Zelda as someone who is more composed/emotionally reserved, then it makes sense."
130017,"They're not random numbers. The age of consent is determined by the lawmakers perception of an age that is already not OK. That is, because the law can put people in prison, it errs on the side of 'not OK' for these kinda of things. 18 might seem random in the sense that a day's difference can determine whether you go to prison, but it is not random in the sense that it is picked specifically to give you lots of wiggle room as is. Years of wiggle room. The point of it is simply that an age *must* be specified because yes, there are ages where there is *no question* that it is rape, no matter how mature the rapist claims they're victim to be. In fact, no matter how mature the victim is for their age, because maturity is not the same as life experience and it is not the same as power.

So when a gown up fucks someone one day younger than 18, they are taking advantage of a great deal of courtesy that has been allowed, and willfully violating a law that is *necessary* to protect children. The one day difference is the difference between someone who doesn't undermine the viability and legitimacy of having an age of consent and someone who does. As you are demonstrating, by trying to delegitimize having an age of consent. Do you see why that is a big deal? We HAVE to have an age of consent. We *have* to. We need one to protect children."
130161,"&gt;The last 10 years, from 16 to 26 are pretty much nothing more than finishing.

I'm sorry but that is absurd. The height of adolescence is 16 to 19. Meaning when the mind is undergoing its biggest changes, when it is most susceptible to influence, etc. This is dangerous rhetoric. And maturity is not the same as power.

Edit: Oh, and I got that number (and the 16 to 19 as the height of adolescence) from the psychological and neurological studies that have been performed in order to figure out who should be treated as an adolescent in psychology and who should be treated as an adult, because we already know the differences in how adolescents' brains work mean they need to be treated differently to be effective. I should think you understand the significance there, in terms of how adults should treat adolescents. Yeah."
142863,"&gt;They are adults in their heads when they aren't by law. They are mature and intelligent enough to decide on their own, years before normal people can do it at the same level. I myself belong to the top 2% of the population in terms of IQ. I don't want to swagger, but I am telling it to you, so you can understand why this topic is important for me.

No. They're not. They might seem that way, but they're not. This is something we know, from neurological testing. All adolescents' brains are adolescents' brains. (Edit: In fact, that feeling of being ""more adult"" than peers your age is one of the hallmarks of not being an adult.)

&gt;Because I have always felt mentally superior to the most others in my age.

That has literally nothing to do with consent. You're talking about feeling more intelligent or caring about more important things, maybe not engaging in drama as much, as your peers. These things have nothing to do with emotional maturity or having an adult brain.

There is no elite. The fact that you think you are elite or that there is a ""class"" of elites like this does not make you or your argument look good. You are clearly not as mature as you believe.

And please. Don't fuck any 16 year olds you have determined to be ""elite."" You're too old for them now. That's how quickly and how much the brain changes through adolescence. You are already too old for them, even the ""mature"" ones.

I really don't think people like you know what maturity is. Maturity, emotional or otherwise, is not feeling the ""right"" things, having the ""right"" reactions, being calmer, etc. That is not what maturity is. That's what children and adolescents think maturity is, because they have a shallow conception of it, *because they are not mature.*"
149093,"&gt;Not all brains are exactly the same. That's not true.

I didn't say ""exactly"" the same. I said all adolescents' have adolescent brains. That is true.

&gt;I began very early to be interested in philosophy, physics and mathematics (my true love for mathematics is why I hate using such magical numbers like 18 for laws). The others were inferior. Their superficiality and lack of morals annoyed me since I was five.

Yeah, this is exactly what I was talking about. I know that philosophy and physics and math are amped up to be something that ""elite,"" ""intelligent,"" ""mature,"" people care about, but in truth it doesn't mean anything about your intelligence. There are plenty of math and science and philosophy ""geeks"" who are some of the most immature people you will ever meet (and even the dumbest), and they always claim to feel just like you - knowing that others are ""inferior"" from a young age.

&gt;(Back then I used to constantly argue with teachers and other parents in the preschool, because I thought and think that the it's nothing more than morally fucked up to lie to children about Santa Claus. Instead of stories about Santa Claus, I listened to my uncle when he told me about quarks and gravity. When my mother told me religious stories, I wanted to pray for Satan, because I found his banishment unjust.)

This says nothing about whether you are elite.

&gt;Of course there is an elite. Not every human is the same in terms of its mental abilities. There are different kinds of intelligence, for example emotional intelligence.

No, there isn't an elite. This concept was made up by people in positions of power and wealth to justify their fortunes. Intelligence as we understand it is a social construct, which is why IQ tests can't tell us anything, which is why they're being phased out by the most up to date psychologists. If intelligence was something we hadn't made up, we'd be able to measure it accurately, and that measurement would be able to predict things about people.

&gt;I want the younger mental elite to be allowed to choose more freely, without risking persecution.

They aren't persecuted, they are protected. The grown ups fucking them are the ones who are persecuted. This is another thing that young, immature people think - that being protected is a form of persecution. ""Why can't you let me make my own decisions???"" The law doesn't prevent young people from making any choices. It prevents adults from making choices.

&gt;Tell me, what you think maturity is. I think it is a level of one's mental abilities where the person should be independent because he is fully responsible.

Maturity is not a ""level of one's mental abilities."" There are a few different kinds of maturity, the first being physiological. If your brain isn't fully matured, then you are not fully matured. No matter how much philosophy you read, or how good your grades are.

Another kind is life experience. As intelligent as you might think you are, experience bestows wisdom. Wisdom is not intelligence. You could be right about absolutely everything, and still be unwise.

Lastly is perspective. This is something you can only gain with experience. It's also why people get confused about what maturity is, because everybody thinks they're perspective is ""correct,"" or that because it is possible for young people and old people to agree, that their perspective is the same. But opinion isn't the same as perspective. Perspective is the context through which you view the world, and this context is defined by experiences. If you and I agree on all things, but you are much older than me and have much more experience, you are working with more information than I am. The fact that we agree means nothing, because you have *resources* that I don't with which to approach the world. This is what matters when it comes to how you treat other people, not how many things they ""get right.""

The definition is in the word. ""To mature."" It's not a quality you either have or you don't. It is a process of becoming."
510723,"&gt;So what you want to tell me is that we cannot measure intelligence? And that all tests are shit because some people wanted to be the elite? Nice conspiracy theories.

They're not conspiracy theories. It's a matter of historical fact that the aristocracy has shaped culture to value their own traits and dismiss the peasant class. We can trace back the concept of intelligence as we know it today, and the emergent cultural trend to value intelligence, to the advent of mercantilism and the rising merchant class - people who were, or whose ancestors were, peasants, uplifting their status through wealth accumulation.

And no, we can't measure intelligence. Which is why the most up-to-date psychologists don't use IQ tests anymore. IQ tests got their start with social Darwinism. That's also not a conspiracy theory, it's a historical fact.

&gt;Why should the 6574th day of your life be a magical day, where you suddenly achieve the abilty to consent?

Remember this?:

&gt;They're not random numbers. The age of consent is determined by the lawmakers perception of an age that is already not OK. That is, because the law can put people in prison, it errs on the side of 'not OK' for these kinda of things. 18 might seem random in the sense that a day's difference can determine whether you go to prison, but it is not random in the sense that it is picked specifically to give you lots of wiggle room as is. Years of wiggle room. The point of it is simply that an age must be specified because yes, there are ages where there is no question that it is rape, no matter how mature the rapist claims they're victim to be. In fact, no matter how mature the victim is for their age, because maturity is not the same as life experience and it is not the same as power.

18 in particular is often chosen as the age of consent because it is also the day people legally become adults.

&gt;And doesn't this mark the transition from childhood to adulthood?

No, it marks the point at which children transition into adolescents.

&gt;Everytime others want to decide for another person, the person who cannot decide on their own wants to achieve freedom.

&gt;The mother of a gamer said that she is sure that her child is addicted to gaming, just because of the fact that the child denies being addicted.

Yet again, imprisoning someone else for fucking an adolescent does not persecute adolescents. It doesn't make any decisions for the adolescent. The adolescent can fuck as many adults as they like, the law can't touch them. That isn't persecution, my friend. It just isn't. Immature people insist upon reframing protection as persecution because they can't stand the idea that they are not an adult.

What you're trying to say is that if I were to say that I'm sure adolescents are not adults because they claim to be adults, then that would be like the mother who insists her child is addicted to video games because they claim not to be.

&gt;Somewhen in the process of maturing, a person reaches a critical point - and that point is different for every individual - which we could define as their age of consent.

Yup. And that point, in all people, is over the age of 18. Like I said, the law errs on the side of ""already not OK."" And like I said, the age at which people's brains mature out of adolescence is 26. This kind of fast-maturing person you're talking about *will* be in their 20s before they reach this point. *Like I said,* the height of adolescence is 16-19. There are no 17 year olds who have reached this theoretical consent-level maturity.

&gt;How could one measure that point? I don't know. But this problem should not discourage anyone to address that our current situation isn't problem-free.

Our current situation is problem-free, because we already know from studying our brains that, as a species, all 17 year olds are not adults.

&gt;The 18th birthday as something more important than the 17th or the 19th birthday

It's important because it's the law. Would it be a problem if the lawful age of consent was 18 and 1 day or 17 and 364 days? Nope. But because it's the law, and because it's already in the ""dark grey,"" people who insist that the law is therefore arbitrary are dangerous. They're dangerous because we *have to have a law that definitively states an age of consent.* When people like you insist that it's arbitrary and problematic, you undermine the idea of such a law. People who break the law must be punished appropriately in order to maintain the legitimacy of the law.

&gt;it cannot do justice to an indivual,

Only because 18 is an already-not-OK age, meaning people older than 18 are not protected by age of consent laws even though they should be. But this is necessary to avoid imprisoning people unnecessarily.

&gt;I simply questioned that magical date, which isn't directly connected to real maturity in any way,

It is, actually. 18 is the age at which people are legal adults, which comes with a great deal more power than those who are even one day younger.

&gt;BotW's Zelda is probably far ahead of her peers in terms of mental abilities,

Irrelevant. Mental abilities have nothing to do with maturity. Mentally disabled adults are often more mature and wise than mentally typical adolescents. You need to drop the ""mental abilities,"" schtick. You sound like a super villain.

&gt;Additionally she is royal, which suggests that she should be above average in terms of education,

Education has nothing to do with maturity.

&gt;(I don't want to tell you that it's fair that the rich are better educated, but sadly it's a fact that the poor are worse educated on average.)

And yet the poor are not less mature.

&gt;I think of a ""Zelda"" around that age who is in love with a 20 or even a bit older ""Link"".

Well, Zelda is older than Link more frequently than she is younger, if my memory doesn't deceive me. At any rate, the majority of consent laws allow for certain differentials. A 20 year old Link would be allowed, by law in the vast majority of places, to have a relationship with a 17 year old Zelda.

&gt;Please, let's end it here, unless you are able to discuss like a mature with me.

You continue to do an excellent job of demonstrating how mature you are."
513020,"&gt;Pointing out how immature I am is sooo mature, right?

That is literally what you just said. What I was commenting on. You said to end the conversation *unless* I am *able* to discuss like a mature [person] with you. You were accusing me of being immature, and also passive aggressively suggesting that I ""surrender"" the discussion if I don't measure up to your judged standards of maturity. What's next? A bored yawn?

&gt;Legal positivism is the worst moral a person can have. It stands for stagnation, indoctrination, superficiality and immaturity in the sense of not being able to decide on your own. An aspect of the pure evil, the same that made Nazis or Islamistic terrorism possible. And a bit like the Calamity Ganon.

Nothing that I said constitutes legal positivism, but the fact that you are indirectly comparing me to the Nazis, terrorists, and a fictional incarnation of evil itself, is really incredible. I suppose if I were to say that this is, again, an excellent demonstration of your level of maturity, you would roll your eyes like someone who is just so exhausted of me and my silliness?"
515774,"&gt;Every law, moral or justiciable, should be constantly under the fire of criticism.

Dude, seriously? Thinking that a single law shouldn't be criticized in a specific way is not legal positivism.

&gt;if we try to make them better. 

If you criticize laws in such a way that you undermine a good thing, necessarily leading to a worse thing, then you necessarily fail at this.

&gt;We won't get far with standardized age restrictions.

And yet.

&gt;I think the bigger problem with age restrictions are restrictions for video games. Not only that they are the results of an outdated view of children's ability to deal with certain things, but also that they are standardized. It prevents so many young people from diving into the beautiful and complex world of fantasy of games like Skyrim, for example. When I was 12, our school class wasn't able to watch the third Harry Potter movie (in Germany rated as 12+), because two children were 11 and their parents didn't want to allow them to watch the movie. That's not protection, that's overprotection, legal positivism and ""uncriticism"" at its best.

This makes no sense. The law doesn't prevent children from watching movies or playing video games, their parents do. That's not legal positivism. That has nothing to do with the law. What are you talking about?"
