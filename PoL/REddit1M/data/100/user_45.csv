Capturing Link would grant him the Triforce of Courage (though I don't think he knew that Link would get it). But Zelda would be far gone by then and she was the only one threatening his position. So Ganondorf just watched Link until he found Zelda and captured her that very moment. 

The problem with this plan was that Ganondorf underestimated Link thinking noone could defeat the wielder of the Triforce of power."
