32531,"Tbh i like the dress in OOT much more. 
At least she looks like a princess. 

Zelda in Breath of the Wild looks like the average adventurer, not very royal. 
I know she looks badass but it really takes away from the royal atmoshpere of zelda in OOT. 

Heck, I would even get nervous when I was about the meet the ""princess"" in OOT xD Now we're just gonna meet a tomboy :/"
59002,"&gt;royality to me is in more her pose and bearing and she still has that gentile elegance and grace

She didn't strike me as such. The determination, hope and strength of the classical Zelda is no more. Instead we have a cry-baby. 

&gt; than every girl in modern western society is a tomboy.

They are - compared to medieval times. Zelda is supposed to be a ""medieval princess"" and Link a medieval knight. You can't compare them to today but they should at least wear proper clothes for their time. I think it looks out of place wearing tight clothes for a princess in Zelda's world. 

&gt;Your description makes her seem like Old Lara Croft from your comments...

That's the problem, she wears like Lara Croft instead of how a classical royal princess ought to wear. 

When we first discover Zelda in OOT there was a royal atmosphere all around her. Even if you were to see OOT zelda in an old barn you would still know she is royalty. This one? Not so much. "
60361,"It's both clothes and personality. At the very least you should be able to identify her as royalty. Say some sort of crown or whatever. A triforce necklace perhaps. There's nothing. You're never going to feel like you're talking to a royal princess with her around. 

&gt;how is crying being a cry-baby?

Not just that. Look at her face. Her eyes show a ""weak"" , confused and undetermined personality. Compare her eyes to that of zelda OOT which show determination and strength. "
61492,"oh come on. Whatever happened to the ""poor adventurer becoming best friends with the kind, noble princess"" theme. It just isn't Zelda. Sure its a great story still, but it just isn't Zelda. 

Zelda BOTW won't be the same cult game that zelda OOT/MM turned out to be. I can gurantee that already. And that's a shame. 

I hope Nintendo drops making consoles altogether and instead focus on game developing. It'd be the bomb."
62463,"WW is NOT a cult classic. Ask anyone around the world about ""Zelda"" and they will remember OOT. Most won't even have heard of WW. 

Nintendo's lineup + the overall reactions from people (not just the nintendo fanbase) tells me the Switch will meet the same fate as the Wii U: https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/5nw5qu/did_the_switch_presentation_make_you_want_a/"
63223,"idk man i just feel like nintendo is taking a wrong turn. I don't feel nostalgia about games nowadays. 

Maybe i'm just growing old (24). But I wish Nintendo would team up with studio Ghibli and give us something we will remember forever. They tried to do it with BOTW. They need someone like Ghibli's Miyazaki to write a story for them. Hopefully BOTW will prove me wrong."
74157,"I hope you're right... But I can't shake off my head what Nintendo could have done for BOTW if their console was much more powerful. BOTW could have looked 3x more awesome, a live Ghibli movie! "
74757,"Good point, but i think it's unlikely. She'll probably rule as the princess of the land towards the end of the game."
