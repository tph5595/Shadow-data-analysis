13037,"Is BOTW being an OOT sequel a growing theory?  I just watched the trailer again and there is a line where someone says something like ""you finally remember me, I need to tell you what happened 100 years ago"", when that line is said, it shows the great deku tree.  Is there a chance that is the great Deku Tree talking to Link?  If so, is this the Hero of Time talking to the sprout Deku Tree that is born during OOT?"
