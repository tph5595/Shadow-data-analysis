55713,"&gt;which also takes place 100 years after OoT

No, it takes place far longer than 100 years after OoT. So long, in fact, that nearly everybody has completely forgotten about Hyrule. It's a fading myth. Ancient Hylian (which was spoken in OoT) is now a dead language. The race of Hylians (pointed-eared people) is all but extinct. That doesn't happen in just 100 years.

And Jesus Christ, the thing with the evolving Zora's being sketchy. This is explained in the damn game - they were forcibly evolved via Valoo's magic. It's the same thing that happened with the Kokiri. It wasn't a gradual process. There's nothing sketchy about it. People need to stop complaining about that. Even if they *didn't* explain that, it's pretty obvious."
55866,It's not. He made that up. Hyrule Historia even says it takes place hundred**s** of years after. So long that the race of Hylians is nearly extinct and the language spoken across Hyrule is now dead. People don't even remember the kingdom as a real place.
