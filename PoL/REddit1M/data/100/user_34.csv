24761,"Who was that voice at the very, very end of the trailer? I'm positive I'm completely misinterpreting it, but it almost sounded like it could be Navi? I don't even know why I'm thinking it's her because I've only ever played the English versions where she says ""Hey, listen!"", but it made me think it was her for whatever reason.

Edit: Now that I've seen the English trailer, I take that back. Still, I wonder if it could be a great fairy at the fairy fountain or something like that?"
