16269,"so here's the deal.

Deku tree appears in OOT and Wind waker, which is an OOT sequel.

It CAN'T be the wind waker deku tree, because in that timeline the Zoras evolved into the Rito, and here we see Zoras.  We also see the ORIGINAL OOT temple of time clear as day, which would have been washed away in the wind waker flood.

My bet is OOT sequel, following the FALLEN timeline, where the hero fails and starts the timeline including link to the past and the original nes games"
16454,"there are Zoras in this trailer. where were they in wind waker?

Also there's the ORIGINAL temple of time from OOT. How do you explain that?"
25708,"I don't think they're Rito.

Koroks doesn't worry me. They just evolve whatever timeline we go down."
25899,"if this is pre-flood it's even more reason this can't be wind waker timeline. What's the deal with Ganondorf under your theory?? WW ganondorf is remembering OOT Link and Zelda and exacting his revenge on them. There hasn't been a whole saga in between where he's interacted with ANOTHER Link and Zelda, TWICE, before WW kicks off.

35900,do sea zoras even exist anywhere outside Termina..?
36211,"I don't think zelda gets that detailed with their in-game continuity. They'll do something that makes some kind of sense with the least in-depth analysis.

It may well be wind waker. But that seems to ret-con spirit tracks etc.

My bet is fallen timeline purely because it plugs a hole in their continuity at the moment now they actually really appreciate the timeline alongside the fans


that or some kind of timeline unification thing. One of the two. There are definite features there from all three.


The presence of the OOT temple of time EXACTLY replicated is the giveaway for me.
"
71805,"then where were they in wind waker?

I still don't buy wind waker timeline. It retcons phantom hourglass and spirit tracks.

and I still haven't heard any explanation for the fact the OOT temple of time is sitting *right there* clear as day, not washed away in any flood and not dissolved and bubbled away by the King's Triforce wish."
71905,how do you explain the OOT temple of time? the ruins of the original hyrule that was supposedly a) washed away in the flood and b) dissolved by the king's wish?
73447,"check all the other gameplay footage so far.

[here](https://www.google.com.au/search?q=breath+of+the+wild+temple+of+time&amp;espv=2&amp;biw=1366&amp;bih=638&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiF-7fg3sLRAhVEVbwKHZIGAykQ_AUIBigB) is what it looks like. It exactly replicates the appearance of the temple of time in OOT"
86050,"guardians ripped the rest apart. There's dead guardians in the area still and that's the plotline of the game. It wasn't a flood

and regardless, The king of hyrule wished away old hyrule and created a new one at the end of WW"
