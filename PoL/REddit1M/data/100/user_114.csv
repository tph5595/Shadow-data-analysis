63831,I never understood why the Zoras evolved into ritos. I would think the Zoras would thrive now that the world is covered in water.

64458,"It doesn't really look like she is royalty in this game. The opening line in the trailer is ""The history of the royal family of Hyrule is also the history of the Calamity Ganon."" We also see that it looks like Hyrule castle has been overrun by this ""Calamity Ganon"". So I don't think there will be a kingdom or royal family in this game.

In Oot and Wind Waker, when Ganon seized Hyrule Castle, Zelda turned into a tomboy and adventured around to help link, just like we see here.

Honestly I think it's better to have Zelda as an adventurer, fighting along your side, than to have her just stand around and be another target for Ganon. I think it gives her more depth."
