2150,There is such a sense of childlike hope and wonder and gentle passion yet a weariness and wisdom of an elder!
58170,"I don't think so she looks more regal in Adventurer clothes than Princess Peach ever will, royality to me is in more her pose and bearing and she still has that gentile elegance and grace. Plus who says she won't done a more traditional dress in game, all we've seen is the trailer.

Also she doesn't seem tomboyish at all, (If being a Tomboy is not wearing a dress than every girl in modern western society is a tomboy.) She seems very sensitive, gentile, and spirited and in touch with her emotions, if anything she is archetype female temperament. Compare to Ocarina of Time when Princess Zelda's Alter ego was Sheik. If anything this portrayal feels MORE Feminine than OOT. Plus we get to see her lovely feminine figure in those adventure clothes. Your description makes her seem like Old Lara Croft from your comments..."
58243,Thank You!
59843,"In the game The Kingdom is in ruins, so there is an instory justification for her not first being found in a castle and not wearing a dress in the wilderness.

I'm sorry if she didn't strike you as such, and how is crying being a cry-baby? Are you saying people aren't allowed to cry.

You lost me the moment you compared her to old Lara Croft, and Last I checked Medieval times didn't have robots and ~~tablets~~ sheika slates. Nor did they in other games have hookshots, trains, mountable birds, etc. Why does Zelda need to ""look"" royal 24/7 when she seems more or less a fugitive on the run, even in OOT when Ganon took over she was disguised as Sheik, And once again do you really think say Princess Peach looks more royal than this Zelda? Your idea of royalty seems to be 100% based on clothing that shows status of wealth. Seems rather superficial."
61158,"I've seen her eyes....they look pretty strong to me, I don't know what about them is weak.

And I don't see why she has to look royal...in real life there is no such thing as ""looking royal"" beyond some agreed upon symbol for nobility dependent on culture."
62277,"She is still a kind and noble Princess because whether your royal or not doesn't depend on your clothing...Also in Skyward Sword she wasn't a Princess but I guess you'd say that is part of why the game was garbage.

Also plenty of Zelda games don't even have Princess Zelda and their still considered Zelda.

And you can't say that right now or even shortly after it launches because we can't know for sure until later down the line, WW is know seen as a cult classic despite when it came out and before people tearing it apart due to it's art style and a certain fishing for Triforce quest."
62589,"Well a lot of people that know about OOT Won't Know MM.

And FYI the N64 Also didn't sell well compared to it's competition OOT is well known for pioneering 3D Action-Adventures."
63825,"To be Honest everything about Breathe of Wild Looks like something people will remember forever.

And Ocarina of Time for many people was their first Zelda title and they may not be familiar with the 2D ones until later, by the same Token Breathe of the Wild might be fondly remembered as such by the current generation.

And yeah all your complaints seem to be sounding like ""It's not like past Zelda games"" when that has been the point, to basically other than the general open-world game design of Zelda 1, it's a reinvention of Zelda. Just because you don't like it or it's different doesn't mean anything about whether or not it's a classic. 

As for nostalgia about games nowadays, is that a bad thing? Are games only good if they pander to your nostalgia days? Can you enjoy a game without any connection or context to past games? I personally often get sick of Nintendo milking Nostalgia like a Mad Cow and it comes across as pandering and lazy half-assed attempts at capturing a certain audience. (Like how many people feel about Fan-Service.)

For the record I was never impressed by OOT Zelda until the Second Half of the game. 

Funny you should mention Ghibli because I actually felt a Ghibli Vibe watching the new trailer, and recently saw the theater reshowing of Princess Mononoke.

Basically everything you want BOTW to be but fear it's not going to be, is the exact vibe I'm getting from it.

The only real worry I have is how they are going to combine this traditional narrative and cinematic story telling from the latest trailer with the promise of how open world they want it to feel without the two getting in each other's way."
74302,"Oh well that is a bit more of an understandable complaint, but the power of their console rather has nothing to do with the design and character direction of Zelda....and it being on a more powerful console wouldn't necessarily make it ""Classic"" material.

And in the past Zelda games have had limitations, OOT had the whole catridge vs disk fiasco.

TBH I want all consoles to die and everyone play on PC."
160859,Well she kind of has both an old soul and a childish idealism in her eyes.
