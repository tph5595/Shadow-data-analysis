60628,"The update data and DLC aren't ""literally the entire game."""
60662,I think that requires a profile with a different location setting
62896,"Right, so download the BotW software and DLC. That's the update data and DLC, which you need to play the DLC."
63302,"The reward for the Trial of the Sword actually does literally nothing for the final dungeon, because the final dungeon awakens the Master Sword anyway.

The Trial is meant to be a fun challenge on its own, mostly. And of course if you're mid-game its reward is awesome"
63371,"If you delete a save file, of course that file's Hero's Path will be deleted. The new file you're overwriting the old one with would have its own new path"
63878,"The ~433 MB update data and DLC aren't ""the entire game."" The entire game would be 13 GB. Why would you have to download the entire 13 GB game when it's already on the cartridge?"
64207,What's your BotW version #?
64770,Press +/- on your BotW cartridge icon on the home screen. What version # is the game at?
64890,"That doesn't answer my question. I asked, ""What's your BotW version #?"" When you boot up the cartridge, I mean"
67021,"And in the game, what happens when you select the ""DLC"" option from the main menu or pause menu?"
67548,"In-game it doesn't say ""Downloaded DLC?""

Honestly no clue then, contact Nintendo customer support. I didn't get what the problem was earlier because I didn't realize you bought the game twice. If space was the issue, why did you re-buy the game physically instead of just getting a nice microSD card to increase the space on your Switch?"
68746,"Well yeah the DLC download functions properly for everyone else as far as I know, but I've never come across someone who bought both the digital and physical version of BotW which seems to be where the weirdness comes from"
104602,"All the DLC content is optional and can be tackled along your journey. One of the new armor pieces can kind of break the game, but that's the only concern I'd have."
105074,"The timeline can store 200 hours of overworld exploration, and the little white markers divide the bar into 32 segments, so each segment is 6h15m of overworld exploration. Or alternatively, every 4 segments is 25h of overworld exploration"
136041,"IMO, Majora's Mask. It combines the effects of all four Kilton masks, and you can get it as soon as you have the paraglider. Countless monster camps and tough encounters are comprised of nothing but Bokoblins, Moblins, and Lizalfos, all of which don't attack if you have Majora's Mask equipped."
140706,Probably the owl sound effect. Sadly you can't find any owls. Well except for one
202640,"&gt; Anyone else at 82/83 for side quests cleared?

Can't really help you without more information. Find a sidequest list online and compare your list to it

&gt; I also have the botw armor set but have 41/42 shrine quests done...

There are shrines that you can find before taking the quest for them. Again, compare your list to an online shrine quest list"
202847,"This is actually something that's recently been sort of tested, but I can't find the link. Sentry Bokoblins (and Lizalfos?), or maybe just all enemies with bows, seem to take more damage from arrows. I look forward to seeing someone test this in more detail

/u/HylianAngel seems to be the resident data guy"
204567,Well there we go. Thanks my man
205687,No problem my man
276468,"No, you can just go get the quest from the quest-giver and it will immediately complete"
279125,You can get multiples
279162,"She's looking for equipment in the Royal Guard's series (black), not the Royal series (gold)."
279224,"As far as I know the rank of Bokoblins, Moblins, and Lizalfos doesn't matter and they're all fooled equally by the masks"
279243,As far as I know they're the Hylian Trousers
318046,"Oh, that's weird, I have a feeling the shield should work. Maybe she only wants to see one of the three melee weapons?"
320128,"Yes, the expansion is only available digitally"
320182,"&gt; Is it already well-known that you can slow-mo arrow a Lynel in the back of the head several times while you're in the air from getting bucked off it?

I've seen it discussed a little here and a few videos of people doing it, but yeah not everybody thinks to do it"
320259,Not quite an answer to your question (sorry) but I can say with confidence that BotW is playable completely standalone without any need for prior knowledge of the series. Generally that's how it is with Zelda games
320312,The elite enemies category opens up after destroying Ganon
360660,"My method is parry-&gt;headshot-&gt;melee combo-&gt;mount-&gt;mid-dismount headshot, it's fun"
372679,"Oh, that's happening consistently? That's something I haven't noticed then, cool"
399108,You can do the fight with Flurry Rushes and bows alone
492522,23 floors including 3 rest areas
492629,"&gt; Do the Champions' powers always have reduced cooldown times in Hyrule Castle?

Yup, even before the recent update"
575244,"- Some dogs don't have treasure.
- You can use more affordable food like apples, it doesn't need to be meat.
- It only takes 3-5 apples. If you feed a dog more than 5 and it doesn't start trotting somewhere, it doesn't have treasure.
- If you still care about wasting the apples, save your game before feeding a dog so if it doesn't have treasure you can load the game.
- Don't hurt the doggo"
