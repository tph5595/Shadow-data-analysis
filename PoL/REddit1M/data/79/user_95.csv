For some reason I feel the need to find them all, when with most games I do the bare minimum to get the story.

Must be I really like this game!

Anyway, any tips to finish all the Shrines? "

I know this is cheating but I'd like to have a backup if I get frustrated. 

And, I'd still enjoy playing that way. :)"
