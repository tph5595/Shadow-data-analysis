197615,Anyone else at 82/83 for side quests cleared? I also have the botw armor set but have 41/42 shrine quests done...
205589,"OK, I have all 120 shrines complete and no active shrine quests available. I'll heed you're advice for the side quests, I didn't want to list every single one I has completed haha. 

Edit: ah, I see what you mean for the shrines. I'll do the same for them. Thank you!"
