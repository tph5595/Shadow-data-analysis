7726,Okay. So don't worry about pushing it with your leaf. Focus on killing the bow Bokoblins. The wind will carry you where you need to go. Make sure to move when an arrow is coming your way. Then use a Korok leaf on the guys on the platforms to push them off the ledge and die. The Moblin is hardest but doable.
