103832,"I just started BOTW 4 days ago and have yet to reach Kakariko Village for the first time. I have a code for the DLC expansion that I got as part of my bundle. Should I go ahead and download it, or wait until I'm further along? 

My understanding is that everything beyond chests with armor and masks is optional. Is that the case?"
104919,Thanks! I think I'll go ahead and download it. I'd like to be able to get that Korok Mask.
