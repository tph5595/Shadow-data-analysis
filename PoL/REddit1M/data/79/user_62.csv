Other than that, it's a matter of practice, trial and error. You'll get the hang of it. Also, you'll eventually find higher ranged bows — the higher the bow's range, the further the arrow will fly before curving, making aiming much easier.

EDIT: Corrected stronger to more ranged — as pointed out below, some weaker bows do have excellent range."

264489,I've noticed that silver enemies see through Majora's Mask pretty quickly and start attacking you (much like Lynels will eventually attack even if you're wearing the Lynel mask). Has anyone else noticed this?
370507,"Yeah, they definitely get fooled initially. But if I hang around for a while, the higher-ranked (silver and maybe black) baddies eventually wise up to me and start attacking. This hasn't happened in camps of, say, red and blue bokos, where they remain fooled and I can hang around as much as I want.

I don't even have a weapon drawn when they attack, either."
457401,"Yeah, try it out. It's a neat touch, though it does kinda throw a wrench in my plans to use the mask to avoid battles in Master Mode (though I should point out I've only tested this in Normal Mode)."
519227,"Very true, thanks for correcting me.

So, OP, as u/BoopTheBopper pointed out, there *are* bows that are easier to fire, but you'll come across them later (I'm guessing that you're not very far in if you're still getting the hang of aiming). Usually, however, these bows are weaker (especially the ""sniper"" bows like the phrenic and golden bows) — but the trade off may be worth it if you're still having trouble aiming by the time you get them.

Eventually, though, you will find bows that are both strong AND have very high ranges (they practically shoot in a straight line). I won't spoil anything for you, but I will suggest that you hang on to any guardian parts you come across (which is a good idea regardless, for a few different reasons)."
