129409,"How good is the pro controller? I can't aim with bow and arrows consistently well enough (want to shoot Lynel faces so much), but am reluctant to pay the price of a ""proper"" controller, fearing it isn't worth the price. I appreciate any opinion, thanks

Edit: asking how good may be broad so let me specify; Does the joystick of the pro controller make your aiming much more comfortable than that of the joycons?"
