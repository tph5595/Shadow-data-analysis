36670,"How do I actually access Master Mode? Does it show up on the main menu or?

EDIT: Nevermind. I bought a physical copy of the game to free up some memory on my Switch and uninstalled the game. In order to play the DLC I need to redownload literally the entire game because it is impossible to download just the DLC alone."
61175,"In the re-download section on the Switch eShop my options are

""ARMS Global Testpunch

Software

Splatoon 2 Global Testfire

Software

The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild

Software and DLC""

Each of those has only 1 re-download button."

63567,It says that it has already been purchased.
63664,"The issue is that I have a physical copy now to free up memory on my switch. There doesn't seem to be an option to download just the DLC, making my physical copy useless because it is forcing me to re-download the entire game."
64635,Because the 13GB is linked to the DLC. If I uninstall the digital game and play on the cartridge the DLC is not available. If I play on the digital game it is. There is no option to only install the DLC. The only available option is to re-install the digital copy and the DLC.
64738,"I have the DLC working, but only when the digital version is installed. If I un-install the digital version it un-installs the DLC too. When I go into the eshop to re-install the DLC, the only option it gives me is to re-install the entire game + the DLC. It won't let me just re-install the DLC alone unless I am completely missing an option somewhere."
66667,Ver. 1.3.0 when I use the cartridge. I was playing the DLC a minute ago and still have the save data for it and the eshop says I have already purchased the DLC.
66698,Version 1.3.0.
67397,"When I open the eShop from the DLC option it indicates that the expansion pass has been purchased and gives me no option to download the DLC. When I exit it says ""Once purchased content is downloaded, you must close The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. Restart to enjoy your DLC!"" After restarting I still get the same menu as usual."
68269,"Yeah. That's the plan tomorrow when they are open again. Mixture of things. First off is just that I originally wanted the physical copy, but I wasn't able to get it at the time because my local stores were stupid stock wise and I was too impatient to wait for it in the mail. Second, is that I just want the case for the sake of having a hard case. I wouldn't have bothered if I had known this would be an issue. I expected the DLC to function like the 3DS, Wii U, and literally every other device in existence where the DLC could be downloaded separately."
69689,"Yeah, it is a weird situation admittedly born mostly from my desire to own a physical copy of my games and impatience when the game came out, but this is the first time I have ever seen DLC linked directly to the game like this. Even on the 3DS you could choose to download or uninstall the game and the DLC separately."
112261,My physical copy is updated to the latest version. Still nothing.
