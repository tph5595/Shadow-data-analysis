63839,Want to get around quick but your stamina isn't that high? You can recharge stamina while moving at a speed that's faster than walking by holding down the down arrow (the whistle) while tapping B. It's super useful for early in the game when stamina is low and you are in an area it's inconvenient to ride in.
