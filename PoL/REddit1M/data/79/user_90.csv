The entire concept of the storyline is that the same events keep recurring through history, as if Gannon, Link, and Zelda are kind of reincarnated continually and form this triangle balance of power, with Link and Zelda standing in opposition of Gannon's power.

I also really like the brutality of Hard Mode. My suggestion to you, having played normal too, is to focus more on exploring and collecting for awhile before regularly engaging enemies. And when you do, be selective. Weigh the cost against the benefit. You're pretty low on the food chain in Hard Mode. I had to force myself to run away for awhile, as it wasn't my natural reaction. I tend to lean toward fight, not flight. In Hard Mode, you need to learn that discretion is the better part of valor. "
