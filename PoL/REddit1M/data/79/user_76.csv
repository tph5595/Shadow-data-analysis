346978,"I've been trying for hours to get the Lord of the Mountain to spawn and it just won't

I've tried keeping an eye on Satori Mountain for the glow during normal gameplay

I've tried waiting until 10pm for ~90 ingame days (away from the mountain, usually on Central Tower)

I've tried checking during full moons

I've tried keeping the game running in one place for hours while I check the screen every few minutes with the mountain in view

Someone please help me"

I wish the spawn requirements were a bit clearer "

Do you always see the glow first when you go up there?"
