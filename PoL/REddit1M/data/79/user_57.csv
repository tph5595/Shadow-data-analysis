204345,"You could probably ask me any question about the game, and I would be able to answer it. But, the one category that I'm weak on is damage numbers. Drunken_Idiot on GameFAQ's might be a better person to contact. [He has a big thread here on damage calculations](https://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/189707-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/75149333).

Since you're curious, though, I did a quick test. I grabbed a Falcon Bow, which has 20 attack power. I then tested against a normal Blue Bokoblin and a Bokoblin sentry.

Normal Blue Bokoblin

- Normal Hit: 52/72 HP  
- Headshot: 32/72 HP

Sentry Blue Bokoblin

- Normal Hit: 52/72 HP
- Headshot: Killed the Blue Bokoblin

Normally, arrows do double damage upon headshots, but as it's seen here, it does way more than double damage. The mechanics behind this is prolly to reward the player for stealthily taking down the guards. (I should have used a weaker bow to figure out the exact multiplier, but I hope it's sufficient.)"
