508833,"Sorry if this is late and you're already past the talus, but the general strategy I use to beat talus goes like this:

1. Throw a bomb towards one of the arms. This may or may not destroy one, but it usually hits the ore spot and makes the talus fall down.

2. Wait for it to fall and then climb on at a leisurely pace. 

3. Smack the ore deposit to your liking and hop off whenever you feel like it is gonna try to shake you off. Usually, I just spin with a two hand weapon for few seconds. 

4. Rinse and repeat. If the talus has an ore deposit that is more exposed you can just shoot an arrow at it and the talus will fall. Also, you can drop a bomb and spin the talus around so that its back is exposed to the bomb. 

Hope this helps "
