312277,"Is it already well-known that you can slow-mo arrow a Lynel in the back of the head several times while you're in the air from getting bucked off it? I never see this in Lynel videos, but I've been doing it constantly since I accidentally discovered it. With a x5 Savage bow and elemental arrows, you can actually kill a silver Lynel with face shots on the sail-in approach, ride once, and then use the buck-time to finish it off with arrows in the back of the head. Just be ready to use the arrow button shortly after your fifth blow while riding it, and aim for about the middle of the back of its head."
