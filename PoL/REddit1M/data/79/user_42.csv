128733,"&gt; Is there a way to increase weapon durability?

Not as such. But eating food or wearing armor that buffs your attack power will make weapons more efficient by delivering more damage per strike.

Different weapons have different durability levels, and some depend on what you strike. For instance, axes take way less damage when destroying wooden objects than they do against enemies; sledgehammers take less damage than anything else for mining ore deposits; Ancient and Guardian weapons take less damage against Guardian enemies; etc.

Every one of the four main dungeons awards you with a special weapon unique to that city's race; they are all higher damage and higher durability than common weapons, and when they break, you can replace them by paying a single diamond and some amount of common material.

There are some convenient places where weapons are just lying around, and they respawn every Blood Moon. One tower has a high-damage claymore on top of it.

Sneaking into Hyrule Castle is a great way to score some good loot; there's an armory in there if you can find it, as well as another place with the best shield in the game. (That shield is twenty times more durable than the next-strongest shield, and it's replaceable when it breaks if you finish the right sidequest and find the right person to ask.) You should not afraid of going to the castle for this purpose earlyish in the game, or ever, since there's no real penalty for dying and you can warp out at any time.

And of course, the sword that's in every Zelda game is in this one too, and once you get it, whenever it ""breaks"" it becomes usable again ten minutes later.

&gt; Should I stop bitching and just play the game in Normal mode? Is Normal mode too easy?

I would start in normal mode. Master Mode seems way harder than any previous Hero Mode. Normal difficulty gets easy after a while, and everyone who puts off the final battle until they make their Link a powerhouse is disappointed by how easy *it* is. But normal mode is no cakewalk for at least the first 10 or 20 hours, and certain enemies and other things remain difficult way later, too.

**TL;DR**: Most people find normal mode hard at first. Start there, and if it gets too easy too soon, then consider resuming your Master Mode file
