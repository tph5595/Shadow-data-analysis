If Voe leave when they're of age, instead of mating with a Vai, how do the Vai in Gerudo Town reproduce PureGerudo Voe every hundred years? That one Voe born would have to stick around, ya know? "

257409,"Ganon isn't too tough. 13 hearts and the master sword should suffice as far as that goes, with some defense buffs.

However, level 8 armor doesn't make sense. The max I believe is 4, one level per fairy. Or maybe 3... I honestly am drawing a blank, but anyways. Level 8 isn't possible, do you mean the defense of your armor is 8?

If you have your Hylian armor set to 3 stars, that should be good enough. You don't need anything too outstanding if you're good at parrying/dodging."
257442,Do you use motion controls to aim or aim manually with the joystick?
257750,"Which doesn't make sense because as far as I'm concerned, glowing objects don't make someone MORE sneaky. "
257766,"In the game yes, but in reality no lol."
257924,"Can guarantee not Wind Waker considering they just made the remake for the previous console. Although OoT and MM have been out for awhile now as remakes. I'm sure there wouldn't be much opposition to a console remake, however the opposition might come when they try to charge $60 for it. I mean how many times can you expect people to pay for the same game again and again. "
262841,"Ah okay, if you're 2* and 8 def then it must be 4* and I believe at 4* all the Hylian armor hits 20 defense each. Which is more than enough for Ganon if you're skilled at fighting and dodging/parrying and are well equipped. If you want to practice for Ganon, just get comfortable with most enemies' melee attacks and Guardian's lasers and you'll be set for Ganon."
269995,"Well yeah... we were talking about individual re-re-releases of the 3 mentioned games. What you said very likely won't happen. 
I seem to like the fact that the variety of Zelda games are scattered across the consoles. It feels special when I see people post pictures of their classic cartridges and how they found them after x amount of years. To have all 20 games on one disc/cartridge would almost just feel boring to me. 

**Of course I'd want to buy it though.**"
