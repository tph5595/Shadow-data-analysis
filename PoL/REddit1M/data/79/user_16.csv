45454,"So I stopped playing for about 3 months before the dlc, to let a friend borrow the system. I'm finishing up side quests between working on trials. I have read every help thread and watched every YouTube video, but that damn ice dragon Naydra will not spawn. I've cleansed the malice (I have all 120 shrines clear so I did at one point get a scale.) I'm not too close to the mountain (camping down by the Lanaryu east gate as seems most commonly recommended),I try resting until morning or night, waiting several in game hours, but nothing. I've exited and restarted the game. I've powered the Wii u off and back on. I've tried warping to the spring of wisdom, camping until night, and gliding down the mountain as was recommended elsewhere. This dragon is harder than the trials! Not really, but it's way more frustrating. I've wasted probably 2 real world hours trying to hunt this dragon for armor upgrades. Does anybody have a fool proof or nearly anyway method to get her(?) to spawn? "
47187,"Thanks; I'll give it a try (tomorrow night at this point, sadly work calls me back tomorrow...)"
96641,"Hm, a lot longer if I don't need to farm the other two, but if it works, I will take it, because I have tried everything else! (Except the other suggestion here, that's still pending.) :D"
119056,"not yet, but I don't think I need as many if I'm not getting the amiibo armor sets."
121856,"A 30 minute defense buff can help a lot. 4 defense items plus a dragon horn (cook and eat before starting the trial). Past that, I recommend trying to blow up at least one hand with bombs before climbing, then unleash with your strongest weapons once you get to the top. Shouldn't be any reason you take lethal damage... You might get shaken off, if that happens run away and blow up a hand before trying again."
122390,"So this worked once. From a balcony on the SE shore of the promenade (not the bay, that confused me for a sec, the bluff isn't by the bay) I camped until morning and a few minutes later there came the dragon. Shot a horn, returned to my camp, rested to morning, wait... No dragon. Tried again, no dragon (and it's raining and there's no shelter here, must find new camp)."
210373,"I can't get the dragon to appear consistently at all. I normally do return to my fire and camp again and wait for the dragon to come by again, but it never shows up twice. Did not have this problem with farosh. Haven't really farmed dinraal that much yet, but I know I got a bunch of horns from it so I just have to go back if I need claws or scales or fangs later "
