89694,"2 questions:

1. If I select ""Play in Master Mode"" from the title screen and create a new game, will it overwrite my normal mode progress?  My gut says no and that they will be 2 seperate profiles, but I don't want to take any chances. 

2. If I lend my Wii U to a friend how does he create a new profile for him to play though? I'm thinking he would need to create a new Mii character, but would he be able to play the DLC that I have purchased and he be able to use amiibos without making an online account? That would be the ideal solution at least, if not what would be the best way for him to play the DLC with the amiibos? "
