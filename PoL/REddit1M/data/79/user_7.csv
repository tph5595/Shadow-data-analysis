With my Switch, I just farmed Naydra yesterday from Lanaru Bay, from near the center of the bay on the southeast shore at Lanaru's Buff facing the promenade. There are some small balconies where I set up a fire set to morning and it would take no more than 3 minutes to appear from the east traveling down the length of Lanaru Bay. Kind of a pain to find the shards and scales from there since it's daylight and enemies in the water, but it worked every single time for me. Sorry you might have some weird glitch, good luck."

Then selected ""Sit by the fire until - Morning"" and when the game started back up, less than 60 seconds later I could see Naydra. If no flameblade then drop a flint on the wood and hit that with a metal blade. 

Repeat that as often as you like, the scales or whatever you knock down will stay where it landed no matter how many time you fast forward.

Have you given the campfire fast-forward a try instead of actually waiting?

Currently Dragon farming at the Floria bridge near Lakeside for $$$ to open up 4th Fairy. Is pretty easy"
