94150,"Here is what I do when farming items to upgrade my armor, it works every time:

I start by building a fire and sleeping until night in the Lake Tower. Then, between 12:00-12:15am Farosh arrives by Hyrule Bridge. Grab whatever item you need from Farosh then warp to Hebra Tower. Glide towards the forgotten temple, but stay on the mountain and Dinraal will appear. Once you get the item from Dinraal, warp to the Jitan Sa'mi Shrine. Glide towards Wintre Island. You should see Naydra and you can capture whichever item you need."

Let me know if that works! I only listed all of the farming as I needed several items to upgrade gear. I hate how long it takes to get Star Fragments, any insight on that?"
