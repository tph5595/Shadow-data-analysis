168216,"So headshots do twice the damage of a body shot with a bow. Sometimes, they seem to do much more, especially when the enemy is a sentry or up on a platform: this happens regardless of whether or not they are aware of me or actively engaged in shooting at me. Does anyone have an explanation for this, or can direct me toward a thorough breakdown of the game's damage mechanics?"
