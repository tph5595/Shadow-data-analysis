Rain makes it darn near impossible to climb, and cold and warm weather require gear or potions to avoid health effects. Beyond that there isn't much. There is no requirement to sleep, you simply do so to alter time and regen health. Eating is also not required other than to regen health. Climbing, swimming, and gliding require stamina that you can upgrade."
