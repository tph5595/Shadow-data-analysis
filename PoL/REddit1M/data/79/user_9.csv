* Forest Dweller's Sword
* Kite Shield
* Lynel Crusher
* Lynel Spear
* Mighty Lynel Crusher
* Mighty Lynel Spear


Forest Dweller's Sword is missable after you've exhausted all its treasure chests and completed the Wood Trial once. Subsequent runthroughs of the Wood Trial will not let you keep it, you can only borrow it for the minigame.


Kite Shield is missable after you've exhausted all its treasure chests and obtained Selmie's only Kite Shield.


Once all Red-Maned Lynels have upgraded, you can no longer obtain the Lynel Crusher or Lynel Spear. Since the Ploymus Mountain Lynel remains red, you can still obtain the Lynel Sword, Lynel Bow, and Lynel Shield.


Once all Blue-Maned Lynels have upgraded, you can no longer obtain the Mighty Lynel Crusher or Mighty Lynel Spear. A Blue-Maned Lynel remains in Hyrule Castle's First Gatehouse. This Lynel is glitched in that it won't drop its weapons unless you save and reload inside the gatehouse. It drops a Mighty Lynel Sword, Mighty Lynel Bow, and Mighty Lynel Shield.
