126914,"I purchased BoTW a few days ago along with the expansion pass. I started with Master Mode right off the bat with zero knowledge of the game (I play most of my games at the hardest or next-to-hardest setting and I hate using guides). The game is brutal. My weapons keep breaking, causing me to run away from enemies 95% of the time. The one time I find a nice claymore or mace/hammer, I can only take out 2-3 dudes before that breaks, too. I'm trying to enjoy the difficulty, but with every weapon being so brittle, im running and hiding more than I'm fighting...and it's somewhat negatively affecting my enjoyment of the game. 

Is there a way to increase weapon durability? Is there a point in the game where I don't have to worry about weapon durability anymore (and is it early-ish in the game?) Should I stop bitching and just play the game in Normal mode? Is Normal mode too easy? Are weapons in BoTW made of paper mache?"
