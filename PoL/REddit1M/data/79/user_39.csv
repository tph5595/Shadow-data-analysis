117410,"Got a switch recently and have been playing botw for about a week. I have been taking my time and have only explored about 5 regions. The main armor I use is the climbing gear, the only other armor I have is the zora and the shirt impa gives you. I have not upgraded any of it at the fairy fountain, because I don't know if I will find objectively better armor like I am weapons. Am I gimping myself by not upgrading anything or should I save my materials until I find something better?"
