113768,"How to beat Stone Talus in the trials? I keep trying to climb him but I get 1 shot with 13+ hearts. How do I avoid getting 1HKO? I don't even know what move he does that is killing me, it doesn't even look like there is an attack animation, I just die while climbing him"
152298,"Any tips on Master mode Begginer Trial level 10? It's the one with 3 lizalfos.. the problem I'm having is I kill the blue one, and the other 2 just wreck me.

I can fight them pretty easy, but the issue is when they get knocked into the water with my melee they just regen a bunch of health while I can't do any effective damage to them in the water. Then eventually all my weapons break and neither of them are dead"
