62160,"Other than collection purposes and the right to say you completed it, is there really any reason to do the DLC after you've already beat Ganon?

I don't really have any intention of fighting him again, and since I'm only at 20% completion, I have no desire to start over after I get 100%.

I understand the reward for the Trial of the Sword, but it doesn't really do much for you after beating Ganon.

I guess it makes the 100% completion a bit easier, but still."
