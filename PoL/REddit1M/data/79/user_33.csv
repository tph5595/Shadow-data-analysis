111200,"Yes, any attack will effect the durability of a weapon with the exception of mounting a Lynel."
129059,"There is no way to increase weapon durability. The only exception is the Master Sword. 

You'll always have to worry about weapon durability. If weapons had infinite durability, it would break the game. The whole point of this game is to explore, experiment, and scavenge the entire world. 

If you're not enjoying Master Mode, then you should go to Normal Mode. The game was already difficult in the beginning. Master Mode just makes it brutal with enemies having more HP and regenerative health."

286229,That shouldn't be possible unless they hacked the game or converted their hearts to stamina upgrades.
372246,"No, you'll have to buy the expansion pass again for the Switch."
384385,There is one Shrine in the Gerudo region that will require completing Vah Naboris.
559969,Yep. 
564827,"If you aren't upgrading armor that was unlocked by amiibos (WW Tunic, TP Tunic, etc.), then you only need 3 fragments for the Ancient Set. If you do, well you'll need a lot.

edit: I think you may need some for the Tunic of the Wild."
