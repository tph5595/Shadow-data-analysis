16960,"Edit: God shit, people. Clearly was not aware that the whole ""Delete after 24 hours"" thing wasn't real. I just remember seeing it on Rom sites a decade ago. Thanks all for the heads up!


I think it's okay to have roms of games that you actually own. Otherwise you have to ""delete them within 24 hours"".

I mean, not that Nintendo is sending out goon squads to punish people for having a rom of A Link To The Past or anything."
