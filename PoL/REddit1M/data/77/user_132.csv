It was still fun, but can not compare to games like Majora's Mask, Wind Waker, actually any of the console games. It might have been an improvement on one of the DS games but compared to Seasons/Ages, Minish Cap, Link's Awakening? No, ALBW is not the best Zelda game at all."
66653,"if i may just roll my opinion train into the station for a second, WOW you think that a game which is basically a remake to ALTTP is better than Wind Waker? Alright I'm done."

196461,"The reason I am criticizing ALBW on it's strong similarities to ALTTP is because Nintendo has been harshly abusing that for too long now, and for some reason (probably nostalgia), a lot of the fans are supporting this. We have had a OoT remake and now a sort of ALTTP remake and the fans on this subreddit keep praying for a Majora's Mask remake. What's the point? 

We have the virtual console. There isn't enough originality going around Nintendo right now. They are making more sequels and remakes than ever, and there is a noticeable drop in quality."
