I still have the DS phat, but I lost the charging cable quite a while ago. So at the moment, no way to play an awesome game I never actually beat.

I keep holding out that they'll put GBA titles on the eshop eventually, but when I clear through the backlog of games I need to play first, I may buy a second hand cable just to play this game."
