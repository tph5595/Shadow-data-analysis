27488,"The ""delete them within 24 hours"" was just a way of piracy sites to ""look"" legal back when people didn't know copyright law. It was illegal back then and it's illegal now.

The only legal way of emulation is to back up the games yourself. And then emulating them is still illegal.

This is in the US BTW. You are allowed one backup copy for storage purposes or if the original gets damaged. If you sell/give away the original copy you must delete the backup."
27695,"PH you can just buy. The ambassador thing you have to snag a console that has it and then do a system transfer (or just use the ambassador console). For four swords your only hope is to find a console that still has it downloaded. Because if it was deleted you can't get it back.

I helped someone with this a while back. I feel like ambassador consoles w/ four swords are going to shoot up in price."
27828,Asking about LCT is like asking about Ancient Stone Tablets or the Tingle Series.
34380,Ancient Stone Tablets can't be played any more. Unless you illegally play it on an emulator.
43162,"Technically they can. Making unauthorized backups and then using those backups is illegal.

Not that they'd really do anything. It's usually just better (for Nintendo) to go after distributors. That is, either bootleg makers or people distributing the files.

Either way, unless you get the copy of the game from Nintendo, it's unauthorized and illegal.

The relevant section:

&gt;Under section 117, you or someone you authorize may make a copy of an original computer program if:

&gt;&gt;the new copy is being made for archival (i.e., backup) purposes only;

&gt;&gt;you are the legal owner of the copy; and

&gt;&gt;any copy made for archival purposes is either destroyed, or transferred with the original copy, once the original copy is sold, given away, or otherwise transferred.

Basically, you can only make a backup for archival purposes. So if the cartridge goes to shit you can run the backup. Otherwise you can't touch it.

With the introduction of the DMCA (which we all know and hate), the laws were shifted a bit and now developers themselves can mark how they want their software to work. Most game developers restrict backups or running backups. But you'd have to check the TOS and EULA of those particular companies.

Basically, making a backup unless it's for archival purposes is illegal. There are some companies that explicitly allow it, but other than that, nope."
