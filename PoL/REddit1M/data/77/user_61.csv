The fact that other people can enjoy the game does NOT take anything away from anyone.

That would be selfish of them to think that way, and if they do I don't care much for what they feel then."

Well, with that said, it's known that Nintendo doesn't want to release GBA games to the eShop because they ""break"" the experience. I seem to remember that it's not emulation but uses the hardware directly instead, making it impossible to leave the game using the Home Button for example (kind of link what happened when you played NGC games on Wii).

I seem to remember that Nintendo stated that those games wouldn't be released until they found a better way to play them on 3DS."
