49609,TECHNICALLY....but if you werent an ambassador or didnt have a 3ds for the 25th anniversary then theres no way to get them all today since nintendo wont release those games to be paid for
49999,"nope - its for early adopters of the 3ds - i missed it by a couple months but luckily i still got four swords adventures. people who got the 3ds before the price drop got a handful of GBA and other games like zelda and mario kart for supporting the system when it didnt have much.....but now nintendo is being dumb and wont release these games to the store....i would pay $10 for some of those games! (mainly just minish cap)
"
50255,its not even a joke
50291,nice work - im on my way to completing all of the games...im at 9/14 completed...soon to be 11/14
50523,it wouldnt be worthless....they still got MULTIPLE games for FREE....and have had that for a couple years now. thats enough for being early adopters and nintendo needs to allow other people to BUY these now
50599,right? and ambassadors prolly dont play these games much anymore anyways so they REALLY wouldnt care
50659,well amazon.com will fix the PH problem.....the other two - sorry -=/
50699,its on the 3ds eshop
50786,havent beaten minish cap yet so i wont judge. but PH was VERY inventive and i had a lot of fun with playing a new style of my favorite game series. I enjoyed it and am excited to play spirit tracks once i finish a link between worlds
50904,"not GCN games - but if you have TP on wii, and you have WWHD instead of WW...then you just need to have games like OoT elsewhere....i cant think....prolly

*EDIT: you wont be able to play four swords adventures without GCN"
51215,but the WiiU cant play GCN games
51430,didnt know that...but i mean if they still use save states instead of picking up exactly where you left off (like you can do in the GBC games or like super mario bros.) it would still work.....save after each grand prix in mario kart and save at certain points in minish cap ?
80542,no im saying like you can find a save in game when playing on the 3ds - that type of thing ...save state was prolly the wrong word...
80777,"thats messed up. you dont think 20 games for free is enough? what, 2 years of exclusivity? its not hurting you any if people are finally able to play a zelda game that you can only find used, for people to play games that are 10 yrs old on a newer and better console.

do you brag to your friends that dont have these games and just hold it over them? whats the point of you having them but not letting people BUY them? would you be mad if i played minish cap on my GBA?...cause i have it....i can do it. i just want it digitally on my better console with  a bigger and brighter screen"
81623,yeah i have all the other zeldas (except for adventures of link for a few reasons) and im not going to emulate when i can play the real thing. i just would like it digitally and on a better more used console like i said. and nintendo is dumb for not putting a $5-$10 tag on 2 year old ambassador games
