Watching that again recently made me realize why my mom didn't really like me watching it as a kid. It's basically the worst kind of pointless children's programming. The anti-Mister Rogers."

My issue was less with the storytelling (which I thought was mostly pretty good) but more with the lack of change in the environment as the game progresses. The people in Hyrule Castle town say the same stuff for the entirety of the game, for example. Playing Okami at around the same time, where towns and scripts change constantly really hammered home how weirdly static Twilight Princess feels."
