92131,"Wait, can't you go into the wii mode on the WiiU and buy it through the Wii store? And then play it with a classic controller? 

I ask because I'm actually really interested in buying a WiiU, mostly for the purpose of playing Zelda games I can't get on my 3DS. But I'm still a bit confused about the different eshops and how it works and which games I can use the pro controller for, etc. "

would you happen to know if I can use a wii U pro controller instead of the Wii classic controller to play games like that on the wii's shop though? not really zelda related but this is a good opportunity to ask."
