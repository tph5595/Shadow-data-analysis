73408,"I liked it, but I expected so much more. Loved the more ""realistic"" look, loved the size of Hyrule, the items, the dungeons, but I think it was much more linear than I would've liked. Hyrule Field is *huge*, but contains so little. A bug here and there, a couple pieces of heart, maybe some rupees underwater...and that was pretty much it. In previous Zelda games finding secrets was half the fun. There just wasn't enough content outside the main storyline IMO.

Just take a look at the main town. You can barely interact with anything there. OoT had much more diverse and interesting towns, even when not considering the release time difference."
