21836,*WiiU - Winder Waker HD.
28160,"Then why are there multiply listing for Ocarina of Time, Legend of Zelda and Adventure of Link? They're already represented on the Wii as well."
29669,"I'm not exactly seeing a persuasive argument for not listing the WiiU/Wind Waker HD. I mean, if you're gonna relist Ocarina of Time on the 3DS, why not WWHD?"
33505,"Does the WiiU not have access to the same virtual library as the Wii? If it does, then that makes his lists incomplete/incorrect."
34382,"See, that there makes a difference. That is the kind of information I was looking for.

That being said, his title is still technically... misleading, I suppose, by not including Wind Waker HD. "
65608,"Ocarina of Time 3DS is a remake, so why does it count then?"
