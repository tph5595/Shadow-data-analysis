For me, it currently goes:

1) Majora's Mask
2) A Link to the Past
3) A Link Between Worlds
4) Wind Waker

Wind Waker used to be no. three, but ALBW knocked it down a peg."
32929,"I wouldn't say it's the best in the series (Majora's Mask still holds that title, for me), but the arguments you gave about the magic of an old game hold true. I was pleasantly surprised when I played it and enjoyed it so thoroughly. Handheld Zelda has been generally good Zelda (except for Hourglass and Spirit Tracks)."
47756,"The controls were the worst thing about them. They sucked in other areas too, but the controls sealed the coffin."
82825,"It was a hard choice to make and one that was greatly influenced by nostalgia and personal love. I loved ALBW because I *really* loved ALttP.

Is there anything wrong with that?"
83039,"Well, the controls...you *had* to use the touch screen to move, fight, use items, etc.

The dungeons, in my opinion, weren't very challenging. PH was bearable, but, to me, ST was godawful, for all then reason that PH wasn't good and more. The idea of a race of people called the Locomo and ancient train tracks just irked me. I'm not against technological progression in a fantasy world like Hyrule, but it must make historical sense and not be an ancient treasure from a bygone race of train people.

Did I mention the controls?"
83134,"&gt;For me, it currently goes:

Yes, it is my opinion. I didn't think I needed to say ""these are my opinions"" because the fact I was saying it meant it was my opinion and I did say that the lineup, *for me*, was the games that I listed."
135809,"I haven't forsaken my love for The Wind Waker. I still believe it to be one of the most underrated Zelda games, but ALBW has stolen my heart. This in no way lessens or cheapens WW.

Why don't you like ALBW?"
193385,"I think that was kind of the point. It was a direct sequel. It was something we don't see a lot of in the series, a game set in exactly the same version of Hyrule and map setup as it's prequel. It was something different for a Zelda game. And for me, and I think a lot of other fans, that was the drawing factor. I knew the map well, but there were differences.

I agree that it was a bit on the easy side, but at least Hero mode is a little more of a challenge.

And, if you ask me, the remixed classic soundtrack was fucking awesome. Zelda music has always been a huge interest of mine. I backed the Twilight Symphony project, have collected tons of remixes, etc. And getting to hear classic ALttP tunes remixed and with better production values was like a nostalgic shot of heroin.

I'll admit that the game relies more on it's classic ties than it does standing on it's own merit, but I think that kind of *gives* it its own merit. Obviously, they shouldn't make a habit of revisiting previous Zelda maps, but it worked here and made for a very unique Zelda experience. I wouldn't mind seeing another of it's kind with maybe a revisit to Termina or even Koholint island, though those maps could do with some more redesigning

I just don't see how critisizing the game for being too reliant on it's predecessor is a valid complaint. That's the point. It would be like criticizing Grand Theft Auto for being too reliant on the driving mechanic."
198754,"I don't, and I didn't think other fans did, count remakes as real releases. I'd love a Majora's Mask remake for the 3DS so that I can play it while watching TV. Nobody is saying that we should have only remakes and sacrifice official releases.

ALBW isn't a remake. It is a lot like ALttP, but it is the first and only Zelda game of it's kind. I mean, everyone is welcome to dislike it, though I personally don't think one sequel bearing such similarities to it's predecessor is a bad thing, that is simply an opinion from one guy.

But I don't think it's a crime to enjoy remakes of OoT or potentially MM as they aren't main releases. I don't think many people became upset when ALttP was ported to the GBA. It just gives you another medium in which to play the game while not detracting from any of the main titles. I, personally, would love to have  Wii U so I could replay the Wind Waker in HD.

If we had three or four or five direct sequels like ALBW then I would share your sentiments, but, as it stands, I don't think this is a terrible thing.

Yes, Twilight Princess was too much of an OoT wannabe that it didn't really bring anything spectacular to the table, but a lot of people loved it. I didn't care much at all for it, but that's just me. I would have preferred a direct sequel to OoT than a game that was dressing itself up as OoT but not really pulling it off.

A lot of this argument, I think on both sides, is our personal preference, so I don't think we won't reach a mutual agreement. I do see where you are coming from, but I don't think the franchise is in such a trend of repetition, as you suggest, just yet."
199264,"I agree. ALBW was a wonderful appetizer for me. Not quite so small as a snack, but not a full meal.

I still have Skyward Sword to play, as I never got around to getting far into it. I guess I had trouble getting into it. Now that I have a much bigger television I might give it another go.

I just hate having to always buy a new Nintendo console *just* so it'll be a Zelda-Machine. I mean, I usually always get the new MarioKart and such, but I probably wouldn't purchase a console just for some of those other games."
227830,"Just a side note, I meant bearable, not beatable.

I still haven't beat the last dungeon on ST to this day."
