25755,"YES! amen to that friend. Capcom really knows how to make great zelda games. I hope someday they make another one. They dont take as many risks as nintendo in terms of being innovative. Which is something I like with zelda. I want that old school zelda feel, same style I love and know, only better and more polished. More sidequests, more creative puzzles that I wont fly through effortlessly. 

link between worlds was a great game and im very happy with it. Hard mode is definitely a challenge, but at the end of the day, to me the puzzles were just too simple. I flew through every dungeon without really ever having to stop and think. I knew the answer to every puzzle right away. 

So glad I got the ambassador program when I bought my 3ds :) "

54862,"The thief cave places?? I did many of them but never found them challenging. 

Funny story but it wasn't until hard mode that I discovered there were Pegasus boots in the game. I even had done that one thiefs cave that ""requires"" you to run really fast through timed gates just by using bombs wisely. It was pretty fun and was actually pretty challenging to do it with bombs. Everyone try it out if you're bored! "
