It might be because it was my first Zelda experience, but that game is amazing - the story, the gameplay. It blew anything I'd played on the gameboy out of the water. It's a classic Zelda game, where the Minish Cap felt a bit like a novelty. Still good, but not really what I want from a Zelda game."
