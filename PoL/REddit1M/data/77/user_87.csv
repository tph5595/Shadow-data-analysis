Except the boomerang. I'll admit, that thing was kinda neato."
60495,"I played Rosy Ruby Land, or whatever it was called. It wasn't amazing, but certainly fun and had a distinct atmosphere and charm. Kinda silly and also a bit bleak, but in a wacky way, rather than a creepy one. It's really hard to describe how I felt about that game. I guess calling the game tingle-y might be an accurate description."

No, this is not really a good justification to pass on LBW.

Seriously, at least give that one a shot. It's really damn good. A bit easy, a bit short, but pretty much perfect as long as it lasts. It's pretty much the closest thing to classic Zelda since a long time, while never feeling really dated. At least rent it, or something. "
