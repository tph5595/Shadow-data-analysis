66979,"Link Between Worlds is completely different from Phantom Hourglass and Spirit tracks. They've done away with the touchscreen controls. It's kind of like Link to the Past but with upgraded graphics and music (I am so in love with the music in this game). I blasted through it in a week, and I don't have the best attention span for games."

73823,"You're talking about the Temple, right? It's a bit annoying, but I found it's more interesting if I consider part of the challenge deciding what notes to leave myself. Coming up with the right annotations for the map is another puzzle to solve. The each run through the temple is a new speed run to see if I can beat my previous time. It adds a now challenge, instead of just tedium. But that's just me, ymmv. (I'm a little over halfway through the game, btw) I suppose it helps that I just got Oot 3D at the same time, so if I get tired of one, I just switch to the other. Keeps things a bit fresh."
