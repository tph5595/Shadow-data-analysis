24729,"&gt;strong backing evidence

Can you give an example of some actual 'strong' evidence?  All I've ever seen is extreme stretches pertaining to symbolism (which, in itself, is incredibly vague) and things that have proven simply to be false.

&gt;I do follow the theory that MM is some sort of dream rather than an actual occurrence.

Hyrule Historia says it's a real land.

&gt; Many of the characters in MM were alternate versions of OoT characters, which could be explained by it all being a dream

Could also be explained by the fact that *every Zelda ever* does this, or by the fact that it's an alternate world...

There is literally no reason to believe it was a dream other than extreme stretches which are so vague and blurry that they could *anything* or *nothing.*  Zero 'theoretical' value."
24830,"He's got the same level of critical thinking of a child who really wants something.  You know the ridiculous arguments kids come up with to try and get that toy they really want, or some candy?  That's exactly how he operates."
24897,It's because they don't.  You can draw any connection to anything if you try hard enough.  Look at conspiracy theorists. 
25007,"A pissed off Deku isn't really strong enough to support ""Everything is the 5 stages of grief!""

Even if they *were* symbolic to stages of grief... how does the rest of the theory come from that?"
25579,"While I think that theory is silly as hell, and nonsensical, your way of looking at it is the best way.  Even Nintendo described their games in a similar way."
27492,"If the areas really do represent the 5 stages, why does it mean anything more than that?  If anything, it's just like a 'theme' to each area. I don't see how it has any deeper meaning, such as Link being dead, or Termina being a dream world."
36528,"&gt;But that doesn't mean the different stages are not the main theme of the game

And how does that back up the fact that he's dead?  The world is ending, of course people are going to grieve.  Even if they are a theme to the places, how does that support anything else in the theory?

&gt;Link, wandering through the lost woods, accidentally enters some sort of weird alternate world including many exact clones of people from OoT,

You've never heard of a parallel dimension, before?  Do you not watch movies or read books?  It's a pretty common device.  

&gt; and a few select people who have actually come from Hyrule who also apparently took a walk in the Lost Woods and somehow managed to make the same mistake before Link got there? How does that make any sense?

The Happy Mask salesman was on his quest for Majora's Mask, when he went to Termina.  It's not farfetched that he learned of this 'portal' somehow, nor is it that Skull Kid might find it, seeing as *lives in the fucking Lost Woods.* Or maybe he followed the Happy Mask Salesman to get the mask?

Link's getting there was merely by chasing Skull Kid back the where was currently hanging out, and causing trouble.

&gt;why is the landscape completely different?

Because it would be absurdly boring to have the exact same world in two back to back games.

&gt;Also, why are some people cloned but others aren't?

Just because you don't see them doesn't mean they're not in the world, and the same goes for Hyrule's alternates of new Termina people.  You don't meet *everyone* in the damn world in either OoT or MM.

&gt;Also, when the moon is destroyed, how does that not doom Termina

Why would it?  In reality, losing your moon would cause some hardcore tsunamis yeah... but it wouldn't 'doom' an entire world, and this is a fantasy game where real-world physics consequences aren't generally touched upon.

&gt;and how does that not affect Hyrule?

Because it's an entirely different world?  It's not two sides of the same planet, lol.  Again, I ask, are you unfamiliar with parallel worlds?  Hell, it's even something considered and theorized by physicists.

&gt;In the case of MM, they characters are literally the same. Yet some of them are apparently exact clones who have never been to Hyrule while others seem to be literally the same people who Link met in OoT (examples include Happy Mask Salesman, Skull Kid, and Epona)

They *are* the same people... and Epona is a horse. Are you not actually familiar with the story?

&gt;It just doesn't make sense that Termina is a real place that you can physically visit

Time travel and splitting timelines doesn't make sense either, but things like that, and parallel worlds, are common device in fantasy stories.

&gt;Where is it physically located

Where all parallel worlds are?  Another dimension?

&gt;How do you get there and back?

Through some kind of portal?  Again, this is pretty basic fantasy material...

&gt;I think that right there is pretty definitive evidence that Termina is not a real place.

Asking ""how"" about a few things is not ""definitive evidence"".  Nor is pointing out a couple things that could honestly be explained in a million different ways.  Nor is people being similar... in a parallel world.

And finally:

&gt;The official version is just the theory that the Zelda merchandise team or whoever wrote the book

That would be Miyamoto and Aonuma... the creator and co-creator of the series, and its story.  If I write a book, you can't tell me that I'm ""wrong"" about how I decide the story should go, regardless of what your opinion is on what would make a better story.

Now that we're done discussing ""what ifs"" and ""whys"", let me present you with a few facts that simply prove it wrong.

1.  The theory states that Link died and turned into a Stalfos, which you see in TP.  Except kids who die don't turn into Stalfos, they turn into Skull Kids, and the Hero's Shade doesn't actually look like a Stalfos.  He's a ghost, while Stalfos are just skeletons.  Their only real similarity is that they both look like dead things. This means Link had to grow up and die to become that Hero's Shade, in any case.  Unless he died as a 12 year old and somehow became the image of an ancient, full grown being.

2. The theory states that Link gets lost because he had no fairy... except neither did Sheik/Zelda, when she entered the Lost Woods to teach you about the Forest Temple and the Minuet of Forest, or Ganondorf when he used the temple to cover all of the Lost Woods and Kokiri Forest with evil.  So why did Link get lost and supposedly die?

3. (ignore this if you want to disregard what the *creators* of the story have to say and make up your own) - Hyrule Historia says TP Link is a blood-descendant of The Hero of Time.  How does Link have a kid if he died in the forest... as a kid?

**TL;DR**

&gt;The theory that Termina is a real, physical place that Link actually travelled to makes no sense and brings up so many problems

Except you didn't state any actual problems or holes... just that it was nonsensical to have a parallel dimension.

&gt;The theory that Termina is a dream presents no problems, makes a lot of sense, and fits into the rest of the series.

Except it goes against hard facts and things stated by the games themselves, as well as the game creators...

(fucking reddit formatting)"
43248,"&gt;the gorons I mentioned did, why didn't more people know about it?

It could be something as simple as a well-kept secret, a secret which is maybe less of a secret in Termina?  It's not hard to imagine that the people of Hyrule don't exactly know everything that's in the Lost Woods, but on Termina's side of the gate, there's immediate signs of civilization right where you land.  Seems pretty obvious that Termina's side is a little bit more informed on the situation.  Also, that Deku's son must have known the way to Hyrule as well, as you meet his 'corpse' on the way there.

&gt;The book was written by the writers of the Mangas, not the teams who made the games

If you google ""Who wrote Hyrule Historia?"", everything you find will tell you it was written by Miyamoto, Aonuma, Honda and Nagano.  It *is* the word when it comes to Zelda lore, and I think it's pretty certain that Miyamoto and Aonuma checked everything the book before giving the 'OK' on a story that is primarily theirs.

&gt;What ""hard facts stated by the games themselves""? There has been no reference to the occurrences of MM in any other Zelda game.

I was under the impression that you believe the whole Link is Dead theory, seeing as most people usually put them together, using that as an explanation of why he hallucinated Termina, which makes no sense.

However The Song of Healing is in Twilight Princess, and the Hero of Time 'teaches' it to you in one of those little howling sessions.  The Oath to Order is as well, iirc.

As for everything else, like the 'cloned' people and different landscape, I think it simply comes down to Aonuma's personal idea of a parallel world, and the fact that they were forced to re-use the same assets as OoT."
74604,"&gt;Do you have any strong backing evidence that the timeline is true?

Nintendo said it is?  It's official?"
79149,Yet it's the opposite.  It's basically bad fan-fiction.
80814,"I always try to explain to those people how opinions work.  You can not have an opinion that is opposite to a fact - it doesn't work that way.

I could say I ""believe"" that the Statue of Liberty is a hologram - that's my ""opinion"", but that doesn't make it any more true or valid.  It simply isn't.

You can't tell an author, that in *your* opinion, *his* story is wrong and should go another way.  That's the *opposite* of how canonicity works."
