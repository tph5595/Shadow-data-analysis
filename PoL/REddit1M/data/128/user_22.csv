Plus, when it makes it so that when I play MM, it feels more substantial and gives the world a more eerie atmosphere and more significant story."

But even if it did, would that be so bad? Link shouldn't have to be a perfect specimen in every game. Give him some depth."
87862,Says you. Many people have a very different opinion. You're not the only Zelda fan.
92831,"How is it to help himself if he doesn't know it's helping himself. Plus, that's what all charity is, whether you realize it or not, helping someone else is almost always helping yourself in some way. "
95341,"I'm saying Link doesn't know he's helping himself by helping others. Therefore, to him, he's being altruistic which altruism by intention should still be altruism even if he's technically helping himself."
96815,But the theory doesn't say that it's about link being happy. Link doesn't know it's a dream. He's subconsciously going through this all and it presents a much deeper and symbolic question that the other games don't address. I'm sorry some of us want something more than the same generic story about a guy saving the world without any further symbolism or social/psychological commentary.
