20283,"Hyrule Historia throws this theory completely out the window, but I don't care.  This was my theory going back as far as OOT, so I'm sticking with it... even if official Nintendo canon says otherwise.  

I'm a big believer in the ""legend"" in ""Legend of Zelda"".  The story is just the oral tradition in video game form.  Aside from sequels that are stated in-game to be single storylines (OOT-&gt;MM, LTTP-&gt;LA, LOZ-&gt;AOL, etc), I don't think there is a timeline.  Not just that Nintendo never planned for one, but never intended for there to be one.  Until very, very recently, Nintendo didn't care about a unified timeline, because they didn't feel it was important.  Miyamoto or whoever came up with a story for a game and wanted to tell it.  The big points (guy in green, princess, evil wizard/demon/whatever) are the same, but the details change.  

I like to think about a group of people sitting around a campfire, telling stories.  Someone says, ""I'm going to tell you the Legend of Zelda"", and proceeds to tell the story of the first NES game.  When he's done, someone else says, ""But that wasn't the end!  Link may have killed Ganon, but..."" and tells the story of Adventure of Link.

Someone else pipes up and says, ""That's not how I heard it.  Ganon wasn't a demon; he was a thief.  The king of thieves."" and tells the story of a A Link to the Past.

A little while later, someone who was at that campfire is sitting in a pub.  He goes to tell the story he heard, but maybe he gets some details wrong, or throws in his own embellishments.  In his version, Link is a boy from the fairy forest, and Ganon is the king of an Amazon tribe in the desert.  Oh, and there's time travel.  

And so on and so on.  People telling one story over and over, but it's a little different every time.  Sometimes there are floods, or trains, or shadow princesses, or magic paintbrushes.  The details change, but the story is the same story is always has been.  And in that way, a story becomes a legend.  "
