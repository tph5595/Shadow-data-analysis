28873,"I subscribe to a very similar theory, that says that when Link wished on the Triforce at the end of ALttP undoing all of Ganon's evil, the Triforce erased Ganon's evil from all of history, thereby creating an alternate universe (which subsequently split) where the Hero of Time defeated him and saved Hyrule."

Like, here's this eternal battle between two reincarnated demigods which consistently threatens the existence of the world, but the day is always saved by some normal kid who is only special in that he has the courage to stand up for what's right.   
  
Of course, several games say that Link is in fact special because it's his fate to defeat Ganon, or that he is chosen by the Goddesses to wield the Master Sword and the Triforce of Courage. I still like to think that anybody else could, but can't because they don't have Link's courage."
