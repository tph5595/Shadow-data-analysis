21623,"I like making my own theories. One thing I've been trying to work on is a single-stranded timeline. Obviously, with my limited knowledge (beat WW, OOT, TP, PH, ST, MC, MM, SS, ALBW, ALTTP, LOZ, but have yet to finish ZII, OA, OS, FS, LA and FSA)  this is nearly impossible, but I think it could happen.

All I have atm is SS and then somewhere along the line OOT(ganon gets locked up in the sacred realm)&gt;&gt; MM (which would follow the theory that didn't really happen. In my version of the timeline, it was all a dream link had of being a hero again, but he already had his turn in that lifetime.)&gt;&gt;TP in the distant future (think about it, zora's domain still frozen over, even ruto said the ice wasn't just gonna melt like that. And then ganon gets killed by the master sword at the end, but it's only temporary)&gt;&gt; fast forward again to the WW/PH/ST line, and that all is fine and well and makes sense, but I haven't yet given thought to placement of the other games."
