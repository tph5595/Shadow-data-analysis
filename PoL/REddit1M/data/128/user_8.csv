16185,"Without going into much detail (because that would take a ton of time and text), here's a brief overview of some of the theories I like to play around with:

Single timeline theory, FSA and ALttP Ganon being the same (explaining the significance of ALttP Ganon's trident and explaining how the Four Sword got in the Dark World in ALttP), SS not being first in the timeline, multiple Master Swords (OoT/TP/TWW/Oracles Master Sword and SS/ALttP Master Sword), Termina potentially being just a foreign land that Link teleported to, there being 12 Links (TMC, OoT/MM, TP, TWW/PH, ST, SS, FS, FSA, ALttP/LA, OoS/OoA, ALBW, LoZ/AoL), 13 Zeldas (TMC, OoT/MM, TP, TWW/PH, ST, SS, FS, FSA, ALttP, OoS/OoA, ALBW, LoZ, AoL), and 5 Ganons (OoT/TWW, TP, FSA/ALttP/Oracles, ALBW, LoZ) throughout the series, the Broken Sword being repaired by Patch in OoA as the canon explanation for what happened to that Master Sword after the events of TWW, the Hero's Shade being TMC Link, a Sheikah, or the hero of the Gorons mentioned in TP, the Wind Tribe being the pre-bird forms of the Oocca, Rauru potentially having been a human Oocca, Rauru and KG being different entities, Hylia possibly being the explanation for where the Triforce went post-TWW, and FS/FSA Vaati and/or Four Sword possibly being different entities than the ones we see in TMC.

I think that's all of the big ones/the ones that differ from Hyrule Historia. It's just fun trying to figure out just what the games allow or trying to work around a plot hole with a theory."
23165,"I thought that when I started playing the game, but I'm not so sure about it any more. Since Nintendo already confirmed that ALBW takes place after the Oracle games, and the Triforce was whole in the Oracles but split and separated in ALBW's back story (and this split continued through ALBW), that means that ALBW's back story about Ganon attacking and the Triforce being split has to be an entirely new story, not a retelling of ALttP.

So since ALttP Ganon died, ALBW Ganon can only be ALttP Ganon if he was brought back to life after the Oracles games for the events of ALBW's back story. It's possible, but we have no evidence that it happened. And since ALBW Ganon was apparently Ganon before he ever got the Triforce, and he didn't have a trident, this means his transformation into Ganon is unlike that of ALttP Ganon, which suggests they're probably different people."
