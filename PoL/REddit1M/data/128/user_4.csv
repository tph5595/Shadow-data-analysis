12224,"The only thing you should consider adding is that it makes the game not better, but worse. It undercuts all of the altruistic values and moments, and makes it all about link, link, link."
47751,"I have no trouble believing any of this because this is the same series where a whale can fly, triangles can grant wishes, a continent floats, people can merge into walls, two different trees talk, a race of people eat rocks, you can travel through time using music, there are dark worlds..."
47879,If I had gold...
48161,"Also, majora's mask is in a link between worlds. The game couldn't have been a dream because the mask physically exists in a different game we have no reason to suspect isn't real."
77240,"The way majora's mask is presented, it is all about helping other to ease their suffering. If the game is link's dream to overcome grief or whatever, then it is about link helping others not to help others, but about link helping others to help himself."
77427,"Because they way this concept is presented makes about link helping others to help himself, not helping others because that is what makes them happy."
77604,I feel like most (not all) people latch onto this theory because it is something they can use to sound intelligent.
79382,"And no matter how much you point out its flaws, people just use ""It is my opinion!"" as some sort of way to validate it and remove their responsibility of being incorrect."
86496,"Having link be a deeper character is fine, but not like this. It would undercut everything."
90128,Link's characterization is fine even if it comes at the expense of reducing the acts of kindness performed down to acts of kindness done to help others to help himself. Thank you for helping me understand.
93749,"&gt;How is it to help himself if he doesn't know it's helping himself?

What?

&gt;Plus, that's what all charity is, whether you realize it or not, helping someone else is almost always helping yourself in some way. 

 I agree. Most people don't give to make others feel good, they do it because it makes themselves feel good.

When it is about helping people out to ease their suffering so they can have ""good happiness"", it is way better than when it is about link's desire to be happy. If the latter is how the game was built, I would be cool with that. But having this theory undercuts the former, which is much stronger for this game."
98419,"Link's awakening did this better than this theory for majora's mask. You are told upfront this is most likely a dream, so there was no strong reason to help people other than it is the right thing to do.. Majora's mask is plenty powerful without this theory, and slightly more interesting without the focus on link. "
