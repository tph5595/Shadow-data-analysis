32063,"I'm not sure how or if SS might screw with this one, but here goes:

It's about the interlopers, and connects them to both Bongo Bongo, Majora's Mask/Termina, and the Sheikah. Mostly based on the floating hands and layout in the Twilight Palace, the eyes of the Fused Shadows, and the Sheikah's symbol.

So the Interlopers, led by Bongo Bongo, hide away in Termina, out of the Goddesses reach in order to work freely on usurping their power/the triforce. This results in Majora's Mask and other items being made. Some are worried by that power, and make the Fierce Deity to defeat it, along with a Lens of Truth since some begin to have suspicions about Bongo Bongo. Events happen involving Ikana that drives them back to Hyrule. At this point, Bongo Bongo sets up shop in the Shadow Temple performing all kinds of experiments and whatnot (hence the horrific torture rooms) in order to create the Fused Shadows.

The not evil ones of the tribe eventually realize what's going on, and make a new Lens of Truth to figure out what Bongo Bongo is up to. This leads to them sealing away Bongo Bongo and the light spirits banishing the other evil ones to the Twilight Realm. The good ones then become the Sheikah and devote themselves to protecting the Triforce (which eventually extends to protecting the Royal Family, particularly Zelda who is essentially the guardian of the Triforce).

I glossed over quite a bit, but it's already pretty long-winded."
