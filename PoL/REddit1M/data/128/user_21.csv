39009,This is what I follow is well. It just makes the most sense. It also explains why Ganon doesn't have a trident in the other games.
39297,"That Lorule is in the same ""area"" as Termina and Subrosia. It's just the flip side of hyrule.

From subrosia, we can clearly see that being the flip side is a thing (from the pirate ship that sticks out both ends). And Termina has a similar thing going on. The path to get to termina is falling down a large/long hole and then walking through a twisted path (that results in walking on the ceiling/walls in OoT).

And Lorule nails this in the head by presenting it as un ""upside down"" hyrule, complete with it's own flipped triforce. It also has a lot of similarities to MM/Termina (with the mask cult and all). And there are various references to MM in LBW.


My other theory (which is much more common) is that Wind Fish = Jabu Jabu = Levias. Just cause they are all sky whales."
39405,"ehhh, except for the fact that all the games are clearly connected.

OoT is the loose hinge, since it was retconned to include two and then three different endings/timelines.

Other than that, pretty much all the games are easily ordered."
86240,"&gt;or that The same bitch gets kidnapped by the same villian, and the same hero wearing the same clothes gets the same sword and defeats him?

Do you even pay attention to the stories?

1. It's not the same people.

2. Zelda getting kidnapped is almost never the focus of the game.

3. The games actually revolve around the triforce, Zelda is just a figure head, and Link is just a nameless hero.

The only reason Zelda is named as such is because of the declaration in AoL. And Link is only named such due to convention. He's actually named something completely different in each game, up to the user's imagination. Link is just an easy way to reference him.

As for wearing the same clothes? This is explained. It was worn by the hero (way back before SS, go read the comic) and so it became tradition for warriors/guards to wear it, and eventually that dissipated. Our Link wears it for either that reason, or a few other various reasons.

Same Sword? Not really. Only in a few games. It's completely gone in the adult Line after WW. The pre-split only has it for Skyward Sword (it's origin story). The downfall line only has it in LTTP and LBW. And the child line only has it in TP.

So thats 6 games out of 17 games. Not even half.

Ganon is in just a little more (8 or 9 depending on how you count). That's still less than half.

It's like you've only played OoT and possibly TP and just assume every Zelda game is like that."
