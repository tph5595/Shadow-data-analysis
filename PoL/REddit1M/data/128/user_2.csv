7594,"The grief theory makes a lot of sense and had a lot of strong backing evidence.  As for the variation that is the death theory, that one is more of a stretch.

I do follow the theory that MM is some sort of dream rather than an actual occurrence.  The circumstances under which Link discovered Termina where strange and mysterious.  Many of the characters in MM were alternate versions of OoT characters, which could be explained by it all being a dream.  Some MM characters mention Hyrule but no one in Hyrule mentions Termina, which further promotes the idea that Termina is not a real place.  And we already know that not all Zelda games are meant to be real occurrences; Links Awakening was a dream."
32035,"I specifically said that I don't think Link is dying.

I do think that the game is themed on grief.  It is obviously extremely different from the rest of the series and I think Nintendo intentionally themed it around grief, which is what gives the game its artistic qualities.  This also explains a lot of the creepiness such as the weird faces everywhere.

&gt; all the altruistic qualities that make the game so good

I think the game sucks.  It is my least favorite in the series, with the possible exception of Zelda II.  That is my opinion, I know a lot of you disagree.  However, I do acknowledge that it was built with deeper meaning than most of the others (the Grief theme), and it did have some interesting features like the time cycle and the masks that I think could have made the game awesome if they were done better."

/u/Knoxisawesome [wrote a paper on the topic that gives some nice examples](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qjTej3LTbaU0HgdO4mjiQvqUcRTUup8XauV3CelZqSQ/mobilebasic).  A lot of people say that because the game cannot be strictly sanctioned into different stages the theory is debunked.  Of course the different areas are not strict divisions.  But that doesn't mean the different stages are not the main theme of the game.  There are many characters throughout the game that are displaying various stages of grief.  It is not unreasonable to believe that the stages may have been a general rule for the different areas.  It is unreasonable to suggest that there was a strict division or that the lack of a strict division implies that there is no connection whatsoever.


&gt; Hyrule Historia says it's a real land

This is one of those cases where I think the theory is much better than the canon.  Remember, Hyrule Historia was written after the game was made in order to appease fans begging for official explanations.  The official version is just the theory that the Zelda merchandise team or whoever wrote the book decided to use, and does not have any backing evidence.  Or, if you must insist that Hyrule Historia is gospel, why couldn't ""alternate world"" mean a dream world?  Link, wandering through  the lost woods, accidentally enters some sort of weird alternate world including many exact clones of people from OoT, and a few select people who have actually come from Hyrule who also apparently took a walk in the Lost Woods and somehow managed to make the same mistake before Link got there?  How does that make any sense?  If there are clones of people, why is the landscape completely different?  Its not like the Dark World from ALttP where the alternate universe has a similar landscape.  Also, why are some people cloned but others aren't?  Why doesn't Happy Mask Salesman find his alternate universe clone, for example.  Why is there no clone of Zelda?  It doesn't make sense that the alternate universe world would have exact clones of some characters but not of others and have a completely different landscape, culture, and political system (who rules Termina anyway?  There has to be some governing power but apparently there is none).  Also, when the moon is destroyed, how does that not doom Termina and how does that not affect Hyrule?  And to address your other quote:

&gt; Could also be explained by the fact that every Zelda ever does this, or by the fact that it's an alternate world...

The alternate world idea I have already addressed.  As for the same characters appearing in different Zelda games, you miss the key difference.  In direct sequels (like WW to PH) the same characters appear because that makes sense.  In other cases it is because there are certain bloodlines of Hyrule.  Familiar characters are not exactly the same characters as before, but distant descendants who are similar in appearance or nature, but never actually the same.  In the case of MM, they characters are literally the same.  Yet some of them are apparently exact clones who have never been to Hyrule while others seem to be literally the same people who Link met in OoT (examples include Happy Mask Salesman, Skull Kid, and Epona).  Also, there are characters in Termina who mention having been to Hyrule, yet there are no characters in Hyrule in any Zelda game who have mentioned having been to Termina.  I think that right there is pretty definitive evidence that Termina is not a real place.

It just doesn't make sense that Termina is a real place that you can physically visit.  Where is it physically located?  How do you get there and back?  How do you explain all of what I mentioned above?  Coincidence?  That's one hell of a stretch.  I find the ""Link is dead"" theory more believable than that.  The explanation that makes the most sense is that it was a dream.  There are no conflicts if it was a dream, everything can be explained in a reasonable and logical manner.

**Tl/Dr:
The theory that Termina is a real, physical place that Link actually travelled to makes no sense and brings up so many problems.  The theory that Termina is a dream presents no problems, makes a lot of sense, and fits into the rest of the series.**"

39887,"&gt; And how does that back up the fact that he's dead?

I never said he was dead!  I think the ""Link is dead"" theory is a stretch at best.  I think that the game is obviously themed about grief but most people don't deny that.  I think that the game using the stages of grief as a general theme is reasonable and probably what Nintendo used when making the game.

&gt; You've never heard of a parallel dimension, before? Do you not watch movies or read books? It's a pretty common device.

I love parallel dimensions.  When they are done well.  And I also know about the physics arguing for the possibility of alternate dimensions.  But there are some key characteristics of alternate dimensions.  Usually either everything is completely different, or everything is nearly the same.  In the case of ""nearly the same"", usually there is some reason for the worlds being similar (you mentioned science so I will too: some quantum mechanics theorists say that every quantum occurrence results in two parallel universes that are exactly the same except for the outcome of that occurrence).  In the case of Termina, the landscape is vastly different so there can't be any occurrence that would make the two worlds branch off.  So the fact that there are clones must be a coincidence.  That is a pretty damn ridiculous coincidence.  So if Termina is not an alternate physical universe, and its not part of Hyrule, what could it be?  A dream.

&gt; The Happy Mask salesman was on his quest for Majora's Mask, when he went to Termina. It's not farfetched that he learned of this 'portal' somehow, nor is it that Skull Kid might find it, seeing as lives in the fucking Lost Woods. Or maybe he followed the Happy Mask Salesman to get the mask?

You have a good point here, but that group of characters were not the only ones to have seen Hyrule.  There are some borons who mention having been to Hyrule, for example.  The fact that those Gorons have been to Hyrule and come back, but no one in Hyrule has ever heard of Termina is strong evidence that Termina is actually a dream.

&gt; Because it would be absurdly boring to have the exact same world in two back to back games.

Most of the Zelda games occur in different versions of the same world, with the same layout but altered landscapes because the world changes over thousands of years.  They could have made an interesting variation of OoT world if thats what they wanted.  Also, let me point out that there have been other parallel universes in Zelda before.  They have either been:

* Nearly the same with slight differences (ALttP Dark World, parallel timelines in OA as you change the course of time)
* Completley different with no relation whatsoever (the Twilight)

Note that this is exactly what I was talking about in my earlier statement.

&gt; Why would it? In reality, losing your moon would cause some hardcore tsunamis yeah... but it wouldn't 'doom' an entire world, and this is a fantasy game where real-world physics consequences aren't generally touched upon.

Even in a fantasy game full of magic, the idea that losing the moon would have no bad effects is ridiculous.

&gt; They are the same people... and Epona is a horse. Are you not actually familiar with the story?

Uh, yeah, thats what I was pointing out...  Some of the characters are literally the same people from OoT while others are exact clones.  Given all the exact clones you find in MM and where these key characters tend to hang out in Hyrule, I find it very strange that you never encounter the clone of Link, Skull Kid, Happy Mask Salesman, or Epona.  It seems to me that if they are there then it is highly probable that one of these 5 characters would encounter one of the alternate world clones at some point, having story-altering consequences.

&gt; Time travel and splitting timelines doesn't make sense either, but things like that, and parallel worlds, are common device in fantasy stories.

Yes but it can be done poorly or it can be done well.  If Termina is a parallel world, it is a really poor example of one.

&gt; Where all parallel worlds are? Another dimension?

There has to be a physical connection somewhere.  In the Lost Woods apparently.  If people can just stroll back and forth like apparently the games main characters and the borons I mentioned did, why didn't more people know about it?

&gt; That would be Miyamoto and Aonuma... the creator and co-creator of the series, and its story. If I write a book, you can't tell me that I'm ""wrong"" about how I decide the story should go, regardless of what your opinion is on what would make a better story.

What, you think they wrote the entire book themselves?  You think they wrote it at all?  Of course not, it was done by a team of people.  I doubt either of them even proofread the whole thing, they have better things to do.

For that matter, you think they are the complete experts on exactly what was going on in every game?  Of course not, Zelda games are made by teams.  There is no one person who knows everything about what was going through people's minds when they made certain parts of the game.



&gt;  let me present you with a few facts that simply prove it wrong

All those pertain to the ""Link is dead"" theory, which I have explicitly stated that I disagree with.  They do not pertain to the idea that the stages of grief are a main theme of the game nor do they pertain to the idea that Termina is a dream.

&gt; Except you didn't state any actual problems or holes... just that it was nonsensical to have a parallel dimension.

Let me recap:

* When parallel dimensions that involve clones of people, there is typically an explanation as to why there are clones and how the worlds are tied together.  Usually they branch from the same parent dimension.  Termina could not have branched from Hyrule because the landscape bears no resemblance whatsoever.  For that matter, the moon in Termina has a creepy face and the moon in Hyrule is normal.
* If they didn't branch from the same world, how are there clones?  Coincidence is not a valid explanation.  Dream world is.
* People in Termina have heard of Hyrule but people in Hyrule have not heard of Termina.  Parallel worlds does not explain this.  Dream world does.

&gt; Except it goes against hard facts and things stated by the games themselves

What ""hard facts stated by the games themselves""?  There has been no reference to the occurrences of MM in any other Zelda game.  (Besides the Mask in ALBW which is supposed to be just an easter egg)

&gt; as well as the game creators...

The book was written by the writers of the Mangas, not the teams who made the games.  They are used to making things sound interesting, not strictly following the ideas of the developers.

We've been over this already, but if you must insist that the Hyrule Historia, a book made by the manga writers to make collectors happy, is gospel, then why couldn't ""alternate dimension"" mean a dream world?"
73140,"Well I don't know about you but I prefer my fantasy to make sense on some level.  There is such a thing as shitty fantasy and such a thing as well done fantasy.

Also, we are discussing *game theories* not discussing *taking everything literally*."
75814,"Well in the end you just have to pick how you want to interpret the game.  To me, it makes much more sense that the events of MM occurred in a dream.  

My personal theory is that it was a magically induced dream, possible by the real Majora's mask or some other dark magic, probably to send some sort of message to Link.  This would also explain why the MM songs appear in TP.  The only person in the world who would know those songs is the Hero's shade, who probably chose the songs for the howling stones, so that makes sense."
