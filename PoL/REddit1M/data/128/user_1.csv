3499,"That Tingle is in someway connected to the goddess' and the rebirth cycle. 

We see him as a plush toy in Skyward Sword Zelda's room, for the first time as a floating map salesman in MM, and finally in Wind Waker as a man child map decipherer. WW Tingle must be a descendant of MM Tingle because he still has his map making skills and can read Hylian (Triforce Charts are in Hylian I believe) Obviously he must have some importance for his line to survive after the flood, cause any other sane person would have let him drown.

As for the grief theory, I actually follow that one, but not for the Link is dead reasons, because the Link is Dead theory is laughable at best. I see it more like Link is going through the stages because of all the events in OoT and being forced to abandon everything he knew, he's a little kid and some serious shit has happened, obviously he's gonna grieve, so the game devs threw it in as something for the older players to catch on."

68196,"The way I see it, to Link, the game is all about helping everyone else, he started off looking for Navi then got sidetracked into saving the world and then saving as many people as he could, but to the player, the game is all about Link. I feel that the grief theory makes the player empathize with Link more, but not because of a dead thing, because all he does all game is try to help others in need, he knows he can't save everyone so he has to deal with that, he grieves for all the people he can't help.


That being said, my pet theory is that Termina is a very real place but a different world accessed by magic or a portal in the Lost Woods. I use another form of media to drive this theory.. In the Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian, Aslan tells the Telmarines that they were actually humans from Earth who somehow stumbled upon a portal to Narnia and began living there. My explanation for Termina residents looking so much like Hyrule's being that a group of early settlers must have unknowingly found the portal that lead to a new land where they could live and thrive and eventually have ancestors who happen to look like their Hylian """"cousins"""""
77518,"Hmm, good point. I see it as not representative of his grief, but that the stages are present all over the land because nearly everyone in the game is suffering."
547018,"This makes sense when you think of how Link was sent to Holodrum and Labrynna by the Triforce, only this time it's a bad trip because of the mask."
