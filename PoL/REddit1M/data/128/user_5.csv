12795,"No, i think theyre trying to say that it just talks anout tbe grief process, not links death. The game isnt about Link, In my opinion. The only way you can get all the items in the game is to help everyone woth their last wishes, and only then do you feel the real impact of that moon's impact (pun intended). The areas certainly do fit into the 5 stages of grieving, whether intentional or not (its hard to say). The game is about coping and handling problems, which fits in with grief. "

18482,"I see your point. But I think that you can extend the emotions to the order of the locations you go to. I'm trying to say that while there are mixes of emotions in the characters, there is much more anger in the swamp, for example, than denial; I feel like you're arguing that there's a mixture, and therefore one isn't dominant. If you don't like the theory, I doubt I'll be able to convince you otherwise."

25949,"Snowhead- When talking to Darmani, his actual words are
'As I am, I can only watch as Goron Village is slowly buried in ice…I may have died, but I cannot rest. So, you can use magic? The soaring one also told me that you are able to use it… I beg you! Bring me back to life with your magic!'
Snowhead's residents want to postpone their fate; they ask Link to bring Darmani back, to stop their winter, and even to stop the crying of the goron child. They plead 'Please make him stop crying' and desperately want peace by begging for it.

Ikana is the land of the dead. Nothing else is there except for the girl and her father, but while the other areas required a special form to navigate, Ikana is all about Link and his tools. No new mask forms, no transformations; Ikana is tackled by Link. He is reflecting (mirror shield) on the events that caused the grief and moving forward anyway. Heck, Stone tower has you climbing to the heavens to get the light arrows (enlightenment?) and then when the tower is flipped upside down, he returns to the land better off for the journey."
29119,"Oh, got it. I personally don't follow that part of the theory, so I couldn't tell you. I think that the death of everyone in the world when the moon falls is something Link experiences over and over again, and it mirrors his grieving for everyone's death. I don't know about Termina being a dream world or Link dying."
