30668,"I'm pretty certain the Twili created Majora's Mask. Midna's description of her ancestors (secretive tribe of dark magicians with a knack for creating world-threatening magical artifacts) very closely matches the Happy Mask Salesman's description of the people he got the mask from.

TP and MM are in the same timeline, and the Fused Shadows are VERY similar in both appearance and function to Majora's Mask. They're both transformation masks, both transformations have weird tentacle-ish limbs, and the eyes are nearly identical.

It would seem the Fused Shadows were essentially a prototype for Majora's Mask, and the creation of the Mask and subsequent near-destruction of Termina resulted in its creators being banished to the Twilight Realm."
