0,Please no one say the Link is Dead/Grief theory because we (hopefully) all know it's ridiculous.

It's a mobile link so it may not work right. Let me know if there's anything I didn't cover that you mentioned."

About the MM stuff, heres a link to a paper I did once for school on the topic since I don't want to type out what I mostly cover in it:   https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qjTej3LTbaU0HgdO4mjiQvqUcRTUup8XauV3CelZqSQ/mobilebasic

16741,"But the areas don't fit in to the stages, is the thing about it. For example, the Deku King is in denial when he denies his daughter is responsible for her disappearance, not the monkey. "
17510,"And so are the city council people in Clock Town yelling in the mayor's office.  
Many characters in many locations show the stages of grief. It's because they're common emotions, especially in a game involving the end of the world. They aren't tied to specific areas or people."

56016,"It has more than a few issues. The grief theory and the link is dead stuff that often gies with it is the most debunked, unnecessary, shallow theories that I've heard for these games. Making MM all about Link makes it seems less substantial. If it's not a about the world because the world doesn't even matter, it downplays the severity of the situation. It makes it seems insignificant.  
The theory was unconvincing since game theory first popularized it, and has been debunked by Hyrule Historia over and over again."
