At first I got the impression she was just a brat, but that changed so drastically as I immersed myself in this game. She gave everything to be what she was told she had to be. The final memory brought tears to my eyes, seeing her finally tap into her potential. And to that end, seeing Link lay everything down brought equally strong emotion.

I truly love this game."
