236681,"The number one question i'm asked about Zelda: ""Why keep playing it if you beat Ganon? What else is there? Doesn't it get boring?""

These questions seem to only come from people that have never been immersed in a Zelda or Metroid game. The game isn't over when you kill the last baddie. There is more loot to get, more mechanics to have fun with, more puzzles and side quests. The game doesn't end with the final boss. The final boss is only a trigger for a credits scene.

I beat Ganon last week. This week has been all about shrines. Now I'm moving on to the Medals of Honor. Then I'll do the side quests. Then, who knows, an expansion might come out by then.

Bless this game. It is a proper touchstone in video game history. I hear people compare it to Skyrim or other open-world games, but to be honest, to me those are fly-by-night oddities, and seem drab and forgettable. This game delivers. The visuals, the writing, everything down to the NPCs is memorable. There is probably more that can be said, but words kinda fail me right now. 

Edit: The only annoyance I've had is the fake British accent by the voice actors. But I guess the fact that they cast someone that sounds like Vegeta as King Rhoam distracted me from that *just enough*"
