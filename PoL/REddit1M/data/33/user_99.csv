Most game designers can see the flaws in their own art, and they can think of that one thing they wanted to add they never got to add into the game.

Honestly my biggest complaints of the game are having to watch (or skip) the same sequences over and over again.  It's absolutely charming to watch link cook food the first time.  By the hundredth I'm just sitting there like ""ok whatever just cook the damn radish.""

The actual content of the gameplay (i.e. when not interacting with menus) is about as close to perfect as I've seen in a while.

On the one hand, it's kinda cool that it lets you do the divine beasts in any order.  On the other hand, it feels like there's almost no difficulty curve.  The first blight is hard.  The second is easier, because you have better gear and hearts.  By the third or fourth it's much, much easier, especially if you have the Master Sword.

On the one hand, I love how there are no super specific items you use exactly on the boss.  On the other... the bosses didn't feel very memorable.  Each boss was beat in more or less the same way -- shoot him in the face.

I'd say that's the result of not being able to predict the order you'd face down the enemies, but that doesn't seem right.  The other ""big enemies"" in the game -- Taluses, Lynals, Hynoxes, Guardians all felt like something special.  The various Ganon forms never felt all that interesting and unique.

200 shrines makes for a nice quick burst of play, but shrines are short enough I never felt like I accomplished anything.  Maybe less shrines and more big dungeons would have been nice.  Hyrule Castle is a fun place... the game needs more of those.  Maybe even an underground one or two, since you can bypass a lot of Hyrule Castle by climbing.

It's nice to have a Zelda game that doesn't hold your hand, and this is a *welcome* change from Skyword Sword where everything was just a series of puzzles, but some of the Zelda staples are Zelda staples because they work.

I'd call BOTW a success.  I hope they take this formula and run with it.  Just add a *touch* more structure, a *little* less faffing about, and maybe fine tune the items and weapon breakage a bit."
279122,"I really feel like the Ganon fight (and Hyrule Castle) should have been more of a... thing.

Hyrule Castle does have this awesome winding road... but you can just climb around it and bypass most of it.  All those challenges are largely wasted.

Ganon should have been a final test of everything you had learned how to do to this point.  Compare to Twilight Princess, where the fight is much more of a *thing*, a four stage battle of Dead Man's Volley, then a beast fight, then some horseback riding, and then finally a one-on-one sword match using all the tricks you've learned so far.

This fight, you can beat the boss by reflecting his guardian ray back at him, and hitting him in the face with the master sword (or, really, any sword).  They HAD to make it that easy because there's no guarantee you'll face him with any dungeon items in hand.  You might speed run your way to him day one.

I appreciate the non-linearity but even the first Zelda said no fighting Ganon until you got all eight bits of the Triforce.  Giving us some dungeon specific items that we can also use on the final boss would not be that bad."
