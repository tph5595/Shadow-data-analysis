7946,"Depends on what you want from a Zelda game. The shrines were great mini-dungeons, IMO, and the Divine Beasts were neat new takes on the classic dungeon structure. But for me, Zelda has never been about the dungeons. My favorites are Wind Waker and Majora's Mask. It seems to me most of the criticisms of the game so far have been like this: people wishing something was there, instead of disliking the things that *are* there. 

But if you're into Zelda for the dungeons, I can totally see how you'd be disappointed. I would just say, think of the whole world as a dungeon. "
