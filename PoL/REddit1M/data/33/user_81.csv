Other than that I really enjoyed it.   I do wish that they had more music, and the dungeons just felt incredibly lacking.  If the had put the depth of say the shadow temple, or water temple for each one It would've been absolutely amazing.   I beat Vah Medoh in like 15~20 minutes and was very disappointed.   I'm also sad as shit that I didn't get to rematch the dungeon bosses inside the castle room since I beat all the dungeons before.  

Exploring the map was fucking fantastic.  I enjoyed this games map more than any other open world game of the last 10 years.  Feels bigger than Skyrim by far.  

Solid 9/10.  Could've been a 11/10 hsd they kept some of the classic zelda themes.  "
