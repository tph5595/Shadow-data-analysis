71896,"I was having the same problem, spent quite a while passing time by a campfire waiting for one to happen.

Then I did a bit of searching around online and it looks like blood moons have a scaling chance to happen based on how many enemies you've killed.

I realised I couldn't actually remember having killed anything at all since the last blood moon.

So I went and killed a Lynel or two and a coupld Hinox and went back. Sure enough, blood moon on the second night."
