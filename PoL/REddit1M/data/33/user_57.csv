This is a world recovering from the total destruction of its most prosperous nation; just look at the size and frequency of the ruins near the castle, extending all the way out to Fort Hateno in the southeast, Akkala Citadel in the Northeast, Tanagar Canyon in the northwest, and perhaps even deep into the Gerudo desert in the southwest, although those ruins are probably much older. The world has been decimated in reverse, as probably only one in ten survived the Calamity. I'm personally a big fan of the desolation, and the sense of hopeful rebuilding that the game ends on if you get the 'good' ending."
