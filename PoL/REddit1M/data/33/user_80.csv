Have about 100 shrines now, still a few I have an idea of where are, but feels like when I get down to 5 or something feels like its going to take forever to comb through entire map without guidance since they can essentially be everywhere =p "
190657,"There is one thing that sort of rubs me the wrong way about how this game was received. Because of how critically acclaimed it was, it feels like a lot of people who are either just very invested into other consoles, or never going to play it  feel the need to bring it down. 

One obvious example is Metacritic, where it has 97% by reviewers, but 76% from users. Horizon for example is 89 by reviewers 87% by users. I'm guessing this is mostly caused by people who are feeling left out by how much everyone else is enjoying Zelda and doing their part to bomb the scores so they can feel better about it. 

In the end I guess it is just some form of 'trolling' on the internet and not something to care too much about. "
