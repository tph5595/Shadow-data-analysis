221735,The Spring of Power is the Earth Temple. Skyview is the Spring of Courage.
221773,There's the Sahasra Hills. Don't know too many specific ones beyond that.
221893,"Every game is after Skyward Sword. Theoretically they could put one before it, but this game has Ganon, meaning it has to be after Ocarina of Time.

There's arguments still for each timeline (though the Wind Waker timeline is the weakest). IMO it's after Twilight Princess."
222092,"The thing that's neat about this game though is that they signal little things you could do fairly well. Because it's so open, doing anything could reveal a shrine, a korok, or a treasure chest.

That one is at least in line with normal Zelda logic of using your items to manipulate your surroundings. Not as fake game rumors sounding as placing a rock in a certain spot in a formation of rocks."
222213,"One of Zelda's journals in Hyrule castle indicates that it is a medical facility, meaning that they can't just revive someone who is straight up dead. It's for treating serious wounds and staving off death from a living subject."
222291,"Yeah. They also say that Link is the one who killed all the guardians at Fort Hateno, except Zelda is the one who took out most of them in the end."
222404,"I'm a little annoyed that Zelda basically said, ""Ganon's going to permanently die,"" and then immediately followed it up with, ""We've got to be prepared in case he comes back."""
222479,"Kind of hard to reference ""Triforce of the Gods"" in a game where the Triforce wasn't mentioned even once."
267195,"Yeah but even then, it's only the triforce of wisdom because the full triforce would let then wish Ganon away"
272479,"Sure, but Zelda tends to be deterministic as a series. If they say something it is typically true. That's why they buried the Divine Beasts and Guardians 10,000 years prior, because Ganon was defeated for hundreds of life times."
