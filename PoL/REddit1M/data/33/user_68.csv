172198,"30 year old here, been playing since OOT. Love this game and don't really understand the criticisms.

&gt; epic story

This story is pretty much more epic than many of the others. I don't know where people keep thinking that all the other games have these stories which are so much better? 

People worship MM, but its story is ""weird autistic kid tries to end the world - the end"". Like seriously, there's like zero Zelda lore, but people adore it. Why the double standards?

Links Awakening is another highly praised game with like no story. You are part of a fishes dream? 

&gt; Where are the stellar boss fights, and the varied and unique dungeons?

They're everywhere. Lynels are the real MVP of this game. One of the most fun boss fights out of any of the games. It's not just a rote rite of passage where you take the new weapon and conveniently exploit the weakness of the boss. That old formula is so predictable, why are people clinging to it so strongly?

In addition to Lynels you get Hinox and Talus and Molduga, plus generic silver enemies which put up a harder fight than early dungeon bosses in other games.

&gt; epic music

This is just a personal thing I guess. I love the approach they took to music in this game. It's immersive. You're abandoned in the wild, you don't need a musical soundtrack playing 100% of the time.

&gt; unique dungeons?

Same as the boss fights, I don't know why people are so attached to the established meta. When you look at the story of BOTW then there is no logical way for those kinds of dungeons to even exist. This game is all about immersion which is something none of the others really aimed for. Like when you think about it logically, it's super ""convenient"" that all of these dungeons and temples exist seemingly for the sole purpose of Link to enter in precisely one way, complete in precisely one way, find a boss that fights for Ganon for no particular reason, and complete. Like why? It makes no sense. Which is why BOTW ditched that and went for something that actually thematically fits with the story. 

Additionally, my only complaint is that they're kind of short. But in terms of the whole dungeons being physics puzzles then I couldn't be happier.

These are all just opinions flying around, so nobody is right or wrong, but these are all the reasons that I disagree with not just you, but all the people with the exact same qualms."

177939,Awesome. I'm zipping around the map farming Lynels at the moment and until now anytime I come out in a storm I just leave for a new location.

A lot of the criticisms are similar to yours, but as I tried to highlight in my comment (especially for the story one) I just don't understand how people come to that conclusion."
