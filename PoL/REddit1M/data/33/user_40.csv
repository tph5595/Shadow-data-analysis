58022,"I get that they were going for a more beastial Ganon, but I really think one final fight with the spirit of Ganondorf would be really interesting, and would be a cool callback to the theme of ghosts/spirits/already dead people that the game opens on. "
228342,"Yeah, it felt kind of like we were robbed. I think the feel was for that more generic, LoZ Ganon feel, but we've come to grow with who Ganondorf is, and honestly, I think of Ganondorf as far more iconic and threatening than Ganon itself. Ganon is just a beast, but Ganondorf is a fucking cultured badass swordsman, sorcerer, Triforce wielder, and charismatic. "
