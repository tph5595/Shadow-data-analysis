181376,"I just beat the game and I am beyond disappointed. I can't believe that was the entire game. Not to complain about every aspect of the game because I love exploring Hyrule and I loved collecting items. But I can't believe the entire game is wake up... beat the divine beasts... beat Gannon. The end. 


To me It would be like if OoT was just 3 dungeons and you beat the game once you get the master sword. I was hoping this game was going to be like that where there would be dungeons hidden throughout Hyrule that you never would have found before. Kinda like The Shadow Temple or The Water Temple. As a kid you have no idea about them. 


I'm gonna go back to killing Lynels now....."
