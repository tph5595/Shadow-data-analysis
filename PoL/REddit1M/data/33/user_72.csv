177324,Tbh there should've been an NPC to at least hint at this. I mean I guess one of the sidequests leads to that spot to fight Moldova.

177540,They do nothing. They're completely for a sense of achievement.
177788,"I agree. I like the idea of a huge open world, where the overworld is essentially your dungeon. People don't like the fact that things don't have ""dungeon"" in their name so hey won't call it a dungeon. But each region is essentially a dungeon, with unique puzzles and objectives and bosses. 

After you beat the game, you can load the autosave right before the final battle and it'll have a star next to it, acknowledging you beat the game. The only difference is that you have a % completion on the bottom left of your map screen. There will be a hard mode in DLC in the summer. "
