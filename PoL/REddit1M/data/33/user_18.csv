18224,"I definitely think the game could have had more settlements, that said, all that they did accomplish has been hugely understated in your post. I'm sure given how much they did do, delay after delay, there came a point where they decided it was great enough to be considered one of the greatest games of all time, and shipped? I feel like even with your suggestions people would have still found things they wished could have been included. 

That said, look forward to the DLC packs! When they do come I'm sure we'll see a lot more of that extra push we might've hoped for after *another* delay. "

And then come upon this objectively beautiful masterpiece. I cherish it, and wish we had more. Then people come in and complain and nitpick for this and that. Bitch? Do you know how rare something this good is? Do you know how often GOTY or even GOTD come around? Get ooutta here and get some perspective!"
