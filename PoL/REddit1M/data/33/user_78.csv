186193,"Damn, I ran through this game far too fast. I literally did the first 4 shrines, went to the first village where you get the quest for the 4 divine beasts, and just went straight to them. A long the way I did a few shrines. After I beat those 4, I kinda thought the story/missions would meander a bit, but no...after that I just went straight to calamity ganon.

I mean, its my fault for not taking time, but shit its kinda weird how you get the final mission right off the bat and can just go do it. I should have done the memories along the way.

Finished the game with like 7 hearts, and an extra 3/5s of the stamina wheel. Never got/did the quest to find the master sword. Litteraly did this for my playthrough:

 start&gt;divine beast a,b,c,d,&gt;Calamity Ganon. Found all the beasts' puzzles to be really easy, and to be honest I didnt have to do much fighting throughout the game. I think because I didn't really stay on the paths much. Give me a glider and ability to climb and I'll go up and over as opposed to around every time.


Kind of a shame for me, because the game is great in a lot of ways. Good old zelda charm and feel. Great, tight mechanics. The open world, although kind of sparse, manages to have a ""real"" feel to it. Like you feel the majesty of those plains when yo walk around. Really nice. I just wish it was a bit more traditional in the sense of dungeons and puzzles and fighting.
In those aspects I found it too easy. That bird divine beast I must have figured out in like 10 minutes. As soon as I turned the lights on...oh you can tilt it side to side, oh theres like a roller coaster thing, bet we'll roll a ball down that... Ehh. Kinda just an uninspired boring ass design for a dungeon for a long awaited zelda game.

So yeah, definitely have some mixed opinions on this one. 
Wish i didn't rush through it so much. But damn you tell me to go kill ganon thats what ima do. Like shit... I never even got a horse, haha, No master sword. Not many of the memories. The shrines were kinda cool but I wasn't going to seeking them out when theres a dot on my map for the main objective that I can go to. 

Anyways, I know that must read a bit disjointedly, but whatever man it was just a stream of thoughts I have about the game. I know it probably comes off as I totally don't like it, which is really not true. Maybe I'm just getting old. These open world games are kind of sparse for me. I guess I miss those more dense, linear, difficult kinds of experiences. "
