240256,"Saving up all good weps for the Ganon fight. Buying only 15 Ancient arrows. Divine beasts gets Ganon to half HP and I only used 1 bow and just the anienct arrows to get it to zero. Then on the ""scorpio phase"" u only have to use Urbosaâ€™s Fury 3 x times (insane counter ability for last boss fight) and hit with mastersword between. Done.

And the piggy phase is just dull. 

WHY MAKE LAST BOSS SO EASY. Not a single pot used.

It really made me go ""that it?"""
