145873,"I just beat the game. Only did the elephant and camel (forgot the names...) beasts before going to the castle - I wanted to get a sense of how difficult it was, but next thing I knew I had made it to the throne room.

Fighting the bosses I didn't complete before ganon was a nice touch, and I'm super glad I didn't get what I later learned was the counter ability - I had never really practiced parrys/getting a perfect dodge so it was a trial by fire in the phase 2, but holy hell it was so much more satisfying that way, and not overly difficult

I can't help but be confused by all the people being sad this game wasn't closely following the traditional Zelda formula - I guarantee if it had I probably would have put the game down a few hours in. I'm so tired of what feels like the same game over and over, it's just not something that interests me at this point and I'm eternally grateful the team working on BOTW did something so fresh, even if it wasn't perfect

I'll probably get eaten alive for that opinion considering this is /r/zelda, but man, after playing through 4 of the games in the series I couldn't stomach yet another game that played the same way with it's own minor spin on the formula

EDIT: forgot to mention - is there a NG+/anything similar, or is it ""load before you fought ganon""?"
