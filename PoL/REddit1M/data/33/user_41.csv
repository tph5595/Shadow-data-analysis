60461,"This pretty much encapsulates my thoughts, especially the ""feeling like a kid again"" part. The last few weeks waiting for this game to release had me manic with anticipation like a kid waiting for Christmas presents. 

Since it came out, and to this moment, that childlike wonder has never faded. I've seriously never played a game so filled with adventure, and it never seems to stop delivering. I've actually had several times where I feel like ""it's gonna get old soon enough if I keep playing it,"" and yet every single time I play I end up having an unexpectedly unique experience."
