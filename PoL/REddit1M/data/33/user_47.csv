71214,The Blood Moon quest is a pain in the ass! Seriously I think my game is glitch because after camping 50 times I still get no blood moon. At 91/120 shrines I decided to quit completing all shrines and decided to fight Ganon and finish the game for good. I was hoping to leave it to the end but that annoying blood moon quest changed my mind. Anyone else had a hard time doing this quest?
72119,Im going to try that. Thanks (:
