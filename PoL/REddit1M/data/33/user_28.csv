But where they put so much detail into making the world logical, detailed, and full of things to do, they didn't always make it relevant. I would have liked bigger cities, or at least more interesting cities. Areas like the forgotten temple and that 8th heroine statue deserved more than a shrine and a quest respectively, they deserved some more backstory, lore, etc. It would have been more fun to explore those areas if the incentive of uncovering more of hyrule's past were there.

I wish there were more of this kind of thing in the game, because it scratched my itch for discovering lore and other facets of the Zelda universe. It was so cool that it was designed as an actual castle too, with guardhouses, a library, dining room, docks, studies etc. And it finally had some epic music! After hearing so much subdued music, it felt so good to hear something that really made the moment feel special. If only the boss fight delivered on that level...."
188451,"Yeah, the whole story is divulged to you after you find out the identity of the old man, maybe 4 hours into the game if you're taking your time. I kept expecting there to be some big reveal, twist, or anything to challenge my expectations for how the plot would unfold. But all you learn is more details into the story that you already know. Exploring was incredibly fun, but you never really stumbled upon anything unexpected story-wise. You just continue to uncover the world and get strong enough to kill what's right in front of you. It made for a great first playthrough, but not after. "
