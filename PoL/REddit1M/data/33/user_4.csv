5362,"Has anyone else noticed how the game has reversed a particular Zelda dynamic? In most Zelda games small items (arrows, bombs, magic pots, etc.) are always available when you need them but may not have them, and big items (bomb bag, spinner, fire rod, hook shot, etc.) will often have uses in spots where you don't yet have them. In Breath of the Wild you always have the big items necessary to solve any puzzle or find any reward but can find yourself stranded without simple items like arrows or wooden weapons when you need them in a shrine.

I was doing a shrine the other day in the Death Mountain region where I needed to shoot an arrow through one blue flame to another torch to access the next part of the puzzle - except I didn't have any wooden arrows to use. I had to leave the shrine, buy some and come back. It reminded me of a similar puzzle in Wind Waker where you have to shoot fire arrows at torches in the wreckage of a ship. In that puzzle you're surrounded by pots filled with arrows and magic pots to ensure you don't have to leave to get what you need.

On the other hand earlier games aren't afraid to make you come back later for a prize (for example a heart piece you can see early on in Link's Awakening but can't get to until later in the game when you have the power bracelet). In Breath of the Wild you will always have the basic tools you access about 90% of shrines and Korok seeds, but as I mentioned may lack additional components (the right arrows, wooden gear or otherwise ect.)

I'm not quite sure how I feel about this. Firstly I prefer the sort of patience requirement from these sort of situations in previous games as compared with the situation when it arises in BotW which just feels inconvenient.

I'm not necessarily sure why but I feel like the item rental system in A Link Between Worlds managed this better for the best of both worlds. All items run on the magic meter which refills itself so you're never stranded without small items. Whereas the item rental ensures you can always have the items you need to access any secret. You won't always have the item you need, which requires the patience and remembrance aspect of previous games, but you'll certainly never get stranded halfway through a secret like I did with the Death Mountain shrine.

I'd be interested to hear others thoughts on this - maybe I'm just complaining about nothing."
