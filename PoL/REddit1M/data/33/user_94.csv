227139,"Although I disagree with you on the first two points, I'm with you on the final boss. I only died to him the first time due to being caught off guard, then breezed through it the second time thanks to the Divine Beasts taking him down to half health before we even started. All it takes is the Master's Sword, Urbosa's Fury, and some arrows to finish him off. If it didn't mean wiping out my current save file, I'd totally start over just to see what it's like taking him on without (among other things) the Divine Beasts weakening him and/or the Master Sword.

Similarly, two of the four Divine Beasts were hell to finish, while the other two were a breeze. So, if someone was hoping for dungeons or boss battles on par with past Zeldas, I can certainly see why Breath of the Wild might disappoint them.

That being said, most of us are willing to trade those things for everything else Breath of the Wild has to offer. I mean, the combat system alone amazes me with its wealth of possibilities, to point out something that doesn't get as much attention as the game's other qualities. In the other Zelda games I've played, I felt shoe-horned into approaching enemies a specific way. In Breath of the Wild, on the other hand, there's almost always room to get creative with all the little nuances they added. Like in the making of videos Nintendo released, I realized for the first time that many of the skull-shaped hideouts have hanging lamps you can cut down with an arrow to blow up the explosives cache inside, and that you can use the updraft from burning grass to your advantage. And, if the bosses in the game leave you disappointed, start seeking out lynels. I tried defeating the one in the Zora's Domain quite a few times before giving up and deciding that, from there on in, I'd just run anytime I saw a lynel. Now that I've defeated Ganon, though, I'll probably try my hand at defeating some, since it doesn't feel right avoiding them forever.

So, yeah, if you're comparing it to past Zelda games, it's going to compare favorably in most areas, but unfavorably in a few others, and your opinion of the game comes down to how much weight you give each of those factors. Simple as that. For me personally, it's in consideration for my ""favorite game of all time"" distinction, flaws and all. Yet I also completely understand where the ""disappointed"" crowd is coming from."
