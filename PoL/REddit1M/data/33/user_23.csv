The ""complaints"" I see people bring up don't honestly seem like complaints on what we have but more as a wish-list of things they'd like to see in the future. Sure, I'd love more of the game. I'd love more enemy variety. I'd love some long dungeons. But that says nothing about the game we got, which as far as I'm concerned, is perfect."
