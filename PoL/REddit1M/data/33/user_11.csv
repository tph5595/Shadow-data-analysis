11467,"To be completely honest, I feel a little hurt any time I read criticism about this beautiful game, which I admit is naive and childish, but I can't help it. I know it didn't deliver on every front, but you can really tell that the team behind this game poured their heart and soul into it. It's not perfect. It could be improved. But first of all they put years of their life into making this a memorable experience for us, and second of all I'm sure they knew they were taking a big risk by stepping into the ""open-world"" format and breaking series conventions. I'm not a game dev, but it seems like a difficult and demanding job. It took them years to refine, polish, and perfect the systems that they DID put in the game, and I think that all of the beautiful moments I experienced enjoying the enemy AI, the picturesque landscapes, the wildlife, and the other small moments sprinkled throughout the game made up for the lack of dungeons, lack of enemy variety, etc."

A lot of the criticisms do seem to come from what it's ""lacking"", but specifically within the context of it being a Zelda title. I like to think more about what it brought to the series that hadn't been seen before: a very complex Princess Zelda, very advanced enemy AI, more unique armor sets than ever before, the temperature system, cooking, and so much more. I all thought these were really interesting and innovative features.  

People complained about Skyward Sword too (which I'll always defend), and they are complaining about this now. The games are pretty much polar opposites in terms of design philosophy. I think what would be really neat to see next is a blend between the two - the open world concept and sense of exploration with some long, meaty dungeons hidden away. :)"
