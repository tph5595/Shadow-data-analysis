19447,"I finally beat Ganon and feel like I can safely wander in here. Anything left for me to be spoiled by will be things I legitimately missed or never got around to doing.

Vah Naboris was the only divine beast to give me trouble. Got stumped on a couple of puzzles at first, and the boss put me through the wringer. (Praise be to full heal cooking.)

I think I'll take a brief break from BOTW to play Andromeda, but I definitely want to try and get all the shrines and inventory slots eventually."
