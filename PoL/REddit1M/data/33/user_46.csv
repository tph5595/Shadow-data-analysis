This game runs terribly, way more often than I have the grace to allow.

My friend and I compared notes, and it seemed to be less often for him (perhaps a newer WiiU?), but I had near-constant stutter in all settlements and all stables. Frame drops whenever more than 3 or so enemies were on screen. I even had three lockups of at least 4 seconds happen in 1v1 fights versus moblinsâ€”each long enough that I thought the console had frozen. All I did was Stasis+ the moblin and wail on him with a sword, but each time as the Stasis wore off I got a heavy hit sound and then total static image.

I can't think of another AAA release I've played since the PS2 days which ran so poorly. Again, I loved it, and I love the series, but this is unbelievable."
