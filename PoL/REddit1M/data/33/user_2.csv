4729,"same feeling that you, at least 2 more dungeons will be great, and not open air, I want to be in a confined space, exploring a temple like indiana jones, they lost a big opportunity here, also there are not caves in hyrule at least not a big underground cave, a big cave full of luminous stones would be nice with a boss battle somewhere there(and not a talus). another flaw is the variety of not weapon wield enemies like spider and other monsters, there are only chuchus, octorocks and keeses(different colors does not count). also some areas like Farons and hebra lacks of sidequest missions and history, It shoul be nice to include a tribe of deku there or village of Yeti in Hebra but still with all this problems IT is my favorite zelda game and videgame, I love it"
