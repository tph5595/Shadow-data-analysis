20805,"I get a little hurt too. The game isn't perfect, but it's easily the most ambitious title in the series and has so much life and personality in it. I feel like people are criticizing it because it departs from the familiar. People like what they're used to. "
25808,"I agree with most of your points, especially your sentiment towards skyward sword. Skyward is a top 3 zelda for me. It had everything I wanted. A creative combat system that really immersed me and made me feel like Link, compelling boss fights, complex dungeons, great side characters, and even greater zelda. However it didn't have the exploration and overworld botw had to offer. You win some, you lose some. But Nintendo always seems to listen and respond to criticism well with their next 3D games so I know for sure the next zelda will feature a more traditional zelda game with the open world and freedom incorporated.

26541,"I was at 119 shrines and tried forever to find the last one in gerudo desert. I eventually had to use a guide and found out that you had to **shrine spoiler** light the torches in an area you fight a molduga. I remember feeling somewhat pissed and relieved simultaneously. The shrine beeper didn't go off near it so there was no way I could have found it on my own, but I don't get why it didn't detect it. It's such a well hidden shrine. "
26966,"True. Given how big hyrule is, I feel like the population is only like less than 200 NPCs. One more big town would have been great, preferably in Faron woods"
27199,"Botw gives me such a strange sensation. I've put in over 120 hours so far, finished the compendium, 120 shrines, upgraded all possible armor except the one you get from getting all the shrines. When I'm away from the game I feel like I've gotten bored, but when I actually hold the game in my hand, I can't let go and play for hours and hours. I just can't put the damn game down even when I've explored almost all of hyrule. It's such a complete game "
56152,"that was the first thing I did after doing the divine beast. I grabbed every single side quest I could find in the town during morning and night. Was definitely one of the most fulfilling things I've done in the game, especially considering the gerudo area is my favorite and that I didn't have to bother with thunderstorms anymore."
202654,Yes. Lightning doesn't hurt you whatsoever 
202705,I had to look at a map that counted all the shrines by zone. I feel like it would have been impossible to find the last shrine without that help. And I still needed the help in the end
202779,Honestly I think you found the hardest shrine in the game. I don't remember another shrine that was so hidden like that
278048,Let me know which side quests you've done in gerudo town and I'll try to give you non spoiler hints on the ones you haven't done yet
398794,You're missing just one. The person you need to find is present at night and not inside a building
412559,Actually my mistake! You find this person during daytime to trigger it.
