140675,"I thought it was great. I played it completely blind and thought it was very satisfying to explore Hyrule and stumble upon everything naturally.

I played it on Wii U.  I was originally hesitant because I thought I should play it on a Switch (which I don't want to buy yet) but I took a chance. The Wii U version ran perfectly fine. There was a few areas where the framerate dropped but never to the point of impacting the experience. If anybody else is struggling with the same issue I'd 100% recommend the Wii U version.

I think it was interesting how they innovated the Zelda gameplay. It was still undeniably Zelda with the shielding/attacking and sidestepping, yet it also felt fresh with the amount of freedom in movement you had.

For my ranking of the 3D Zelda games that I've played I'd say it's like this now

* Wind Waker HD
* Breath of the Wild
* Ocarina of Time
* Majora's Mask 3D

If they do another game in this style my advice would be to ditch the weapon durability system and make a few more lengthy dungeons."
