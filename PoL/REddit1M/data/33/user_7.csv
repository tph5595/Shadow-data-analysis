9644,"Overall the game is amazing. The open world and gameplay is the right step forward for the franchise. However it suffers in a few aspects. 

One is story, it's not bad but it does feel weak among the series. The champions I wanted to know more about, while the side characters and ganon felt like "" oh yeah you guys"". Even the master sword felt lacklustered, you get and it's shiny brand new when 100 years ago it devolved into an ancient rusted dull blade. It seemed when you find it, it would be up to you to restore it but nope it evil sealing ready. 

Second is that the world felt barren. The villages and the beast I have no issues but many of the landmarks felt like wasted potential. For example the akkla fortress, the eighth heroine statue, and the forgotten temple could have been dungeons. Even some of the areas felt pointless like the snow peaks, or even the beach/swamp asides from shines there's nothing else exciting there. 

Lastly the final boss. Yeah it was cool to see the beasts melt ganon spidy but then half his health was  gone and so goes half the fight. Maybe after that  if ganon transformed into a phantom that took shape of his former self then you fight the dark beast maybe it would have been better. 

The game is Amazing overall, but if they do another open world I'd hope they expand on it 

P.S just finished the last fight again and one thing hit me... why did we get the bow of light at the last second? It's seems like lazy game design, if that was the weapon we needed then why bother with the master sword. "

Bosses I had no issue I just wanted more and lynel are more fun to fight against but I was able to get the timing Down to avoid a hit then counter with fury attacks. It's just comes down to player and adapting skills. 

For me I played a lot of dark souls, fallout/elder games so I'm used to having many locations to enter and explore. I know it's Nintendo but Zelda has so many iconic locations and lore id had hope they would import them into the game. Especially since they referenced skyward, OoT and twilight it would be cool to revisit old areas and see how they would have looked in this version. 

I'm only comparing the game in the story aspect. As each 3D Zelda presented a well told story. I know with an open world it would be difficult to tell without forcing a linear path on the player since skyward literally choked it down our throats but there are ways to show a coherent story in this type of world "
