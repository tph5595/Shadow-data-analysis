After you finish fighting Gannon in the castle and appear outside to fight ""giant pig ghost gannon"" Epona appeared next to me and I rode her into battle.  Now this was not a total shock as I had unlocked Epona with a Amiibo.   

Just curious for those who fought Gannon with out the Link Amiibo.... Did you fight on horseback...if so what horse spawned for you to use?"
