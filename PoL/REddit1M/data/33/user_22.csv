21218,"*EDIT: re. the ""getting old"" thing, I do wonder what the average age of posters on this sub is (not condescending, just curious). I too have been feeling old...

I agree with you on the very last point (varied and unique dungeons; I have two Divine Beasts left and very little motivation to complete them since they're just completely tedious) but I disagree on the rest.

I first played OoT back when I was 11 and only made it to the octopus mini-boss in Jabu-Jabu's belly, though I watched one of my brothers beat the game. I picked it back up again last year at 28 and played through OoT, MM, TP, and SS. I have had a very, very hard time caring about many of the stories in these games- BotW is the first Zelda game in which I've been completely enthralled with the story. Maybe that it's the fact that I can relate the most to this Zelda or that the game feels more grown-up than previous iterations...who knows. I'm enjoying the hell out of the story though and it feels a lot more mature than other titles I've played, which helps me not feel so...old. Ha.

I LOVE the music in the game as well. It's scare, sure, but it just fits so perfectly- the dragon music is my favorite, but I really like the urgency and ominous feeling that the Lost Woods/labyrinth music invokes. Hateno Village is also a standout for me, as is the music that plays when you reach towers- it's somehow depressing, unsettling, and perfectly fitting for those desolate, abandoned places. And if you think about it, none of the music from previous titles would work here- it's too heavy. As much as I would have loved to have heard the Song of Time in this game, it would be too overpowering I think.

I enjoy the less-formulaic nature of the boss fights in this game- while fun and interesting, I thought the boss fights in SS and TP especially were formulaic and easy. 

That said, that's your opinion so I obviously don't think you're *wrong* in thinking that. "
