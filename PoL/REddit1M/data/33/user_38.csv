57540,"I have been playing this masterpiece since release but just now beat Ganon. 100s of hours and I didn't want to beat him out of fear of not playing anymore. I am 33 and have been playing the franchise religiously since the start. It has been a long time since I played a game that has made me want to keep going and going.

I feel like a kid again. I remember what it's like to just play a game and have fun. We have been gifted this masterpiece from gamers who loves gaming. Cherish it and enjoy every second because how can this not go down in gaming lore.

It felt like to me some sort of mix between Metroid, Skyrim, Final Fantasy and of course Zelda. I never thought I would see or be looking forward to a patch for Zelda or expansions... 

Last thing about the styling. It was a perfect blending of styles and the animators knocked it out of the park. Everything is gorgeous and I still find myself taking a moment to awe at how the engine set up certain scenes while wondering around.

I do miss the traditional dungeon but honestly, the shrines, finding the shrines, and the various puzzles albeit easy were a lot of fun.
