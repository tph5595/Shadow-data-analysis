5205,"I keep thinking how cool it would have been if Link recovered a memory at each of the springs and the flashback was a playable dungeon where either the player controls Zelda or Link with Zelda as a companion that will help when enemies attack or stay put if you tell her, similar to the way Wolf Link is controlled. I also think the Akkala Citadel would've made a great post game dungeon.

As far as towns go, there are so many ruins spread around the world, I think it would've been awesome if after buying the house in Hateno, Bolson Construction workers went to each of the ruins and asked you to clear the place of monsters so they could start restoring the town. These could be side quests similar to Tarrey Town, but with a little variation in their requirements for each one. Then after restoring the town, it's inhabitants could give you a few more side quests. Maybe something more satisfying than ""Bring me some goat butter and I'll give you a silver rupee.""

I absolutely love this game the way it is and I'm happy with the finished profuct. I just can't help thinking of ways that it could be better."
