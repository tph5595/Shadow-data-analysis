151425,For me I like that Link gets some established backstory but it seems that he has more character interacting with NPCs than in cutscenes. I suppose it's the norm for 3D Zelda games though.
151786,I'm curious to see if they improve from here though. The game is simply outstanding but I'll be damned if they manage to create a new map and game with the same feel to it but with a better story.

(Also somewhat related: In the song he plays the theme from Twilight Princess is used before he plays the main Zelda theme. I didn't notice since it's much more upbeat.)"
