1590,"....I'm disappointed. 
I finished the main quest and ~85 shrines, and at this point I can see a ton of missed potential that makes me sad. Don't get me wrong, I had a ton of fun with every hour I put into the game. But I just can't see how they made a world this big, with this much exploration in it, and they only put four dungeons in it. And they're all super obvious, and super quick to get through, and almost no fighting. It just doesn't feel like Zelda. The world exploration is great, and the shrines are a ton of fun. But they just don't make up for the lack of dungeons. Similarly, the lack of villages and settlements is disappointing. Right after getting off of the plateau you get sent to kakariko, then they send you on to hateno. And then since you're in the same region you're relatively likely to discover that other village south of hateno. It gives the impression that there's villages sprinkled everywhere. And then there just aren't. There are more stables than settlements in hyrule. Why are stables conveniently spread throughout the world when there's nobody living out there!? In my opinion each stable should have been a small town of some form or other, and there should have been some more hidden away in little hidden places. The Woman's hut who does snowboarding? should have been a little snowboarding camp. The dessert oasis is a perfect example of a ""tiny village"", and there should have been a lot more like it. "

Given the emphasis on exploration an open world dungeon like Hyrule Castle makes perfect sense, and that was easily one of the best locations in the game. Given that it makes no sense to me that they went back to closed off dungeons for the divine beasts _and_ didn't make them much larger and more involved. The comparison to MM is obvious because both had four dungeons and a final area. But the MM dungeons are _involved_. These four were not at all. One puzzle mechanic that drives the whole dungeon, the same repeated 'visit five stations then fight the boss' pattern, and a fake openness by having them move around the environment but require a loading screen to transition in and out of. They just fell very flat for me. They would have been great if they weren't the only four dungeons in the game though. As far as progression flow goes, comparing it to other Zelda's, it felt like the divine beasts were the ""pre dungeons"" before you hit the turning point in the game and then more stuff opens up, usually much more complex stuff. This felt like the game should have encouraged you to get to each of the divine beasts a bit faster, then once they're all unlocked they hit canon with their mega blast, he transforms into something else, a whole new set of over-world stuff comes about, and then you go do the proper game.

Or a story as big as the house-&gt;tarry town side quest? Or ""go get goat butter""? Similarly, is the dungeon they're giving is if a similar nature to previous Zelda's, or to a divine beast? If we get a tarry town + divine beast for $20 I will be hugely disappointed. "
19139,"I like that idea. I really wish they had done more with zelda. The marketing and hype for this game really made zelda out to be a character. In practice all we got were a set of cutscenes to flesh her out a bit. Having portions of the game be playable in the past would have been wonderful to help build her character. Similarly, rescuing her from ganon before the end of the game and then having a period where you prepare for the final fight together would have been great too. Really anything besides her being a McGuffin in a tower. "

92841,"It's fake development though, because she's not really a character in the game. She's literally just a memory, who we as the player interact with in zero ways. A good game ""shows you"", it doesn't ""tell you"". The memory system is the opposite of that, it tells you that you should care about her, but it doesn't give you any motivation to do so. It's little more than an intro cinematic that was chopped up and hidden throughout the world. To get a real appreciation for Zelda as a character we would need her to be in playable segments that actually affect us as Link. They tell us she's important and that she struggles, but in terms of gameplay she's a faceless nearly voiceless entity in a tower. "
260924,"You're right, Skyward Sword does an excellent job of this, but it's definitely one of the weaker spots of Zelda titles in general. However I think that BOTW is a standout in being bad at this. 

In my opinion Twilight Princess does a good job of setting up motivation: we start out doing it for the village kids, and then we transition into doing it for Midna. Meanwhile Midna derives her motivations initially from selfishness, then guilt, and then altruism, it's a proper hero's journey for both main characters. 

Wind Waker sits somewhere in the middle, where the motivation is derived from saving your sister, which is better established than in BOTW but not nearly as well as TP and SS.
