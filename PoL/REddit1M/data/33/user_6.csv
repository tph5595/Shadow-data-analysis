8395,"Do you remember which shrine? Thus far every time I've used an arrow in a shrine there was an alternate method available too, although sometimes circuitous"
21437,"Ah yeah that one. Excepting the platform moving vertically behind the grate (which I suspect also has a solution that doesn't use an arrow: I just didn't find it) I was able to solve all of the other flames using time stop and/or by throwing my torch to a dry platform and walking through the water without it. 

Edit to add: apparently the vertical platform behind the gate is not an unlock platform and is optional to light so no arrows are required with judicious use of time stop and a willingness to let go of the torch at key points. "
