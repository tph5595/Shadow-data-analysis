9587,"Twilight princess bro! 

Obviously the overworld in this game is better. There's no debate. But I'm missing (real) dungeons. The fire temple, sky dungeon, desert dungeon (with the ghosts and the spinner!), and the temple of time were all so damn cool. 

And how cute were the yetis in the ice dungeon!?? 

Yeah I've had some unbelievably amazing moments in the open world of BOTW, and it's one of the best games I've played, but it's hard to say it's the best Zelda because it's missing a lot of what i loved about the old Zeldas. "
9780,Goddangit bobby that's a vidya game! I said no vidya games!

I literally look back and I'm like... ""is this it?""

I went across and got the chest but like damn. I got to the exit in less than 30 seconds"
14951,"Definitely. I also wish the shrines looked slightly different depending on the province. The only difference is what the priest...weird...skinless dude at the end looks like. 

Different skins for the different provinces would have been a nice touch. 

Kinda sucks climbing the top of a huge snowy mountain and going down into the same grey room again. "

I guess it wasn't that great of a dungeon. But when I think of the end of that game I remember that place, the badass battle with the dragon using the double claw shot from the sky temple, and the land of twilight (which was boring tbf but aesthetically really cool)"
30313,"I guess I just loved the varied locations and themes of dungeons in TP. In BOTW we get a super varied over world but the things you do in every region are really similar. Whenever you're solving puzzles, you're either in a shrine, or one of the divine beasts, which are similarly themed. 

You can fight goblins and lizals in the snow, in the desert, in the jungle, or on death mountain, but you're still just fighting goblins and lizals. 

FYI I love BOTW but I'm very cautious to call it the best Zelda ever or even a 10/10 (the frame rate alone kills the 10 for me)"
