Now I can take down the Blue Lynels no problem. I liked not being comfortable in the world but now I have enough equipment and medicines where not sure anything is really a threat to me anymore.

And I've only done 1 dungeon, and don't have the hylian shield or master sword yet. So I think there are lots more upgrades to go.

The statis to freeze enemies, the monster masks, and the high-level defense and attack potions were mistakes IMO. They're really unfair to the enemies and make life pretty easy. I know I can just not use them to artificially up the difficulty, but I kind of wish they didn't exist. Who knows what new tech there is out there that I may add to this list too...

Hopefully I'm missing some future elements of the game that will bring this back into balance"
