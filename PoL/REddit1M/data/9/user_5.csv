Then I'm gonna get the last 2 memories I'm missing in Hyrule Castle, and then I'm gonna beat the final boss again (already did it a few days ago). I plan to turn on the pro hud mode after that and just run around and live in this world doing side quests and killing monsters."

If not, then I guess I can say that such a strong shield and iconic symbol of the franchise lies in an appropriate location. Where I found it is where I would expect it to be found."
3586,Yeah one is just south of the castle
3656,My friends and I discussed how to open those doors for a while before we got it. Good luck!
