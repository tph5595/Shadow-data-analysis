3114,"I've beaten two dungeons (Zora and Rito) so far, and I've gotten the Master Sword. Now I'm doing some shrine hunting, and I love how I'm still finding mysteries in this game.
&amp;nbsp;

Yesterday I just explored the Hebda mountains, and I found a giant stone door that has a shrine behind it, according to my sensor. No idea how to open it (don't spoil it!). It reminds me of playing ALttP and seeing the crack in the pyramid. I knew I was going to get in there, but had no idea how."
