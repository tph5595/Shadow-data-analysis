27273,Okay does anyone know how I can get permanent cold resistance? I'm trying to get to Rito Village but my torch and Warm Doublet can only go so far.
43030,I forgot the name of the region but northwest from Central Hyrule. It's freezing up there.
81325,Would it be smarter to read Rito Village going north from Gerudo? Going through Hebra ends up being really counter-productive since it's just as cold too.
95403,Through Hebra?
96415,I'm missing the southwestern region which I'm assuming belongs to the Gerudo. There's the northeast with Mount Doom and Korok Forest. I've unlocked everything else.
104801,Thank you so much man
