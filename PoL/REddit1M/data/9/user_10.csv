3775,"Not sure how many hours I've put in, but it's more than most of the games in my Steam library (feelsbadman.jpg)  

So far, I've got:  
1 Beast (Zora)  
16 seeds  
37 shrines  
The Master Sword  
Outfit of Time  
Outfit of the Hero  
Outfit of Twilight  
Twilight Bow  
Biggerons Sword  
Epona  
(Note: I only have the following Amiibos: SSB Zelda, SSB Link, OoT Link and 30th Link)  
A home to call my own  
Hylian Outfit  
Soldier's Outfit  
Gerudo Outfit  
Snowquill Outfit  
Zora Armor (I'll look for the other pieces soon)  
Warm Doublet  
Champion's Tunic
All but 1 Tower  
7 memories  
9 Main Quests done  
1 Shrine Quest done  
4 Side Quests done  
51 items in the Compendium  
1 Great Fairy Fountain  

And with all that, I don't feel anywhere near complete. I'm super addicted, trying to get everything I can in the game. I can't imagine the amount of times I've died in the game, and most have just made me shrug it off or laugh a bit (the Combat Trials, on the other hand, can bite me).  

The only gripe I can think of at the moment is that I wish I could bet more than 100 rupees in the betting game. I'm sure there are other little things, but nothing that doesn't take away the joy of the game.  

EDIT: Added a few more outfits I have."
