11195,"lol I probably should have, but I just grabbed it last night after 44 shrines and 2 dungeons completed. I don't regret my 3 upgrades of stamina though."
29272,Meanwhile I'm sitting here thinking how the GC version was much superior to wii.
29405,"I mean, once you find the master sword, many people start focusing on hearts just to pick it up."
29475,There isn't. It just loads you in before the final boss. It does add a star on your file to show you've beaten the game at least once.
29533,"We're going to have to disagree about temple of time. The mini boss was amazing, but climbing 8 floors, grabbing an item, and going back down? That was kinda tedious for me in retrospect."
29595,"Or like SS, which was very story driven, especially close to the end."
29667,"Yeah, the one to the left of central hyrule was a pain the first time I went. It doesn't help that lightning storms occur there often, so metal items are a no no."
29833,"Better than me. When I saw streamers get it a day or two before the game came out, I thought it happened every death and made Link invincible."
29893,"Timing is pretty bad. I keep practicing, but I've only got it once xD. Now I just go in with some guardian weapons and hack away."
30095,"Definitely agree, City in the Sky's boss is super memorable (Double clawshots? Yes please), and I def. agree with your grievance against the Palace of Twilight."
30149,"I think I took out two of the wizards, ignored the lizalfos, and just climbed up asap. It helped since I went after getting a second stamina upgrade, so jumps could be made."
85192,"It's partially just what I played first. I don't really like the flipping, and feel like the motion controls don't add too much to the experience."
