8059,"&gt;I've been mispronouncing it this whole time

I had a similar experience with Kakariko village. In my head I always said ""kuh CARE ee KO"" and the old man says ""KAH kah REE ko."" It makes sense given that the game is originally japanese, but I've spent 20+ years with the wrong pronunciation in my head."
26229,How do you pronounce Zel**da**?
29482,"Okay, so either a) you're lying, b) you're pronouncing Zelda wrong, or c) you've misunderstood the sound I'm talking about. It's the same sound as in Zel**da**, Ca**nada**, **tra**ditional... I could go on. I already admitted to making a mistake; you're not going to make me feel foolish for thinking that the 'a' made a sound that the letter 'a' sometimes makes in this language."
