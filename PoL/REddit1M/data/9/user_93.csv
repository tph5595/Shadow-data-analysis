69968,"I'm working out of town during the week, so I don't get to play BotW at all =( Which makes me sad as I can't really participate in these threads.

What I *did* do, however, was digging up Zelda 1 on my 3DS. I had downloaded that on a whim a few years ago and got stuck pretty quickly. BotW whetted my appetite for some free roaming though, so I booted it up again, and am now playing it pretty much blind, as I never owned the original(or the console for it).

And I gotta say, as someone who constantly compared BotW to Zelda 1 pre-release, the similarities are *even more* striking once you play it. The only difference, really, is that Zelda 1 has barely anything to do for you than pure, raw exploration and combat. No fun physics experiments, no elaborate raid tactics.

But the core is there. And so I'm playing this as a stand-in for BotW in my free-time. Call me crazy, but it actually does the job really, really well.

Some people say they might be harder than dungeon bosses, except they respawn in Blood Moon nights and give some very rewarding loot, which to me is the perfect recipe for some fun action in the midst of all the exploration."
