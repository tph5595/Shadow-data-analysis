39067,"I Think this is one of the best games Ive played since phantom pain. I love the reviews its getting but I would give it a 9/10 only because of the framerate issues and also the controls are sometimes a clutter, for example, the camera, zooming and marking things and just going to your overview map is all done by different controls when it should be the same, personal pref, but its got some issues , until they fix the framerates, 9/10 great game though"
