9798,"Only about 15 hours in. I have a bad habit of searching *every* inch of *every* mountain before moving on, so I just got the Slate+. I know the first memory is [some distance in front of Hyrule Castle](/spoiler) judging by the picture, but a guy told me the rough location of the ""snowy mountain with a gate"" memory. So I figured that'd be more fun.

I play at night. After my fiancee goes to bed, and always end up limiting my sleep ""on accident."" So around 12:10 am, I come out of the snowy wilderness to find a grassy clearing, hoping this is the one. I can find the memory and go to sleep accomplished. And in the distance, a fucking centaur notices me, stares me down, draws his weapons, but doesn't charge.

I've been steering clear of spoilers so far. I don't know what this is or who this is. So I switch out my armor, and mentally prepare my ""good"" weapons. Silver Longsword, Eightfold Blade, and a Guardian sword. For good measure, I down a defense meal and slowly approach hoping for a nice chat.

What proceeded was a 15 minute battle to the death. I shattered every good weapon I had, along with 2 sledge hammers, and a traveler's claymore. In the end, I had a rusty halberd, was eating frost resistant stuff for hearts, and resorted to shooting bomb arrows from a distance. By the end, I had the timing the ""bullet time"" dodge down only to use it to run away, glide up an updraft, and fire another bomb.

Somehow I didn't die. Somehow, after shattering nearly all my weapons, I managed to fell the beast. But it was worth it. For a single mob, in a single field, it was worth it.

I didn't sleep from adrenaline. I love this fucking game."
