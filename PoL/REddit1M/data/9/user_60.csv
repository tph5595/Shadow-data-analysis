23171,I think this is exactly why the Eventide Island Shrine was so refreshing. I haven't gotten all the shrines yet but it doesn't sound like there are other shrines like that one.
24015,I'm really glad I did Zora's first. The power you get at the end is just too good to not have.
25026,"I can't freaking wait for hard mode already. I think most of us dedicated players are ready for it but I think it's good that Nintendo's putting it in later so all of us get reeaaal familiar with the game before they toss it in.

I just hope they do things to make the game more interesting other than up enemy health/damage. Make enemies smarter, make guardians take less time to line up their shots, and hell maybe have them LEAD their shots when you're running in a constant direction(cause while they were scary at first, after getting used to them their ridiculously long wind-up just seems silly for ruthless killing machines), make food less effective, remix combat shrines to make you take on multiple guardian scouts at once, make drowning/getting stuck in bog/falling into a pit in a shrine an insta-death, make Yiga clan warriors be less susceptible to throwing bananas at them, make blood-moons a full night event, etc. etc."
