Revealing map locations is a big part of it I think."

Like 4 of the region's I've realized I have zero shrines and very few location names revealed."

Personally I hope it's not another 6 years until the next Zelda game, and they really follow up this one properly.

Either way I'm excited for gaming. I hope other publishers look at the world of BotW, the sales, the reviews, and push their games to be more gameplay focused and less on 4k textures with every post processing option under the sun. 

If you make a game like that, where you can spend your money on the world rather than more pixels, their game can come out on the Switch and sell more than it might have only the PC/PS4. (Building a library of indies to cultivate a consumer base on the switch helps prove there is money to be made on the Switch as well)."

I only have Gerudo and Zora, and I disable the lightning attack pretty frequently."
