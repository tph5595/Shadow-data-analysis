83086,"I encountered my first Lynel in the same place, only it happened at the same time as my first blood moon, so I was scared shitless from the music and the fact that this menacing beast was staring at me from down the road under a dark, crimson sky. Then, it got the yellow exclamation mark and started walking towards me, so I just said ""FUCK THIS"" and started sprinting up the mountain away from it. Luckily I didn't have to fight it, but I felt legitimately frightened in that situation."
