32704,There's around 30 Hinox's throughout the world. They are slow and easy to kill. Respawn with every bloodmoon. 
46517,"Naw. There's even one quest where you have to kill 3 (or be very sneaky)  There's also like 15 stone talus too, at least that I have found. "

The best fights are when you can find one on horse back. Those you can ride right between its' legs and sticking for double damage. "
