7576,"re: getting to Zora's Domain. You can skip 95% of the enemies by climbing the walls of the narrow path, and then just staying up there the whole time. You can climb even when it's raining. The only time I came off of the walls was to cross the bridges (and you can float down to biggest bridge right before the Zora's Domain, skipping a good bit.)  I think, grand total I killed 5-6 lizalfos and the one moblin that shows up after one of the cutscenes where the prince tells you that you're on the right track."
