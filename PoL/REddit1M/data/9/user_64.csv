27858,"I think I've got close to 40 hours. I've mainly just been trying to fill out the map and find shrines and seeds. I haven't done a divine beast yet, but I do have the Rito and Zora quests going at the same time. I'm taking my time. I'm a mom to 3 kids under 7, so I can't really throw myself into something that requires all my attention. I'll probably take on a beast this weekend when daddy is home. I do love this game so much. It's cool that my kids like to watch me play."
27925,I didn't need anything but the warm doublet to get to Rito Village. Which way are you going?
39618,"It says 40 hours, but I'm not sure if that's because I will save and pause and leave it and switch the cable on. It doesn't feel like I've legitimately played 40 hours because there just isn't really enough time. I played a lot over the weekend. Get a couple hours in when the older two are at school. Maybe a bit after they go to bed. They are by no means neglected because of a game if that's what you're suggesting. I'm not constantly on the game."
40856,"Well, I spent a lot of time playing over the weekend. My fiance pretty much took charge of most of the kid  stuff because he knew how excited I was. Also, I'm a stay at home mom. So, I can play at nap time. Then after bed time. So, I guess it isn't impossible. It said 28 hours Sunday night and that WAS impossible, so I'm not sure about the count, tbh."
