62194,I tried storming Hyrule Castle as soon as I finished the four divine beasts and getting the master sword. I stocked up on food and arrows and everything and I got destroyed at the second Lynel. This is hard. I'm not afraid of Guardians anymore but Lynels are more difficult than the -blight ganons. I wanna know what happens. My friends just told me i just have to git gud.
