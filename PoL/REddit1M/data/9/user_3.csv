1518,Lol I must be about 60 hours in and I too have only done 2 dungeons. Simply don't feel the rush to do them as the world is so so interesting. Also I'm scared of finishing this game and never having fun with any other game again lol.
9825,"I think that's what I had when I did my first one. Either 4 or 5 but either way it should be easy for you to find new shrines to upgrade your hearts. The starting areas have a lot of them in plain sight. On a different note now I have 15 hearts and some decently upgraded armor and I'm finally starting to feel like a badass, at least in some areas. Lynels still fuck my shit up though lol "
9924,I still haven't unlocked 4 areas of the map. I like the mystery of what's to come and once I do unlock a tower I like exploring the area thoroughly... Still miss a fuckton of shrines though. 
21205,"We'll have to see about that... Hard mode doesn't really do anything for my curiosity, and the story dlc will have to be very fucking good. Just thinking about zelda dlc makes me a bit sick tbh "
