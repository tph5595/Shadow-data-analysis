9642994,"This game already is good enough to make believers out of the most non gamers and gamers alike. I had tried, to no avail, to get my girlfriend into video games. Many times over, with the classics: Final Fantasy VII, Ocarina of Time...you name it, nothing seemed to click. I was disheartened, as these are some of my favorite games, but I realize that sometimes you can't win certain battles, and so I stopped trying.

Then I got a Switch for my birthday.

I was playing in the living room one day, and she came in and just naturally became engulfed in the game (I think we may have been trying to figure out a shrine puzzle together?). In any case, BOTW was the drop of water that broke the dam. From being completely disinterested in Zelda before after experiencing OoT, she now initiates Zelda sessions...I couldn't be happier."
