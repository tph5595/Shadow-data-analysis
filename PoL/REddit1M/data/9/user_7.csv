2413,"I'm 3 dungeons in with only the Goron storyline left to go, and I gotta say, the Zora storyline was by far the hardest of the 3, which is kind of disappointing considering how this is the first of the 4 for a lot of people including myself. Some comparisons:  

* Zora storyline - Getting to the city was a pain. You're pretty much forced to go through most the enemies on the path to the city since you can't just climb and paraglide your way there because it's raining. The Lynel quest was difficult because a lot of people felt forced to fight it unless they used their creative minds to figure out they can sneak around instead. The Lynel is also one of the hardest enemies to fight, even amongst the dungeon bosses. The ""mini-game"" before you get into the Divine Beast was the longest of the 3. The dungeon itself was pretty difficult, though I think the other 2 are at least even in difficulty. Then the boss was easily the hardest of the 3 for me because of how difficult it was to maneuver around when there's water everywhere.  
* Rito storyline - The city is probably the farthest of the 3, but it's not hard at all to get there because you can just paraglide through everything. Practically no enemies on your way there if you paraglide. The mission before the mini-game is ridiculously easy compared to the freaking Lynel. You just have to hit 3 targets in the air. The arrows are given to you instead of you having to go retrieve them. The mini-game before the dungeon is so easy it's almost funny and it can be completed in such a short time, not to mention you can clear this mini-game only using 8 out of the 20 bomb arrows you're given. The dungeon is pretty difficult, but the boss is really easy. You have so much maneuverability during this boss, and you have at least 10 free bomb arrows you can just wail into the boss. 
* Gerudo storyline -  Getting to the city is probably the most fun and interesting of the 3 because of how you have to get in and the different temperatures you're dealing with in the desert. The Yiga hideout is easy in most aspects. The path to the hideout has quite a few enemies that can be pretty annoying, but everything after that is simple. The stealth portion is beyond short and not very challenging, and the boss was a joke (literally). Once again you're hand fed 20 bomb arrows, and the mini-game is so short and requires only 8 again. The dungeon is not too difficult, but definitely harder than the Rito dungeon. The boss is actually pretty fun because you have a little puzzle during the fight in the second phase of the boss fight, but besides that he's not very hard to beat.  

On a side note, the Tarrey Town quest was fun and great in every way. 10/10 would quest again. "
2461,Only one memory is in the castle. 
4724,Yeah I'd say so. You get something at the end of the storyline that will make your life so much easier. 
42718,I had the exact same problem with the Zora beast. I guess I missed the most important tip during the dungeon. 
42840,"I just finished the Goron storyline last night, and I think that was the hardest and the best overall, and it's saying something because I hate fire-based levels. "
