While I like my wii u and will most likely like my switch more than my Xbox and ps4, they are ""niche"" systems in that they have phenominal first party games, and games you can play with your friends. (Mario party, kart, smb, etc) Todays generation can't appreciate Nintendo like we do. I showed BOTW to my friends kid and he said ""yea it's good, but imagine what it would look like on an xbox"". It's sad that todays gaming generation just cares about super realism, and bigger guns for their online games. They don't know a real adventure like Zelda and Mario. "
