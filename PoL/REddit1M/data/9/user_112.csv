962351,I knew about shield parrying way before I actually had the guts to try it.  First time was against a flying guardian around the Akkala Citadel / Tower area and I did it perfectly on the first try!  Probably the most satisfying kill I had in this game.  Turns out I was just lucky the first time though.  5 minutes later I cockily tried it again and got murdered.  Can't wait to try to run straight for the castle from the Plateau someday and parry with a pot lid.
962812,"&gt; Framerates need to be improved. Moblins when knocked around actually stall the Wii U for a second.
&gt; Custom mapping of controls.
&gt; Not enough monster variety. While the monsters will equip with stronger gear the further you get in. It does get somewhat repetitive to fight the same one.
&gt; Lacking ""building"" locations in the game. I wanted to see more interior places to explore like the Colosseum or cave systems. Be nice to explore more hallways and rooms. I guess it sorta falls in the traditional dungeons.
&gt; Is there a graveyard? I didn't see one. Sorta miss the spooky part of Hyrule with ghost and redeads.

I just beat the game for the first time and I think I agree with all of your ""things that need improvement.""  None of these ruin the game but it would be really cool to see them improved with DLC.  The lack of a graveyard (unless I missed it) is a big bummer.  I was really hoping to see some Poes or Redeads in this game.  I guess that goes hand in hand with the lack of monster variety.  "
962864,I did Medoh second and have no regrets.  Revali's Gale really does make the exploration a lot easier. 
963320,"I'm sure at this point you've gotten through those doors?  What did you think?  I had a relative over and let them play on Saturday and they stumbled upon the door and we couldn't figure it out either, but I found the solution last night and went inside.  Really cool. "
