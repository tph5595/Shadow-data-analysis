""pebbit"" is such a cute word, i feel bad killing them"

7561,"rito village was kinda meh with the design and layout, but the music is fantastic and a great nod (and the area it's in feels so hardcore).

zora i was incredibly impressed by when i got there, but after visiting other towns i realized it's kind of disappointingly small and life there seems vague at best."

i have one dungeon (zora) and almost all the towers (i've been completely neglecting mount hebra because it just sounds so cool), and i'm only missing two memories (collecting that one memory this early was a mistake... hot damn that was tough). i can't choose which dungeon to complete next, but it'll either be gerudo or goron.

i'm really impressed with how much... stuff there is. and how it feels great to get it. and how it feels great just to walk or ride or fly towards getting it. when i first got off the plateau i was a bit worried by how quickly i was able to close the distance (since things are much more wide open and gradual than in that ""compact"" tutorial area). but once i got into the world a little bit and made progress towards completing my first dungeon i found myself completely absorbed.

it's an amazing game, certainly among the best i've ever played (and a serious contender for the spot)."
8298,i remembered exactly where he is because he literally just watched me die last night when my shield broke and i rolled down the hill to my death :l
