6183,"Honestly after the you get the Rito dungeon power up you can cheese through a lot of sections and puzzles, not sure how I feel about it. I was hoping the stealth section in the Yiga clan would be longer; it was way too small compared to the Gerudo Fortress in OoT.

Also wth is the Tarrey Town quest?"
7544,"Beat the final boss, not sure on my hours as I don't have it with me. The final battle was pretty damn awesome, although I fucking hate horse riding in this game (gone through the whole thing without using a stupid horse) Haven't gotten back on to see if there's a post game or if it just reloads a save prior to the final fight.

The four ""dungeons"" of this game are... interesting. All four of them are basically one big room, with smaller compartments and many different ways to use the beast to puzzle solve. I'm not sure if I like them, as the puzzles are pretty dang simple and you can beat a dungeon in less than 20 minutes. The bosses are... meh. Just reskins of each other, and none were very fun. I guess I liked windblight the most since all the lasers looked pretty neat. Clearing out Hyrule Castle was a freaking blast though. It's a much more traditional dungeon than the divine beasts, yet has a feel unique to BotW. Since climbing and gliding is a thing, this dungeon presents you with a massive combination of possible routes to take. Personally, I hunted down as many guardians in the overworld as I could find, and made the shield, bow, twenty arrows, and the chest and legs of the armor (didn't have enough cores for the helmet, so instead I traded luminous stones for diamonds then made the diamond crown for guardian resist). I made sure all my abilities were off cooldown, the master sword was at full power, and assaulted the castle head on. An absolute blast to beat Calamity Ganon's stronghold through sheer force, but you can definitely stealth, swim, glide etc. and do it the smart way.

I'm not sure how many shrines I've done, but I have fifteen hearts and a full ring around my stamina wheel. Personally, shrines are incredibly unmemorable for me. The only ones I remember are the ones that took me awhile; so the only two I vividly remember are a puzzle where you turn fans to get a bunch of windmills spinning and the stupid ass ""device"" ones where you use motion controls to move some fucking balls around and it sucks. I've done... three major combat trials I believe? They were alright, good source of high level equipment.

My favorite shrines so far are the side quest ones. Eventide island was fantastic, as were all the mazes. The mazes were a fuckin blast. The first time I saw one on the map (the far north one) I knew it was a maze and I knew I was going there. Let's see... the dragons are neat, but there's very little to them aside from the blue one. Death mountain was... interesting... since I did it last i had a ton of food which was good. Even wearing full gerudo heat resist armor and eating heat resist food I combusted. I ended up just tanking it with full restore food until I got to Gordon city and bought the flame breaker armor. No idea if there's a better way to do that but it worked (and the armor shopkeeper was freaking out since I was on fire and whatnot.)

Great game thus far, 9/10."
