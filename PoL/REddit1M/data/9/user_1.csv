19,"I can't get over how amazing this game is. I'm about 30 hours in and this open world is so damn immersive that I've only done 2 dungeons. Been too preoccupied doing anything and everything else I come across along the way.

I got myself the Master Sword. I fought and killed my first Giant Talus and Hinox - flawlessly I might add. I'm now capable of flawlessly beating the Major tests of strength. I'm now a Hylian Homeowner and have rupees on tap with the bowling game. I own all of the elemental clothing and have it all upgraded at least once.

I'm just in love with this game. I'll do 3 more shrines so that I can get my 10th upgrade and complete my second stamina wheel, then head over to the Rito's and do my 3rd dungeon."
2551,"There are those little Talus's that are Links size, then there are the boss fight ones. Not sure if I got the name right, but I'm talking about the boss fight ones."
2659,"Ooh I got a hint for Hylian shield but totally forgot about it until you mentioned it. Without fully spoiling it, can you point me in the right direction? Wouldn't even know where to start now that the hint is lost."
3760,"If you can point me to that dude, yes thank you."
4360,"There is a way to tinker with your upgrades. I temporarily removed all of my stamina upgrades to get the sword, then put them back again afterwards."
6906,Ah gotcha.
7347,Tyvm!
8537,I freaking love that you can and did die like that. I can't wait to see someone throw together a 500 ways to die in BOTW video.
9448,"Yep, no problems. I was back down to 9 hearts minutes after I got it."
11323,"I'm at 37 shrines with 5 hearts and 4 stamina. Will be going to 5 and 5 shortly. After that I may stop with stamina though, since I can just use potions if I ever need a stupid amount."
11478,"When I encountered my first Hinox I had no idea what it was, but it was fast asleep so I snuck up behind it with the stealth clothes and used the Goron Hammer with a charged spin attack and depleted all of my stamina in doing so. Insta-killed the thing. I was stunned when I found out it was a Hinox since from what I heard from NPC's I expected something as scary as a Lynel.

What does the *actual* fight go like? Assuming you don't just cheese it like I did."

11800,"No spoilers, just a name. It's called a Lynel :)."
