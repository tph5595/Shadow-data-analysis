2465,"I'm at about 20-25 hours, and I still haven't tackled a dungeon, but I did take down hinox so at least I've done that.."
3694,"So, you'd suggest Rito town first then? I'm indecisive of my next move, I've been just clearing out shrines and encampments in the kakariko/lanaryu/hateno area. "
6839,"I see what you're saying, but I would do zora before goron just because I assume there's some sort of water-based reward for Zora which probably helps fire enemies?"
7477,"You sir, are a baddass. That is fantastic, did you feel like you were the lead in an action movie? "
8148,"I feel somewhat similarly, I'm about a third as far as you in hours and i haven't hit any dungeons yet. I've gotten pretty proficient at cooking, but I only have 4 hearts, not sure if that's enough to tackle my first dungeon. "
9251,Damn right you did!
10784,"Yeah I keep hearing about how bad the lynels are! I've done about 12-16 shrines, but I put more into stamina so far so climbing and such would be easier. "
14619,"Thanks for the info! And for correcting my wild speculation :) So, doesn't really matter if I do that before the fire area then.."
43514,30?! I thought there were like 3. Jesus this world is huge. Finally beat my first stone talus. 
53255,"I just spent half an hour dying repeatedly against a black hinox, wasted all my arrows and couldn't take him down. Damn. "
87399,"The one I found was near horses last night, but they were too skitterish from him to let me mount them. And I was trying the run between the legs method but one in 4 times he would stomp me. "
93649,But I don't have Statis+ yet..
