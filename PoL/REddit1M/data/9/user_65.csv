 After beating them I run into the toughest fight of the game so far, as a white haired zebra striped Lynel 1 shots me through my quite tough armor with his shock arrow, triggering Miphas grace... Halfway through the intense battle a HUGE, red dragon flies above me in the sky as the battle rages on. Never seen anything like it. I lose three knight's shields and a bunch of weapons I'm the battle but I do manage to finally bring the beast down... Let's just say that the rewards were worth it. 

Does this game ever stop with surprises and challenges? Nintendo has really outdone themselves,even by their lofty standards!"
