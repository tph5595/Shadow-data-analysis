A little off topic but I got spoiled pretty hardcore by Yahtzee's(Zero Punctuation) review of the game. Is it really such a big deal that you get help against ganon when finishing the dungeons. Is it an ""aha! moment"" or ultimately not a huge piece of the story? I haven't got into the story yet and am just wandering around."
