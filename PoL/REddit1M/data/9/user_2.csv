990,"Almost halfway with the shrines, and Master Sword achieved, finally! Next up are Faron and Lake tower regions, then moving to Gerudo/Wasteland. I'm not really looking forward to this one in particular, because getting through the desert is tough. And hopefully this weekend I'll finally, *finally* tackle Vah Medoh. :P It's been taking wayy too long. I'm having so much fun though. I'm just itching to move forward with plot. I can't wait to see the next Divine Beasts, they make my little designing heart so happy. 

Still two towers left, as well. I've been putting off getting that one on the left of Central, with all the wizards dancing around it? I've been there twice, unprepared, and I died a lot. 

I'm still not sure if I want to get all the Korok seeds before moving towards endgame territory. I don't think I'll have the patience to visit 900! places before fighting Ganon and having all other plot done already. I'm not having too much inventory trouble so far either, so I won't really *need* it. We'll see. After about 60 hours, I have no desire to stop yet."

29966,I finally got it just now. Just hammering at it with arrows and then rushing up with climbers gear. Definitely my least favorite.
