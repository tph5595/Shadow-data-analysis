The Gerudo desert, Lost Woods, the cold mountains at the northwest, Akkala, and Faron are all brilliant areas that made me push my respect for the game even further. I find the plateau adequate as a tutorial area but very boring in comparison.

I did find the Rito and Zora villages and surrounding areas somewhat uninspired compared to the other cities in the game, but the rest has been stellar thus far."
