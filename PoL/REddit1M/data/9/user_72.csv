35319,"The Witcher 3 is the gold standard for quality of quest writing and design. Every quest felt handcrafted and meaningful, and the world was actually worth exploring. It's one of the few games that has had the size of a Ubisoft experience, with the quality of most linear titles. 

I think Zelda is just as excellent, maybe more in quite a different way. For me it's the first open world environment where it feels truly worthwhile and amazing to strike out in a direction and just explore. All of the numerous systems come together to make every time you pick it up fresh and unique. It's really quite special. 

Really it is apples and oranges. Witcher 3 is a heavily story driven RPG experience that delivers an incredibly built universe and cast of characters. Zelda is an action adventure game focused on the magic of exploration and discovery. The only real thing they share is the open world aspect. "
