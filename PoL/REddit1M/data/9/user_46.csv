14488,I honestly would have preferred a few traditional dungeons to the many shrines. Though the shrine puzzles are probably the best in the series.
14660,I ended up doing that. I've actually done quite a lot of evasion in this game.
14839,But the brilliant ones really do feel like you're back in a dungeon again. Like the one I did recently where you have to manipulate a boulder into rolling into some doors to open them. It's interesting how many variations on such a simple idea they manage to find.
101340,"There was this one moment when I found these gigantic doors in the snoway wastes that was really exciting. I thought I'd found the entrance to a dungeon I'd be entering after saving the beasts, much like I found Raven Rock in Fallout 3 long before I got to that point in the story.

It was exactly the kind of moment I'd been waiting for... But it turned out to be another shrine.

I spent hours just looking for the Deku Tree and the Master Sword and managed to narrow down the search on my own, and that was pretty awesome. I'd prefer to have that experience with each dungeon.

All in all, though, BotW is definitely a step in an extremely promising direction."
