12898,"Having nearly completed the main quest but no where done with the game (finished 3 dungeons, 56 shrines). I stand by my statement that this is one of Nintendo's best Zelda games. Not perfect but I can see myself replaying this game many times in the future.

My big list of favorite features are

*  Nice collection of weapons. I love the elemental ones thrown in have a bonus effect. Thunder weapons are my favorite for it's stun/weapon dropping abilities.
* Everything has a purpose. Even the little critters are worth capturing to help make elixirs. The divine beast not only look cool but manages to cram a cohesive dungeon inside.
* Game just makes sense and I never feel like I need external help (player's guide, internet). Example, finding particular ingredients for elixirs (like heat/cold resistance) can be found in opposite climates.
* Manages to replace hearts with a better system of cooking. Cooking is both easy and fun!
* The world is beautiful. Every part feels unique visually and the time of day just adds so many way to see Hyrule.
* Rock climbing is pretty slow but you get a better view and a chance to glide.
* The complete freedom of the game.
* Surprising long game (About 50 hours in). I think much of that is travel time and all the distractions but it never got overly boring.

Things that needs improvement

* Framerates need to be improved. Moblins when knocked around actually stall the Wii U for a second.
* Custom mapping of controls.
* Not enough monster variety. While the monsters will equip with stronger gear the further you get in. It does get somewhat repetitive to fight the same one.
* Lacking ""building"" locations in the game. I wanted to see more interior places to explore like the Colosseum or cave systems. Be nice to explore more hallways and rooms. I guess it sorta falls in the traditional dungeons.
* Is there a graveyard? I didn't see one. Sorta miss the spooky part of Hyrule with ghost and redeads. 

Definitely a 10 in my book."

I do agree that I still love the game. Even after beating it I can see myself jumping back in years down the road because of everything else it offers. Just small things I wish they were there and were not. For a game about a post-apocalypse Hyrule it should of been a little more haunted. At least the environment did a great job reflecting this with ruins and dead guardians."
