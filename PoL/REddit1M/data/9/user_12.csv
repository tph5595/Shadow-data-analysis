4487,"**total time logged:** 46 hours, 23 minutes. Played 12 times total

**Divine Beasts Conpleted:** 2

**Shrines completed:** 30? I think? The game doesn't keep count. 

I'm scared the magic is starting to wear off of the game. The area around the plateau and Hyrule Field feel like the developers mostly allocated their efforts into those regions and then kinda half-asses the design of the rest of the map. It's harder to find places of interest anywhere else. Also, I'm at a really weird point in the game where my equipment is strong enough to tackle the earlier enemies with ease, but not strong enough to get better equipment. 

Every now and then I revisit the plateau for nostalgia. I teleport to the Shrine of Resurrection, and then walk down the trail thinking, ""Man, remember when I cut that tree? Oh, and the old man was sitting right here! I took his baked apple and he got on to me and then laughed.""

There are still some regions of the map that are uncharted for me, so I'll go explore them and see if they're worthwhile later. For now, I'm waiting to see if there's anything I missed near the Twin Peaks. "
5422,"Lost Woods and the Faron region were pretty cool. The Gerudo Desert *(btw, now the game has voice acting, I realize it's pronounced ""guh-RU-do"" and not ""JERU-do"". I've been mispronouncing it this whole time)* I think brings out the worst case because there's not much you can just walk in on or be distracted by. The sandstorm and temperature shifts make the navigation interesting though. "
6523,I did Zora first then Gerudo. Planning in doing Goron and Rito next in that order. Seems like the best route considering the item progression.
