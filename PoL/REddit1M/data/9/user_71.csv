33285,I think the only thing holding it back is the voice acting and the writing for the voice acting scenes.

35864,"It's too bad. If this had studio Ghibli level attention to drama, then we're talking about a real breakthrough piece of art. A game you could get people totally on the outside of gaming to take seriously. Not that that is so important to achieve. It would have been interesting for gaming as a medium if it did."
45611,"Oh great. 

They should not have done voice acting. It's marring the experience. It's like everytime Mipha's Grace saves me, I shudder."
100613,It's the main way how they tell the story -- it's a major element that defines the game.
100641,Have you heard Mipha yet?
101492,"That's true, and they are wonderful. It just so happens the moments they point too as THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO THE MAIN STORY are terrible. Worse than any film/TV I've seen in a long time. I think the game will be considered a flawed masterpiece in the future. After all, design elements can be replicated. Story cannot."
109831,"No, you're right it's not game breaking. I think though it's masterpiece breaking. I can imagine this game with a better written, directed, acted story and have it truly be a masterpiece, the kind of piece that nongamers would get into. Like how _Spirited Away_ or _Akira_ is for anime. "

I stopped playing months ago, when the game's patterns became apparent, and what magic was there dropped. Kudos to you and your gf for still enjoying it -- wouldn't want to take that away. "
