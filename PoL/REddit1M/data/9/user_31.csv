9656,"Here's a gripe I have with the game that I haven't seen mentioned. Menu controls are the Japanese one and it's reeeeaally interfering with my ability to play other games atm. &lt;___&lt;

Typically, games in the US and EU have made it so that the bottom button (A on Xbox, X on PS) accepts in menus and the right button (B on Xbox, O on PS) declines. Japan however is the contrary, such as the control scheme of BotW, where bottom is to decline and right is to accept.

So yup, if I try playing other games at the moment, I tend to cancel out of menus instead of accepting and it takes me a good 30min to get re-used to those.

Outside of that, the game's awesome! Loving it! I'm getting close to enough Hearts for the Master Sword and then I can start doing dungeons a bit more! I'm curious to see if there are different dialogs when Link has the sword or not. Since my boyfriend's kind of following the story without caring too much about the Master Sword or shrines out of the way, I can see both sides and compare!"
