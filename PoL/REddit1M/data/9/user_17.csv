6149,"I've freed all four Divine Beasts and today I'll be tackling a few more shrines, along with that lightning trial, before making a break for Hyrule Castle.

I love Zelda. This is and always has been my favorite video game series. Majora's Mask was one of the first video games I ever played as a child. Now as an adult, I've played almost every single game in the series. None of them have been better than Breath of the Wild. This game is just so incredible.

The only negative thing I have to say about this game is that I don't want it to end. However, I'm also super excited to fight Ganon. The end game is one of the few things I haven't accidentally spoiled for myself yet, so it should be awesome."
