9112,I'm onto my 4th page of clothes. It's unlimited space.
9194,"You get guardian weapons, does it matter if you lose some other random weapon?

Alternatively, if you're up to it, then use the Master Sword."
9292,"Yeah, this. They're super easy actually. Flurry rush the first phase. Float and hack the second phase. Run/Dodge the lasers and then hack and slash the third phase. Taking a single instance of damage is unheard of."
9405,"You can run on lava. Not the stuff you can sink in, but you know, globs of lava that are on the side of the road that would otherwise deal damage."
9488,"They're checkpoints, this becomes a lot more relevant for another similar quest later in the game."
9596,What is Naydras activity schedule? I just set it free and would like to begin farming it for my armour upgrade.
12861,"I keep pretty much exactly this:

1. Master sword

2. Great flame sword

3. Flame sword/spear

4. Great thunder sword

5. Thunder sword/spear

6. Great ice sword

7. Ice sword/spear

8. Guardian sword++

9. Guardian axe++

10. Royal sword

11. Royal sword

12. Royal sword

13. Royal claymore

14. Royal claymore

15. Regional trash

I use the master sword until it breaks, then switch to my regional trash until it breaks, then switch to my electric spear and jab the nearest enemy and steal their weapon and beat their ass with it.

The fancy weapons are for the fancy foes. I use the two handed stuff like claymores to just insta-kill hinoxes before they can stand up."
43768,Yeah there's tonnes. There's at least another page that I know of.
49747,"I beat it without the memories, then watched a video of the alternate ending because I didn't feel like doing it again. The difference was minimal."
49832,Does anyone have a link/resource which has all of the upgrade costs for clothing? Trying to figure out what I can sell/use which won't leave me short on clothes upgrades.
50126,"Yeah. Honestly I'd just say to do what I did. Beat it as you see fit, then just watch a video of the extra bit."
52499,"Thanks, yeah I know, I'm even reticent to go below 100 since level 4 upgrades can get costly. Just really wish there was a list somewhere that showed me everything."
53380,"Absolute legend, thank you!"
62095,"No I don't have any amiibo, perhaps I miscounted, I'll have to go back and check later. Could've sworn it was 4 pages but maybe it was 3."
69921,"Anyone found a good Hinox/Talus map guide yet? There seems to be nothing good out there...

Yesterday someone linked me [this](http://imgur.com/AABxipg) but it only has 32 Hinox locations so it's not exactly helpful."
69988,You upgrade existing clothes at great fairies.
78395,"I tried that one initially. I'm sure eventually it will be a great resource, but right now it kind of sucks. It's missing huge amounts of stuff and these bosses are part of it."
