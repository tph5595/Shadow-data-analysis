I just tried and the ancient arrows didn't seem to do any considerable damage (?) I took several head/eye shots with no real effect, am I doing something wrong? I'd love to know before I take on Hyrule Castle tonight.

On the plus side , I just found out that as I've been avoiding those shrines since the beginning of the game, my weapons are much stronger / I've got gud in the intervening hours, and realized those guys are easy af to dispatch through normal combat."

I took on the castle for the first time this afternoon and had the same problem until I made certain to hit the eye dead on. For some reason I was under the impression that the ancient arrows were insta-one-hits regardless of accuracy."
