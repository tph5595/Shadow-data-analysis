Honestly, its driving me insane that my motion aiming bugs out every time I start my game up from sleep mode."

It somehow corrects itself automatically now, where previously it was stuck drifting until I do something about it, I just play a bit further now and eventually the aiming works again.

Hoping a patch is en route to better optimise it regardless!"
