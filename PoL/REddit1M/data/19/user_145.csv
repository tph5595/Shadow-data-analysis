I find it incredibly comfortable to hold the joycons separately and have my arms wherever I want, not tethered to a single unit. But then again the Pro Controller is absolutely amazing and has built in motion control so that's also a good option.

As far as framerates, I'm led to believe it's a little better on Wii U, but I don't run into many problems, and it's always been playable on the Switch, even in docked mode. Only one area so far that as pretty garbage. Undocked is noticeably better in foresty areas."

Also I don't believe theres any divine beast in the bottom right. If you talk to Impa she shows you their locations. (I think selecting the quest itself will do this to)"
