16016,I'm still early into the game(6 hours played) where do I get better armor? So far I've only found two helmets which either make climbing easier or give me shock resist but both only give me 3 armor. I bought soldiers chest piece and Hylian leggings for a total of 10 armor but I assume this is really low right? I also have the Zora armor because I did the elephant divine beast but that's it.
