2957,Yes
14640,"The first number is the value of the weapon you have equipped. The second is the value of the weapon you are looking at.

They are Guardians, one of the more difficult enemies of the game. You can and should dodge around them in the early game."
14988,"With the exception of weapons that are historically tied to a named character, every weapon can be found an unlimited number of times. "
16397,"It's pretty low for the game overall, but pretty much right for where you are. You get to upgrade your armor throughout the game, it might be a good idea to upgrade at least once. Go back to Kakariko and talk to everyone there."
16608,"&gt;I think one number is the weapon strength and the other is durability or how much strength is left?

Read the other responses to your question."
17152,"There's a side quest line that feels pretty big and could easily have been a main quest. Without spoiling much, you can start by talking to the Hateno villagers about Mount Lanayru.

Ancient Cores are one of the rarer drops from guardians; the easiest way to get them is through shrine chests. They're just generally the hard one to get (well, second to Giant Ancient Cores, if that matters).

IMO the best gear for combat is the Champion Tunic and Soldiers set, the Climbing gear is great for exploring, and the Sheikah set is great for running around at night or for collecting critters. I didn't find much use for the rest outside of location-specific needs, but I like completing the sets and upgrading them all."
17334,"Yeah, I do my best to reply with minimal information for the reader to pursue themselves, but it doesn't seem to matter when someone else comes along and more explicitly explains what to do."
18236,"If you leave and reenter the shrine, it should reset everything."
19030,My favorite ~~bone~~*boom*erangs
24578,How might you make all of the trees the same?
26611,Look at the apples in each of the trees. One of them has fewer apples than the others. Remove apples from the others to make them all the same.
27628,"Are you enjoying the game, by the way? I've seen you in a few of these question threads and you seem so frustrated all the time. I hope it's not a bad experience for you."
28093,"You need full hearts. It's a nod to old zelda games, being a feature of the original Zelda 1."
28262,Voe meeting? Are you talking about the guy who sneaks into the Gerudo village?
28650,"I don't think so, since they respawn during a blood moon. Some of them are linked to sidequests though."
31285,"Oh... No idea then, sorry! If you find it, let me know - and I'll do the same."
31735,"If you finish the Kass sidequests, he gives you a pretty good idea."
33426,u/flugelbinder01 is this what you're talking about? I remember seeing it posted here so it sounds like Riddim is right.
33482,I can't find any blue chicken statue in Hateno... do you have any more details? 
34928,"The Great Fairy Fountain is the only place to consistently spawn multiple fairies. However, the game doesn't seem to spawn any more once you have 4-6 in your inventory."
37553,"When he's all done learning the ancient songs, he heads back home to Rito village. 

If he's not there, you may need to complete one of the shrine quests there."
42583,"Oh! It sounds like you're talking about the blue furnace. It's only used to light the torches on the way to the Laboratory. You can light all of the torches in town to make the town look pretty cool, but nothing comes of it. "
43009,"Any wooden item, including regular arrows, can be used as a torch - just hold them up to a fire. If you use arrows, you can pick them back up again before they burn up if you are quick. 

If you're not sure if any of your weapons are flammable, step outside of the Beast (where it's much hotter) and open your inventory. Any weapon that is smoking will catch fire when equipped, and can then be used as a torch. 

Otherwise, you can leave the beast, teleport back to the Shrine of Resurrection, and pick up the torch by where you first meet the Old Man. Then you can teleport back to the Beast and keep going."
45880,Don't worry... pretty sure everyone spent an unhealthy amount of time thinking something would happen if we could just find the *goddamned last torch to light*
46125,"It's the one who sends you on the Seven Heroines quest. If you haven't found her, she's in one of the houses. 

If you have found her, and are wondering how it helps you at all... the hint is meant to get you to see what a Heroine statue looks like, so you know what you're looking for with the Eighth one. If you're still having trouble.... [Look at the Seven Heroines on the map to get an idea what they look like from above; you can now scour the Gerudo Highlands area from your map, and see the same pattern.](/spoiler)"
46694,"There's a small hole in the cliff face on the east side of the mountain, over the lake. It's about 1/4 of the way between the crack you can see the shrine through, and the secret hot spring to the north."
63608,"They are correct. Farosh hangs out in the Gerudo Highlands, near the lightning bolt pattern on the cliff face. 

Din is in Eldin/Hebra."
63817,"A better place for Farosh is on the bridge near the stable in Faron. He usually spawns above the waterfall right at ""morning"" and ""night"" if you wait by the cooking fire.

However you may not be able to get a horn, if you haven't met Naydra yet. If you haven't, and want to try for a horn anyway, can you let me know how it goes? I'm trying to confirm whether you can or not. Thanks!"
64707,Those are the easiest farming locations for sure.
65229,"What, like, just now? He must browse reddit."
