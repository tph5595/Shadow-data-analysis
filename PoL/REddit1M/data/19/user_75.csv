16922,"When you get into the Hyrule Castle area, the map changes to a 3D mesh of the castle and hill, and there are a number of archways visible.  These indicate points of entry into the Hyrule castle interior, some of which will be blocked by malice, in which case you need to enter other archways and approach from another angle.  I did my exploration of Hyrule Castle right after a blood moon, as I believe the malice pools respawn.

So far, the main points of entry that I've discovered are: 

Below and to the west of the main bridge is an archway with one of the groom trains inside.  This leads ti the lockup, which also has a hole that can be reached by rock climbing.

I believe the East Passage likely refers to the docks, which are reached by a secret passage in the Library in the eastern part of the castle, although the true exit is in the north of Hyrule Castle.  It makes sense that the royal family would leave by boat.  However, I believe there may also be an additional tunnel in the east, which could also be the East Passage."
