2417,At the Lab in Hateno if you lit them before speaking with either of them then the dialogue was a bit different and she didn't pretend not to be in charge when you first got there since she assumed you had part of your memories.

2. Guardians.  They are tough.  As far as how to kill them read the following.  There is a special kind of arrow called an ancient arrow that kills them one hit way later in the game.  The easiest way to kill them without the arrow is parrying their laser blasts.  If the guardian is stuck in the ground one parry will kill it, if it's walking it'll take three.  In order to do this you have to push A at just the right moment.  Best way to do this is listen for a beep they make right before they shoot, it's one single beep.  Push your A immediately after that beep, don't try and watch the laser to judge it, it's too fast.  This can be done with any shield.  If you miss, you will die, just fyi lol."

16024,"When you have a shield out pushing A does a ""parry"" if you time this to enemy attacks you'll reflect them back or stop them and leave them open for an attack, depending on the enemy.  So for the guardian push A RIGHT after you hear the beep before the shot."

I know this thread says warning there will be spoilers but I try, and appreciate others that try, to mark a lot if info as spoilers so it's blacked out.  I agree that some of the best stuff in this game is discovering things on your own.  I like asking questions but only general kind of stuff I don't want to know crazy major spoilers.  This game really is magical and the discovery is part of that."
