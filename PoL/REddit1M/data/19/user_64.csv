15817,"Poster above is wrong, there is a quest and it's called ""By Firefly's Light"". I got mine from her by waiting till nighttime and talking to her at her home. You might have to finish some other quests in Kakariko before that one becomes available. First Impa quest and the great fairy one come to mind."

If you hover the cursor above the shrines, it tells you their name, so it's easy to find one if you've already completed it."
16814,"Have you found Tarrey Town? You gotta do some quests before it appears, I mean, is founded. There's one on a cliff next to it. I'd say that one is the closest one, northeast of Kakariko"
