42612,"I just remembered mr. Aonuma said the would be different endings but iirc I didn't see any quest where you could make a choice so I'm guessing these endings depend on completion rate or something like that and if so, since I've done a lot, there might be an ending I'll never see in my save :|

So.. how many endings are there? What must be done to see each of them? And is there a video to all of them somewhere?"

That's the one I saw, I'm not missing anything then. Thanks!"
