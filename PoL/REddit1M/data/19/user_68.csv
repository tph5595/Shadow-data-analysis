15824,"So I have the master sword and am trying to gear up. I have most of the towers done and am trying to get the memories take care of as well. It feels like there's nothing specific to do in non Divine Beast areas. Am I missing out on anything good gear wise by more or less driving by them? I got the second tech building and am crafting the armor in there. Is there any easier way to get more Ancient Cores? I've been killing guardians and it feels like they never drop it. I tried hitting up test of strength shrines as well and don't feel like that's that effective either. 

Edit: I guess I'm more or less looking for a checklist of things to do before fighting Ganon that isn't every quest in every area and all of the korok seeds. "
16583,But then it feels like a third or more of the zones are more or less pointless ? Other than for the fun of exploring and the shrines/seeds..
