11372,"Vague non-spoilery answer:

Selling ore (topaz, amber, opal, et al) helped me since I'd prefer to keep my cooked food/elixirs. I wouldn't necessarily sell diamonds, but you can as long as you keep a couple in your inventory.

The cliffs (and especially Goron City and its surrounding geography) have lots of ore to smash when you get there.

Spoilery addendum: [Be sure to stock up on fireproof elixir at the stable by Eldin Tower so you don't incinerate yourself when traveling to Goron City](/spoiler)."
11771,"Goron weapon can be recreated by Rohan the blacksmith. He needs a Cobble Crusher (laying around all over Goron City, really), a diamond, and five pieces of flint.

The blacksmith in Zora's Domain can also remake the trident.

Not sure about the other two - not there yet - but it stands to reason that they can be recreated."
