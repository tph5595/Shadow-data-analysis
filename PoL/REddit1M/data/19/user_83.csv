20846,"Looking for a hint as to where the champions tunic is, I'm 70 hours in and I still don't have it and it's kinda bugging me. Don't want the full answer, just a hint that guides me in the correct direction.

Also where is the Hylian shield? Spent about 2 hours combing Hyrule Castle and cannot find it."

And more info on Hylian Shield please, I spent so long in Hyrule Castle it's just annoying now."
