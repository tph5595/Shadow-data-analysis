15742,"I recommend heading up to the field to the northeast of Kakariko with a couple of bows, some arrows, and the stealth gear if you have it. You'll find a bunch of deer you can shoot which drop high quality meat. Cook 5 of the meat together and you can sell that for 210 Rupees. Since each deer drops 1-2 meat, it's quite easy to farm Rupees there, plus there's a bunch of other good stuff to harvest in the area. The only downside is that you need arrows, but you can buy them in Kakariko."
