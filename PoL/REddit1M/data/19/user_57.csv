I use the joycons in the grip and it works well for me. To me a pro controller won't be worth it until a multiplayer game where it's needed comes out (like smash)"
20750,"You're welcome! Just so you know, they are forced in some shrines. 


To me the grip and pro controller  are so similar that I don't really see an advantage to getting a pro controller. I think the grip is comfortable, but I get some people may feel differently. 

The only issue I have is the minus button is in a weird position because it's so close to the left control stick. You kinda have to move your thumb around or over the stick to hit it. I've gotten used to it more, but sometimes I accidentally hit the stick. I don't have issues with the plus button because the buttons next to it are flat so I just reach over them. "

Have you done any shrines where the trial is outside the shrine? These only have a chest and monk inside because the puzzle is outside. All the ones I've found just have one chest. "

42764,"You get it for talus, Hinox, and molduga. Each gives a [medal of honor](/spoiler). There's [40, 40, 4](/spoiler) of each monster, respectively. 


I didn't find them all, I was looking at the recipes in the guide and accidentally saw it because it's on the next page. [Here's a map](https://imgur.com/gallery/32Ukq) I posted with all locations. There's one in the fold of the page, directly southeast of ridgeland tower. It's hard to see it even in person so I couldn't get it in the picture without bending the spine. "
82572,[Heres one](https://imgur.com/gallery/32Ukq) from the official guide. 
82933,"Stalnox. The one you saw was north west of the Akkla tower. It's close to that spiral piece of land on the east coast. It's west of the path. 


[Heres a map](https://imgur.com/gallery/32Ukq) with the locations of all Sub-bosses. If you don't want to look at this, the description I gave should get you pretty close. "
83133,"I personally never had an issue, but you're not the first I've seen to mention it. 


You can turn off motion controls in the menu. That should help until this gets fixed. "
83655,You're welcome! Good luck :)
95572,"Awesome, right?! 


At this point all you can do is shoot it with your bow if it comes close enough. Watch for a little sparkle to appear after that and follow it. The sparkle will probably land in the lake. 


I don't really want to spoil anymore and I hope no one else will. If you want a little more information it: 

[it won't attack and you can't kill it. It's not an enemy, but will drop some items when shot](/spoiler) (spoiler about what happens when you shoot it)


[there are several items it can drop depending on where you hit it. You'll need the item you get for hitting it's body for a quest later](/spoiler) (spoiler about what it drops)"
113622,"It's really amazing. I was so surprised the first time too. 


I realized as I was writing that comment that it might sound like I was trying to get you to start a fight with a really powerful enemy lol.  Just wanted to be make sure you knew I was actually trying to help :)"
