74153,There was an kind of monster that I saw around death mountain when I first approached it from the east. I can't seem to find him now. He was like a giant Stalfos or something. Only remember that he is skinless. I was able to see him from a distance so I'm pretty sure he's not a regular enemy. Anybody knows its name or location?
