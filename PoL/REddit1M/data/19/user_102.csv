27581,So... this blue chicken statue thing in Hateno Village. I have no idea how to start this sidequest. Can I get a hint?
27692,Saw a cutscene of the voe meeting on here. How do I activate that? I thought I checked every corner of that area.

I only half skimmed it, because I didn't want it totally spoiled, so I'm not sure if Link was in the scene. It wasn't the cooking meeting, and it wasn't overhearing the women on the sofas to get the door code.. it was something else. The post was about the comedic dialogue."

Thanks guys."

From afar it looks like one of the final terminals in one of the divine beasts. It's big, and it's blue."
44297,Haha! And I did that quest... I must be legally stupid now. Thanks. I had forgotten it looked like that...
