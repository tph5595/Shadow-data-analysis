I know the spear can be repaired as I broke the fake one and found out the real one can also be repaired. What of the bow and scimitar/shield? I have yet to get the goron weapon however. Also are the weapons particularly durable?

I'm very stingy when it comes to weapons like this in these types of games. Usually hording a bunch of great weapons until I can blow a load on a tough enemy so this knowledge will help alot."

the one in the [gerudo/desert region is in the bottom left corner of the map behind dragon's exile. you have to get through a sand storm to get to it. it's under that large skeleton on the map.](/spoiler)"
