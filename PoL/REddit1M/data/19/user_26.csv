I can appreciate wanting to use ancient arrows on them (especially since you can still collect their loot) but I would advise you to take your time and learn how to beat them.  Even ""Major"" shrines are not super difficult once you understand the patterns and are using guardian weapons against them."

The best tip I can give you is to be patient and be prepared to block (not parry) and move away (not dodge) a lot.  The major scouts take a LOT of hits to bring down - I usually go through 3 weapons killing them.  Staying on the defensive and minimizing incoming damage (kind of like dark souls) is key for me."
17666,"I am surprised to hear that your ancient arrows are not working on scout-level guardians.  Is it possible they are being parried/blocked or that you are missing?

If you can get a major scout to phase 2 and hit him in the eye with an ancient arrow, he should take major damage!"
