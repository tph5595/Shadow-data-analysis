5635,"I'm really interested in the ""eastern passage"" used by the royal family to escape Hyrule castle. NPCs mention it and someone on this sub mentioned a house with a ton of dead guardians. If anyone has found it, what does it look like and where should I go to find it?

Other secret passages into Hyrule castle would be cool too!"
