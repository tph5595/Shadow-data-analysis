19115,"I did most of the game in the Hylian armor from Kakariko. Find the great fairies to enhance them for more defense!

I'm at 62 armor now and hunt lynels."
22748,"You can get two drops: Horn Shards and Scales.

You can use the horn shards (x2) to upgrade your Champion's Tunic to level 2."
24078,Maybe a consolation prize for not hitting the target exactly.
27003,Maybe you can get tons of mon from Kilton for them.
57658,"I never even bothered with the elixers/potions (though now I'm nearing the Death Mountain portion it seems I must).

I find them useful. There's a lot to explore in that region, plus the Gerudo Highlands are frigid and the desert gets cold at night too. In the long term, I think you're better off with the gear unless you just have tons of ingrediants."
57779,"The Wii U version is fine.

It'll lag sometimes like when in a town or maybe even combat (with a lot of monsters attacking at once) but it's not enough to stop anyone."
57912,"Do Zora or Rito first. I found the Rito dungeon the easiest so far, but both will give you a great aid for the rest of the game on completion."
62027,I think you only ever need to wear two pieces of gear to get the full effects too since no area makes you get into the third level of temperature.
63360,Uh... Farosh doesn't go to the Gerudo Highlands. That sounds like Dinraal.
64008,"Well, maybe rarely then. I have his common locations set as Lake Hylia and Lake Floria"
64760,"I went on top of an Gerudo Highlands peak to fight a lynel.

God damn Farosh flew past."
65523,"I'm headding to the one spot I saw Dinraal near the ground to get some horn shards.

I need level 4 champion's tunic!!"
