1408,"At the lab in Hateno Village and the Ancient tech lab is Akkala you have to find the blue fire furnace and bring the fire back to the land to start the quests. Along the way there are a lot of unlit lanterns along the road. Do you get anything extra for lighting all those lanterns? I tried to get as many as I could find, but it would be easy to miss one or two. 


Or are they just ""checkpoints"" where you can store the flame if you need to put your torch away?"
