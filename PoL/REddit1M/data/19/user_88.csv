22871,Bottom.
24732,"You wait for hard mode like the rest of us. Or create your own challenges like no armor run, 3 hearts, no shield, etc. Or even try things like environmental kills only"
24787,"Nope, that is in fact the entire purpose of the jewelry. There's one for each major armor set which acts as a replacement "
24912,"First go for the upgrade.  After that feel free to buy any weapon that guy sells, buy what you want or complete the set"
24952,Press the button which is a square with a circle on the inside during one.
25065,"I've been finding them everywhere. Silver/white types use them. Of course if you're trying to replace your inventory and you're low on them then exploring the castle is the way to go. Also, if you're referring to the royal GUARD set then it's only in the castle."
25119,Be the spooky luchadore you've always wanted to be
25198,Explore kakariko village. There's a quest which will lead you to the solution of what you want.
25925,Ah sorry. Look around for a let's play on YouTube and screenshot it from there
26375,"Surprisingly, they are the most difficult parts to hit. Yet for some reason they are not the best (in terms of cooking potential)"
26588,"Don't do the snow bowling if you value your sanity. Just ordinary playing will get you all the rupees you'll ever need without the torture. By the end of the game your pockets will be loaded, especially if you don't go for the amiibo tunic upgrades which take a lot of ore so that means more ore for you to sell. (I'm upgrading them and I'm still way over the amount required, lol)"
26659,"Just an FYI for people using the guide, I can't confirm other numbers but their star fragment numbers are way off. It's only ever 1 per upgrade which requires them."
26769,I try my best but there's so many people here who don't realize their answers or spoilers or it could just be me being overly picky because I hated knowing any little bit before I beat the game
27188,"There's one in roughly the NE, NW, SE, SW parts of the map, meaning that each quadrant has one. Huge areas to explore and like other commenters have said there are usually npcs which tell you where to look when you're nearby"
27289,"Really only 2 updates/packs which are the summer and winter ones., the switch t-shirt is the only reward outside of ordinary chest rewards you'll get from the bonus initial set of items."
27373,"There's tons of weapons in the game, don't worry about using a certain one. I did for a little while early in the game and found I eventually threw them away because I came across even stronger ones."
27652,Unless you plan on maxing out amiibo sets feel free to sell all the ore you want. Mark locations of the rock monsters on your map to revisit after a blood moon
28535,I think near one of the sand seal rental areas there is one
29570,"Oh, could've sworn they were both together there. Guess not"
30150,"Not a usable reward, but there is one."
33401,Might be knight shields on the ground but some enemies have the royal shields.
45159,"I'm not sure myself, but if finding that person doesn't matter much to you just use your map to find what you're looking for."
45233,The amount of Great Fairies you find = the number of times you can upgrade.
45432,I think as of yet there are no complete guides online. Give it a few days and there will be. Other than that there's the guide book but that costs money.
46620,"Keep looking, there is a place to bomb.

Extra hint if needed: [Its on the side of the mountain, right above one of those wind holes which you may have already blown up. It'll blow you right up to where the wall you need to break is. I forget, but there should be torches there too. Might be behind the wall, though.](/spoilers)"
57882,"Nope, and the cost to unlock them doesn't matter on which fairy it is, just the order they are found. Last one will always cost 10k even if it's the kakariko village one"
58127,"I use them all the time, if you're going to spend any time at all in the hebra region you should consider buying them. No downside, really. The benefit severely outweighs the cost in rupees."
58290,Quick fyi I can't confirm any value except star fragments- only one is ever required for a single upgrade stage. Not sure where they got those huge numbers from unless it was updated at some point.
59032,"I suggest the full set. If you can only afford one you could do that for now but eventually you're going to want to buy it all. Pretty much the same goes for the rest of the places you can buy clothing sets. You do get col resistance from just one alone akin to the starter doublet you get, but in the majority of places (at least in Hebra) You will need at least two pieces of cold resistant equipment."
62550,"Don't think so, and I'm pretty sure it can't go down. Haven't tried reviving a horse to see if that makes it reset though."
72085,"Lake Hylia, just use the tower nearby and camp under the archway of the bridge if its raining. Then just wait as he rises out of the water, sleep, repeat. I usually teleport back to the tower after collecting the piece because I don't want to swim out."
