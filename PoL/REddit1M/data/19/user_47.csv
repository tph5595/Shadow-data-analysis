11540,"I just started playing BOTW on the Switch. I'm using the JoyCon controller that came with it and find aiming the bow to be very difficult. When I aim it goes all over the place and doesn't seem as smooth as other systems I've played. It doesn't seem like you can adjust the sensitivity for aiming, or can you?

Does anyone know if this is normal? Or If I need to buy a Pro controller to get good right-analog aiming. 

Also, when you're fighting an enemy.. to ""lock in"" are you supposed to click the Left Trigger? Wen I do that it doesn't seem to fully lock into the enemy so I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong."

Is the JoyCon in the plastic dock considered ok for this game? Or is the pro controller worth it?"
13572,"Thanks for the reply. I will definitely be turning them off tonight when I get a chance to play.

I will also hold off a while before buying the Pro, I want to learn how to use this setup first."

1) I see 2 boxes with numbers when looking at my weapon inventory. It looks like an arrow separates the 2 numbers. I know one of them is the weapon damage.. but what's the other number for? 

2) When wondering around I see these mechanical rocks that shoot lasers. Is it best to stay away from these enemies or can you defeat them early on in the game?"
15761,"The number is when you click the item and look at the description. I think one number is the weapon strength and the other is durability or how much strength is left?

Is parrying the ability to redirect the laser back at the guardian? Kinda confused w the term.."
15918,"I see the videos online of people parrying.. but it's hard to make out what is happening. Is a parry a redirection of the laser beam? What does hitting A do?

EDIT: I see now that parrying is when link turns and deflects the laser with his shield by lifting it up."
