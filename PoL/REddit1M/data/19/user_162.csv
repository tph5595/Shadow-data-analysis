85212,"It doesn't break in the same sense that other weapons do. You use all of its swings, and it goes to 0 attack and cannot be equipped. Then it takes time (10 minutes real time) to regenerate and can be used like normal again. 

An important note here is that you must use it up entirely for it to start regenerating. I spent a while with it almost broken, waiting for it to be in good condition again, but that doesn't work. Just use it til it ""breaks."""
