47880,"Is it worth it to collect all the memories before facing Calamity Gannon?
[I've just heard there's two different endings, and I'm wondering if they're both good or significant enough to beat the final boss twice.](/spoiler)"
48338,"Do chests in the overworld ever ""respawn"" to open? And what about weapons seen strewn around in the overworld?"
49927,Read in a comment that it's basically an extra scene (ie nothing is removed or changed). Would you say that's correct?
50564,"Cool, thanks for the help! I'm like one memory off from having them all, so I'm probably going to just hunt it down and watch the ""full"" one, which sounds like it includes all of what's in the ""limited"" one. People had made it sound like an alternate ending entirely originally which had me worried I was going to miss out if I did all the memories before facing Ganon."
