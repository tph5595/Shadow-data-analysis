Last I read it suffered from some performance issues when docked, but the Switch version at very least runs at a higher resolution than the Wii U version.  I played through the Wii U version, and it's certainly good enough if that's your only option."

Infinite stamina, health, rupees, items, pretty much any combination of things that you might want.  To get them to work, you just have to go to a web site in the Wii U's browser and run the trainer on your PC."
