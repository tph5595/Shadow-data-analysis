24136,How do u solve the three apples in a tree koror puzzle? I've cut down the tree and nothing happens
24701,Man I don't know. Cut them all down? I've been trying to figure it out for days. I'd really like for someone just to tell me....
25360,For the love of god does anyone know how to do these apple tree puzzles????? I've been at it for hours and I can't figure it out
27078,Awesome. Will do
29339,Yea I am. I've been knocking out shrines left and right. I think because reason something and hearing something sound different. I just see people with vids online like 2 days after the game came out with 20 sword spots. So if they can find it that easy then I should be able to. When I've had the game over a week and only have 7 sword spots it can be frustrating 
40772,Thanks man. That had me so confused
