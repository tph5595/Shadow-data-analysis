17883,"Help!!!  I am in the Dako Tah shrine, Link uses the magnet on electric cubes to carry him and power the lifts along the  way. I went back to get a chest that I had missed, and now the cube that powers the lift up is inaccessible, the lift itself stuck halfway down. Have I lost this orb forever or is it possible to reset a shrine?"
