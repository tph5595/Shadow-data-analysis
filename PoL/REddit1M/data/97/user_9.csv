6504,"Aonuma said in an interview last year with GameInformer that Nintendo views Termina as a ""nearby land"" to Hyrule, so while you are correct, that doesn't seem to be the intention."
9357,"According to the instruction manual there aren't duplicates of the characters. The manual says that the people of Termina only look vaguely familiar to Link at first glance. They aren't exact duplicates in-world even though that's how they appear to the player. If the characters aren't duplicates, there may or may not be place duplicates."
17261,"&gt; No, it doesn't say they look ""vaguely similar at first glance.""

Yes it does... Just open up your copy of the manual:

""Termina is a mysterious place, and the people Link meets here may look vaguely familiar at first glance."""
17507,"Even if not canon, it would at least make sense though. Travel between Termina and Hyrule is accomplished by many different normal people regularly enough that the two are not functionally separate dimensions even if they technically are. There are apparently at least two passages between the two lands. They two lands worship the same goddess of time. And ALBW established that travel between true alternate dimensions takes a lot of power, and each has their own Triforce which doesn't seem to apply to Termina. Besides, the term ""parallel world"" can be interpreted either way, especially given that MM says that the Southern Swamp, Snowhead, Great Bay, and Ikana are all separate worlds from one another."
17723,"The manual says that Termina is ""a kind of parallel world that is similar to and yet different from"" Hyrule. ""Similar to and yet different from"" fits the definition of ""parallel"" and MM says that Southern Swamp, Snowhead, Great Bay, and Ikana (all nearby lands) are separate worlds. So the manual calling it a kind of parallel world doesn't rule out the possibility of it being a foreign land or an alternate dimension."
18711,"Your analogy doesn't make sense though because we're told in the instruction manual that the people of Termina only look vaguely familiar to Link. Even though they look the same to us, they look very different to the people in-universe.

&gt;Termina is not a physical location located next to Hyrule... It cannot be argued.

So I guess you disagree with Aonuma? Because he said in an interview with GameInformer just last year that Nintendo describes Termina as a ""nearby land to Hyrule"". http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2015/02/21/zelda-eiji-aonuma-interview.aspx

I also think it's weird that Nintendo would see Termina as a nearby land, but apparently this point can very much be argued.

&gt;Link dies without ever being regarded as a Hero in Hyrule and this upsets him so deeply that he becomes the Hero's shade.

Except that's not what MM or TP says. MM says that Link was known as the Hero of Time all throughout Hyrule before he left and ended up in Termina. TP says that the Hero's Shade regrets not being able to pass on his knowledge to another hero, not that he regrets not being regarded as the hero.

&gt;Termina is never mentioned, ever, in any of the games following Majoras Mask.

And neither is Holodrum, Labrynna, or Hytopia, but we know those take place in the same dimension as Hyrule."
20784,"Why would you disagree with Aonuma but agree with Hyrule Historia when it contradicts the games since Hyrule Historia comes approved from Aonuma?

As for Link in MM, you're forgetting an important line from the beginning of the game: ""A boy who, after battling evil and saving Hyrule, crept away from that land that had made him a legend...""

He was a legend in Hyrule before he ended up in Termina. You can disagree with the games if you want, but that just puts you in fanon territory."
23836,"That's one of the definitions of parallel, you are correct. But another definition of the word is ""having the same nature or tendency; similar"" which is exactly what the instruction booklet says Termina is: ""similar to and yet different from Hyrule"". Termina being ""a kind of parallel world"" doesn't prevent it from also being a foreign land in the same dimension."
23971,"So you disagree with MM's intro and think it's lying. You also think that Aonuma is telling the truth in Hyrule Historia but is lying in his GameInformer interview. And you think that parts of TP are no longer canon due to Hyrule Historia.

Clearly there's nothing I can say that would change your mind, so it's fine if you want the discussion to end here."
27749,It's what MM says at the very beginning of the game. You may need to replay MM.
27937,Presumably any timeline that MM doesn't take place in would result in a timeline where Termina is completely wiped out since there would have been no hero to protect it.
29053,"Aonuma says it's a nearby land, they worship the same goddess of time, the instruction booklet says that in-universe the doppelgangers don't actually look much like the people from Hyrule, there's multiple ways to get between the two lands, travel between the two lands is so easy that many different average characters do it, and ALBW has told us that truly alternate dimensions are difficult to travel between and have their own Triforce, neither of which fits Termina. The moon is the only reason to believe that Aonuma might have been lying and Termina should be a separate dimension. All other evidence points towards them at least existing in the same dimension (though I will admit that Termina and Hyrule being nearby one another like Aonuma says seems like a stretch)."
29583,"Skull Kid actually gets to Termina before Link does. Skull Kid was from Termina originally, and part of the reason he returned was to get revenge against the giants who he thought had exiled him and no longer wanted to be his friends. So it's very likely that Skull Kid would have returned to Termina even if Link hadn't followed him."
30529,"I do think that the Happy Mask Salesman is the one from Hyrule, but there's nothing confirming that, especially since Skull Kid seems to remember you from the events of OoT but the Happy Mask Salesman doesn't (or at least he doesn't say anything outright that confirms they've met)."
30637,"We were told that the reason Link was able to get to Lorule was because it was falling apart due to its Triforce being destroyed. However, Link and many others are able to easily travel between Hyrule and Termina, and Termina doesn't seem to be falling apart. Additionally, pictures of Hyrule's Triforce appeared in Termina (at least in the N64 version) which wouldn't make sense if Termina was part of Lorule."
86405,"Very little. I assume that the section that says Aonuma wrote it came from him, and I assume that he just gave a cursory approval of what other people wrote in the rest of the book."
86509,"Are you familiar with Novikov's Self-Consistency Principle and the theory of plastic time? If you want to talk time travel as it's portrayed in the Zelda series, you need to understand those as they're what makes MM's intro possible."
86596,"To be fair, this would be a non-issue if Ocarina of Time operates under Novikov's Self-Consistency principle as suggested by the Song of Storms."
87522,"&gt;I also disagree with Aonuma in that Termina does not feel like a nearby land to me.

I've said in my previous posts that I'm in the same boat. While I think Termina makes sense as a foreign land in the same dimension (if we explain the moon away) or as a foreign land in an alternate dimension (if we explain away almost everything else in MM and ALBW), I'm a bit skeptical that Termina should be considered ""nearby"" Hyrule.

&gt;The interpretation I get that the people ""look very similar but are different""

MM actually says that the people ""may look vaguely familiar at first glance"". It's Termina itself that is ""similar and yet different"" from Hyrule. So there's really no way we can take this as written and say that the people are exactly the same as their OoT counterparts minus personalities, names, and back stories. They must also look quite a bit different to those in-universe unless we argue that what MM is saying isn't true."
87675,"Do you mind telling me how you rank the canonicity of the games, statements from Aonuma, and Hyrule Historia, and when and why you believe each of these things overrule the others? Unfortunately it seems like there isn't a set standard for this in the Zelda community. So I'm always curious as to how others approach the series's canon."
87936,"As already mentioned there's Skull Kid, Link, Tatl, Tael, and the Happy Mask Salesman, but there's also the Deku Butler and his son who accessed the Lost Woods portal between the two, the Goron from Snowhead talks about visiting Dodongo's Cavern, and TWW talks about how Tingle (or at least knowledge of Termina Tingle) and the Postman eventually came to Hyrule."
88970,Gotcha! Thanks for the clarification.
89517,There's evidence in-game that Skull Kid arrived in Termina one month before Link did even though they exited the portal at almost the same time which seems to imply some time distortion while using the portal to travel between the two.
89780,"But what about where it contradicts the games or things that come out after it? Does Hyrule Historia make the games non-canon? What about the parts where Hyrule Historia contradicts itself or the fact that it's prefaced by a statement saying that it just contains a series of legends that the people of Hyrule currently believe to be true? While I completely agree that Hyrule Historia is canon so far as it doesn't contradict other canon, we do still have to ask ourselves how far we want to take that."
99621,"Fair enough. Before I begin though, tell me your thoughts on canonicity in the Zelda series. (I promise this is pertinent to this particular discussion.) When various information sources conflict with one another, which ones win out and why? We have in-game sources, out-of-game sources from Aonuma, out-of-game sources from people who actually write the stories and lore of the games, out-of-game sources from people associated with Zelda but not necessarily the writers, out-of-game sources associated with Nintendo but not necessarily anyone involved with Zelda, and general out-of-game sources beyond that. How do you rank these various items in terms of canonicity and why?"
100472,"So you'd never say that the games win out over Hyrule Historia or Aonuma? Even if the games were released after Hyrule Historia and disagree with it? If Hyrule Historia wins out over the games (regardless of whether you think it wins out over games that are released after it), is there any reason for us to replay the games for story or to bother using in-game evidence to theorize since it may end up that any of that can be de-canonized at a whim (even if it's by Aonuma or Hyrule Historia saying something by mistake)? How do you feel about the fact that if Hyrule Historia and Aonuma's statements are held to be higher canon the games, large portions of the games that we play through are already non-canon?

Also, what are your feelings on Hyrule Historia's intro saying that it is just meant to be taken as a collection of legends that the people of Hyrule currently believe to be true, and that readers should continue trying to discover the timeline for themselves? And how do you reconcile the parts of Hyrule Historia where the book contradicts itself?"
163097,"I think you answered me well, but I do have a few follow-up questions then. If Hyrule Historia is the databook for the series, does it bother you at all that they opened the lore section of the book by saying HH is just a collection of the legends that the people of Hyrule currently believe to be true? How should we explain the parts of HH where the book contradicts itself (even in the Japanese)? And does it not bother you that the information within HH makes 9 (or 11 if we count ALBW and TFH) of the games partially non-canon now? Is it even logical to use in-game evidence in debates and theories now since it's no longer guaranteed that the information is canon?

All of this is important for how we interpret OoT's time travel and the implications it thereby has on MM, TWW, etc."
183069,"&gt;also makes it easy to retcon if needed too.

What would they have to do to retcon it? Release a new Hyrule Historia? Release new games that disagree with Hyrule Historia?

Re: HH self-contradictions - A few off the top of my head (and note, these are from the Japanese version of the book) are HH saying that Hylia reincarnated before her ancient battle with Demise and then saying she reincarnated into Zelda thousands of years later; HH says Ganondorf poured limitless power into Zant in TP and then immediately afterward saying that Zant slowly built up his power after he had all of Ganondorf's limitless power powered into him; HH says that the goddesses were responsible for sealing away the ancestors of the Twili but then later says the four Light Spirits were responsible for sealing away the ancestors of the Twili; HH says that OoT Link appeared in the past before the Master Sword was ever pulled after Zelda sent him back in time and then later in the book it says that OoT Link himself placed the Master Sword in its pedestal when he reappeared in the past after Zelda sent him back.

Re: partially non-canon - What I mean is that HH correctly describes some of the events of some of the games, but then it says that certain things that did happen in the games didn't happen. So whenever we play those games again, that must mean that the parts HH says didn't happen are non-canon when we play through them (unless we say that the games are of a higher canon than HH). For example, HH says that Oracles Link is the same guy as ALttP/LA Link. If that's true, then Zelda's conversation with Link in the Oracles games when she meets him for the first time and talks about having never met him before must be non-canon. And all of the NPCs that tell Oracles Link that he will become a legendary hero by defeating Ganon must now be non-canon since he would already be a legendary hero for defeating Ganon if he was ALttP/LA Link. The rest of the games' stories about Link saving Labrynna and Holodrum from Ganon would still be canon, but several details within the games would have to be considered non-canon, thus making the games only partially canon. (ALttP, OoT, and/or SS probably get hit hardest with this type of thing. For most of the games HH just contradicts some important lore details, but with these three games HH contradicts major story points.)

Personally, I prefer to rank in-game information as the highest level of canon. It's the hardest medium of information to change, and it gives us the fullest story. Creator quotes and Hyrule Historia don't necessarily come from people who have played through every single detail of every single game, so they're far more prone to being mistaken about something. (Hyrule Historia even made an extremely simple mistake by claiming Darunia was the Sage of Spirit and Nabooru was the Sage of Fire. They even reversed the pictures of the Medallions. The sage titles were fixed in the English version, but the Medallions weren't.) If the creators want to change something about the games, they have to re-release the game, release a new game, or release a statement officially and intentionally stating that they mean to retcon some mistake. That would make the canon so much more concrete and infallible than it would be with out-of-game content like Hyrule Historia governing the in-game content. However, HH is a great supplement for the games, filling in gaps where the games are silent. I just think it's hurtful to the integrity of the series's lore to immediately defer to something that specifically says that it's just a collection of legends and that says readers are supposed to continue trying to discover the timeline for themselves."
2178200,"Ha, I'm not completely sure I remember what the initial question was. But re-reading these posts, I think I was going to talk about how time travel in OoT operates. There are only three types of time travel that don't automatically contradict themselves, and that's 1) Novikov's Self-Consistency Principle (i.e., time travel can't change the past; it can only fulfill events of the past), 2) Plastic Time (i.e., any action made by a time traveler in the past automatically alters everything in time after that point to some degree), or 3) Alternate Worlds Theory (i.e., it is impossible to travel back in time to the past of your own universe but it is possible to travel into the past of an alternate universe where events played out with you already in that past from the beginning).

At the end of OoT Zelda sends Link back in time with the Ocarina. That means she either has to have rewound time, completely undoing all of the events that led up to the adult timeline, or she has to essentially pluck Link out of the future era and drop him in the past era. But since TWW (and technically TP) mentions the events of the adult ending of OoT, that means Zelda can't have rewound time and undone the adult events of OoT (unless TWW and its direct sequels are just hypothetical what-if games that explore what would have happened if that timeline wasn't erased by Zelda sending Link back in time).

So assuming TWW, etc. aren't meant to be what-if games, that means Zelda had to have plucked Link from the future era and dropped him in a past era. That means either 1) Zelda transported future Link to an era when past Link still existed in the past and hadn't yet time traveled, which means past Link and future Link are now both hanging out in the same time, or 2) Zelda transported future Link to an alternate universe where Link never existed, thus trapping him in a universe where Link knows everybody but no one knows Link.

Option 2 doesn't make a lot of sense. (If Zelda could do that, why didn't she just teleport Ganondorf to a universe where he couldn't hurt anybody? And why would Zelda be so cruel as to do this to Link? How could Link possibly regain his lost childhood by robbing him of all his relationships in an alternate universe where he never previously existed?) So we have to assume Option 1 must be true.

If OoT operates under Novikov's Self-Consistency Principle (and we're shown that the Song of Storms absolutely relies on Novikov in order to exist), then that means the presence of past and future Link in the same time is something that always occurred. So after past Link had his conversation with Zelda and went off to get the other Spiritual Stones, that would mean future Link came in, talked with Zelda, and told her that Ganondorf was going to attack. After that future Link spent the ""few months"" between OoT and MM hiding out with Zelda and Impa in their hiding place. This would explain 1) why Zelda and Impa were the only ones who knew Ganondorf's attack was coming and therefore were able to escape it, 2) why there's no Hero of Time legend in Hyrule before Link falls asleep but everyone knows the legend when Link wakes up (since MM tells us that the Hero of Time's deeds became legend throughout the kingdom during these few months between OoT and MM), 3) why MM Link has new acrobatic skills (since he would have been hiding with Zelda while Impa was teaching Zelda how to become Sheik which would have allowed Link to get a little of that training too), 4) how Impa knew in advance that she was a sage even though none of the other sages knew it, 5) how Sheik knew who all the sages were and where they were hidden, and 6) how Sheik knew where adult Link was going to be at at all times.

If OoT instead operates under Plastic Time or Alternate Worlds Theory then we have to explain away so much more, including explaining how future Link and past Zelda managed to talk past Navi and past Link out of their quest of gathering the Spiritual Stones and avenging the Deku Tree's death.

That may or may not have answered your initial question. :P"
