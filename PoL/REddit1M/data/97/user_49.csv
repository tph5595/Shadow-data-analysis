33650,You have evidence of **many different** people traveling between Hyrule and Termina or are you just making stuff up?
34833,"Well fuck, wasn't expecting the spoiler for Links Awakening (guess I don't need to finish than one now.)

I'd be interested to see what he actually said in Japanese as a response to the question.  One of my biggest gripes about stories than come from a foreign country is that there is always something lost in translation,  especially when you have a very complex explanation.  There's more to it than just ""Termina is a nearby land"",  and Aonuma goes on to talk about ""they express something in a parallel world.""

The statement isn't as cut and dry as ""it's close by"".

When you combined that with the manual, and Hyrule historia is kind of like the gif that keeps circulating of a guy sitting at a desk with a stack of papers on one side and a single sheet on the other side.  He's explaining to the woman that you have years of studies about how vaccines do not cause autism, and a single internet post about how they do, and then  the woman immediate declared that that is enough evidence and that its confirmed that vaccines cause autism


TL:DR - People who say Termina is a nearby land and not a parallel world have autism."
72626,"I think the point is that you say that many different people are travelers between these parallel world and yet these 5 individuals are tied together though 1 single point of commonality, that being skull kid.  It's not like someone from Hyrule could gather up up the kids and go on a family vacation to Termina."
