128711,Well he would have sorted out Dodongo's Cavern when Zelda returned him to the Child Timeline otherwise the gorons would starve since Dodongo's cavern is their food source. This is also the same for Jabu Jabu. Princess Ruto is still trapped inside Jabu Jabu when Link returns to the point before he met Zelda.
