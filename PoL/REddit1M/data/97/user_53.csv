46306,How much of Hyrule Historian are you assuming comes straight from Aonuma?

90110,"I personally see Hyrule Historia as a giant retcon to the games.  I've heard that Miyamoto and Ayonuma are unreliable in interviews and the little I can remember seeing seems to support that.

Also when considering HH vs Aonuma vs the games I also feel like you have to look at the 3 as a whole.  If the events in the game seem to line up more with HH than Aonuma I'd probably be !ire inclined to lean towards HH in that situation."
