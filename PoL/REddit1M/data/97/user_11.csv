8186,"There just happens to be a neighboring continent with its own creation legends and guardian dieties and a separate set of identical people, many of which share the same names, personalities, and occupation? 

And you get there by falling into a tree? 

And it's so hard to get back that you age and marry and have children and die before doing so?

And in-game dialogue suggests that the world of Termina is indeed the entire world what with how it used to not be split in 4 and ""all the people"" lived together? 

**And is called a parallel world in the game's manual?**

**AND IS CALLED A PARALLEL WORLD IN HYRULE HISTORIA?**

*how is it this long since the game's release and people are still arguing about whether or not Termina is a parallel world?*
"
9393,Yes?
15136,"Anouma is a moron, and that's not even remotely canon. 

Both Anouma and Miyamoto have a nasty, nasty habit of making information up about Nintendo games on the spot. "
15187,"considering the manual calls it a parallel world

id say that yeah

it's parallel"
18114,"So if we went through some sort of crazy dimensional warp to another earth where you found all your family members and multiple earth celebrities but they had different personalities and jobs and lived in different places, and you overheard two people on the street say ""We can't be together, we're from two different worlds"", you would say ""Wow, the meaning of the world ""world"" has lots of variations, and even within this world there are other worlds, therefore this one and ours are not separate entities on separate planes of existence!""?

Probably not.

Look.

I cannot make it any simpler.

Termina is not a physical location located next to Hyrule. It is not on the same planet. It is not in the same universe. It is a parallel world. This is objective fact. It cannot be argued. 

Termina is a Parallel world.

Link remains lost when he tries to leave.

Link dies without ever being regarded as a Hero in Hyrule and this upsets him so deeply that he becomes the Hero's shade.

Termina is never mentioned, ever, in any of the games following Majoras Mask. 

It is not a fucking island situated just off the coast. "
19028,"I disagree with Anouma, yes. He and Miyamoto make shit up on the spot, and it is not to be listened to. 

&gt;MM says that Link was known as the Hero of Time all throughout Hyrule before he left and ended up in Termina.

Are you fucking serious right now? Do you have even a basic idea of what you're talking about? majoras Mask link comes from a timeline where NOBODY KNOWS WHAT HE DID, BECAUSE THE THINGS HE PREVENTED DIDN'T HAPPEN. Nobody but Zelda and the King and presumably the royal court know that he did anything! This is the *basic plot* of OOT and Majoras Mask! Link goes to the future, fixes everything, goes back to being a child just before he approached Zelda for the first time, tells her everything (that COULD happen), she gives him the ocarina of time willingly (as shown in Majoras Mask's intro) instead of dropping it on her way being kidnapped, instructs him to go far, far away so that Ganondorf can't steal the triforce, and he gets the triforce of courage on his hand because Ganondorf didn't manage to take anything. Then he sets off and **nobody knows** what he went through or did. This is the basic premise of the child link timeline! It is **only** in the adult timeline that people know who the Hero of Time was. Hence wind Waker featuring the Hero of Time heavily, and Twilight Princess *not at all*. 

Majoras Mask **never** calls Link the Hero of Time, because in Majora's Mask, he is *not* the hero of time. He's some kid who left the forest and then got lost in another forest. 

""Ever since returning to the child era, the heros shade lamented the fact that he was never remembered as a hero"". Hyrule Historia says this, outright. "
19102,"What part of what I said discounts any of this?

I even mentioned that he grew up, married, had kids, and died *in the frst comment in this chain*?"
19979,"I'm fairly certain he never returns, but that would obviously not limit his magic skeleton ghost from returning, although I guess if his kid returned he must've made it back at some point.

I don't know the whole deal with the heros shade beyond that he's Child Link's descendant (although TP does refer to him as the descendant of the ""hero of time"", but that's more a colloquialism to tell you ""HEY THIS IS OOT LINK"")"
20975,"He was not a legend in hyrule.

He was not.

Ever.

Child link, in majoras mask, was **not** a hero, **ever**, nobody **ever** regarded him as such, **Nobody** knew what he had done besides Zelda, and **nobody** knew there was ever a problem to begin with, besides the great deku tree. 

**Nobody.**

This is **fact**, and I am done with you if you refuse to understand what a fact is. The hero's shade is child link. The Hero's Shade is upset that he went through a traumatic event where he saved the world only to end up a nameless faceless child with no history or merits to speak of, unregarded as a hero. this is his backstory. This is objective. THis is not something you can argue. That is who the hero's shade is and why. Because he was a child who saved the world in a separate timeline, only to negate all of his work and go on to live a life where only he knew what he had done. And it ate at him. 

This.

Is.

Objective.

Fact."
23405,"Hero's Shade in Twilgiht Princess is the Ancestor to Link in Twilgiht Princess.

Hero's Shade is Child Timeline Link. Child Timeline Link saved Hyrule before anything even happened to it, got lost in the woods, ended up in Termina, saved Termina, left Termina to places unknown, and eventually became a decorated hero of some kind (The Heros Shade before he died), but lamenting having never been recognized or remembered as the savior of Hyrule, developed a strong connection to the living world in order to pass down his skills to a worthy descendent, which is TP Link.

In order to have a descendent, Child Link must've had at least one child. In order to be a skeleton, Child Link must've at least died."
51469,"where the hell are you getting skull kid, tatl, and tael from?

The skull kid alone is explicitly stated to be a catalyst in Termina's splitting into separate areas, a long time ago. "
63081,"

Hyrule historia also directly states the hero's shade is the ancestor to tp link. Directly. In no uncertain terms. How on earth are b you going to say ""but Hyrule historia says...!"" when it also says the thing you're questioning? "
84559,"Anouma and Miyamoto do that all the time and it drives me nuts for this very reason.

""They're the creators! What they say goes!""

I mean, to a degree? But no. No, it doesn't! They don't get to do that! This series has established canon, they can't go rogue and just make things up and suddenly they're true! "
