84485,"&gt;how is it this long since the game's release and people are still arguing about whether or not Termina is a parallel world?

The reason people think it might not be that way (and I *do not* agree) is because one time Aonuma mentioned something like Termina being a distant country, or something along those lines.  It was probably just iffy translation."

First, the Historia makes a point to say that the Hero's of Time's *blood* (not spirit) flows in TP Link.

Secondly, it *specifically* mentions the point that the Hero of Time addressed him as ""son"".  If it was just an off-handed, old man endearment, I don't think the Historia would make the point to call it out."
85153,"In the timeline that he returns to, none of the bad things that he solved even happened.  The only ones who remember him *at all* are Zelda, and though that the Royal Family, but *none* of the people he helped/saved even remember him, or that they needed saving to begin with.  So yes, he may be a ""legend"", but the word ""legend"" itself half-implies something that might be utterly fictional.  The people only *maybe* know a legend that says someone saved the world, they don't remember the actual *person* they met who saved them.

The people in Majora's Mask have no reason to remember him either.  Every time he helped somebody, time was reset and they stopped knowing anything about Link.  The moon was falling, then 4 giants came and vaporized it.  He doesn't join in on any of the celebrations or anything.  As everyone is celebrating the carnival/disappearance of the moon, Link is already on his way back to Hyrule."
85564,"In reality, it's simply because *they don't know*.  They're usually not the ones who wrote the stories and lore, and I doubt they pay as much attention to it as hardcore Zelda fans do, so what they say about it *definitely* shouldn't be taken as the end-all-be-all deciding factor."
86538,"&gt;How do you figure this?

...Cause that's how the timeline goes?  He returns to the past, as a child, before Ganondorf was able to cause any serious damage whatsoever.  He then shows them the Triforce on his hand, tells them what Ganondorf is going to do, and they (attempt to) execute him as seen in Twilight Princess.

In this timeline, the big deeds that the Hero of Time accomplished *never even happened.*  At least, not to the people living there.  This is why the Hyrule Historia talks about him like it does.  It wouldn't say those things if they had no basis.

&gt;This confirms the legend 100%

To people familiar with the Triforce and all it entails (the Royal Family).  Seeing someone with a religious symbol on their hand is a far-stretch away from personally seeing the world ruined, and then saved by someone.

&gt;The canon ending shows the people he helped, including Anju getting married.

Yes, and Link is not there.  He's already leaving for Hyrule.  The problem resolver was the moon being erased, but how would anyone have seen Link do that?  He warps inside an alternate moon dimension, and the Giants are the ones who do the visible work.

&gt;The Happy Mask Man even says so.

What does he say?"
250845,"&gt;The Deku Tree is still dead, Dodongo Cavern is still blocked and Jabu-Jabu is still freaking out. All of those things still need to be fixed even after he gets sent back.

Those things are absolutely minor in comparison to his big feats.  If he would have walked away after doing *just* those things, nobody would consider him some legendary hero.  They'd consider him some kid who helped out a couple villages.

&gt;the thing is glowing, not just a mark/tattoo

Okay, but 'glowy hand mark of possibly unknown significance' isn't anywhere near being equal to 'I saw this world taken over by evil and you're the guy who fixed it'.

&gt;This is a people who strongly believe the legends

I guess, but again believing a legend is leagues away from personally seeing that legend happen.  Even at that, I really think it'd be a stretch to assume most people are just going to automatically take that legend as a solid fact and praise Link, *and* that's assuming it's even something known outside the Royal Family.

&gt;Because everyone is outside cheering that the moon is destroyed and then the giants turn to speak to Skull Kid and Link. Hard to miss.

There is no one seen near Link/Skull Kid whatsoever, and the Giants don't say a word.  What the people of Termina see is:  4 Giants vaporizing a moon, and *maybe* Skull Kid talking about friendship to them.  The giants then sing, and walk away.  There is absolutely nothing about the scene that even implies Link had anything to do with it, other than the fact that he's standing there with 2 other people.

&gt;""...But, my, you sure have managed to make quite a number of people happy.""

And what part of that implies they know it was Link, or that they acknowledge him for it?  It only implies that his actions made them happy.   They saw four Giants vaporize the moon, and the moon being gone was a good thing.  They have no solid way of knowing it was Link who freed the Giants and summoned them.

Also, like 90% of Link's actions in Majora's Mask are attributed to the other people whose form he takes, like Mikau and Darmani.   Even if it was remembered, it'd be remembered as people other than Link doing the deeds."
278014,"&gt;It wasn't minor at all.

I said in comparison.  Helping some Gorons ≠ saving the world.

&gt;Triforce mark on hand = Sacred Realm was accessed

To anyone who might recognize it.  Even then, again, someone knowing the significance of the Triforce ≠ someone seeing you save the world.

&gt;They live in a world with Triforce symbols and Goddess statues and stuff everywhere. They take it all on faith, no doubt about it.

There are Christian churches all over the place.  That doesn't mean everyone in the world is a Christian, and being a Christian isn't equal to watching someone save the world first-hand.

&gt;Except the fact that Link saved the Great Fairy who will back him up and he was investigating Skull Kid the entire time (Astronomer, Bombers, etc.)

And then reset time.  But... *again*, being remembered by a handful of people for investigating something ≠ being known for saving the world.

&gt;he says is that the masks are filled with their happiness,

I don't see how ""The masks are filled with happiness"" is equal to ""everyone knows what you did and you'll be remembered for it"". 

&gt;Canonically, the events are all completed at the end

Even if that is true, and it's arguable, the point is that being remembered for helping a few people with their problems ≠  being remembered for saving the world.

&gt;Thats an exaggeration. 

It isn't.  There are only a handful of instances in MM where Link does anything in his human form that would be remembered on any large scale.  All of the major events are attributed to other people, and only a few, minor in comparison side-quests can be attributed to human Link.

&gt;he still is remembered by some

And no matter how you slice it, being remembered by some for a handful of good deeds ≠ saving the world.  People remember when I helped them out at some point in life, and I'm sure the same goes for you, but that's not even comparable to something like saving the world.

Denying the Hyrule Historia is just silly.  What it states is canon fact no matter how much you don't like it, and it's backed up by the in-game events no matter how many small holes you want to try and poke in it.

The in-universe fact is:  Link was not remembered for his big deeds, and he wasn't satisfied with that.  You don't like the concept?  Well, good for you, but you don't have to agree with a canon fact for it to be a canon fact."
330334,"&gt;Its just a different way than in the adult line.

Yes, a very different way... different in the way of someone who solved local problems vs someone who did all that *plus* a bunch of other shit and *then* destroyed the source of oppression and restored the world to peace.  It's 3 vs 3 + 5 + 10.  One is objectively less than the other.

&gt;It would be obvious to anyone willing to look.

A legend being obvious to *anyone willing to look*, requiring them to also *believe it* is not the same as seeing the world you *actually* live in be taken over by evil and then saved by somebody.  One was a physical event that took place in your life.  The other is a legend that you might not even know, and might not even be widespread at all.

&gt;His deeds aren't reset in the canon ending, which means that they are not forgotten.

Even if they're not, half of them are personal problems and the other half are attributed to a random Deku Scrub, Mikai and Darmani, with the biggest event being attributed to Giants.  It's another case of good guy who helps people with their person problems, vs guy who solved a world crisis.  

&gt;You keep saying ""saving the world""

Haha well what would you call it?  It's what he does, and whatever you want to call it, it's a greater deed than the stuff that he *actually* did/was witnessed doing in those people's lives/time.

&gt;Link saved all the Great Fairies in human form

Yup, that's one of the few things witnessed in human form.  Not comparable to that *plus* the grand scheme.

&gt;Link is remembered as a hero. It says so right in the actual game. There is no room for debate on this.

You say ""there is no room for debate"" because you don't want to hear other people's opinions, but in reality there are many ways to interpret ""The land that made him a legend.""  Like, a more literal interpretation:

The land, meaning the literal country of which the *legend* originates.  It implies only there is a legend based on his *unseen* deeds in Hyrule.  It does not imply this legend is widely known, nor does it imply the legend is believed by all or most, and it *definitely* cannot imply that a legend is equal to physical, witnessed events.

&gt;printing lies

Lol you act like these are factual, real life events when in reality they're a fictional story, made up on the go, worked on my many people over the course of 30 years.  Whatever the current story states is current canon, and there is a massive basis for this to be worked into the story as it is.  They decided to run with it, and this is where it ended up, regardless of whether or not you find it beneath your preference.

&gt;foot stomping is going to make the book any less wrong about this.

And no amount of foot stomping is going to make some fan right about something they have zero say in.  You can say it's wrong all you want, but your opinion on what doesn't work for you has no sway over what has now been written as canon.  Stories are allowed to be bent and tweaked (though this hardly is), and *tons* do this to some degree; especially ones as big as Zelda's.  Sorry, but it doesn't matter if you like it or not."
334234,"&gt;fanon comic

""It's not *actually* canon because I don't like it"" is basically the basis behind all your statements and massive extrapolations from quotes with malleable meaning.  I've already made my points to you pertaining to everything you said, and again, just because you don't like it doesn't make it false.  It's a fictional story, dictated by the creators, story writers and what is stated as *official canon*. Whatever point you make not only has a point against it, but is irrelevant, because whatever *you* extrapolate from a story has absolutely no basis on what was pegged as canon afterwards.  Sorry you can't see past that."
337284,"It's fine to take issue with overwriting what was previously established, but this doesn't make it non-canon, it just makes it retconned or re-explained in a tweaked way.  This is admittedly bad story telling, but by that logic, half of the Metal Gear Solid games aren't canon. Even at that though, what has been discussed here leaves room for various outcomes or interpretations, as they have unseen variables.  We described two possible outcomes, and - ignoring Hyrule Historia - either could be true with enough story to explain it.  You think one way seems logical, I think either would work fine, but Hyrule Historia claims what it does and it *is* stated to be canon, as poorly thought out as it may be.

I agree to disagree, as I don't actively support/enjoy the idea of Link being 'forgotten' and I don't think it's *necessary*, I only think it *can* work and I won't deny what the writers say is true, especially considering that if any story were expanded upon in that area, it would almost certainly follow the book's idea now.  I suppose you can choose to ignore something like that if it never comes up again and you really find it detrimental/nonsense/irrelevant, but that's not really something I do.  And yes, it's nothing personal at all and there's nothing wrong with how you look at it, I just go with what they put out."
