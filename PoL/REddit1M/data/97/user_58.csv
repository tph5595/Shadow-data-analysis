Hyrule Historia was pretty specific when it said that a lot of the Links aren't even blood related. Besides Shade calling TP Link ""son"", which could easily be a term of endearment or acknowledgement that he is Shade's literal spiritual successor, why do you think TP Link is related to Shade?"

 [On the Hero's Shade] The spirit of Link's ancestor, the Hero of Time, teaches him his secrets. Ever since returning to the Child Era, the swordsman has lamented the fact that he was not remembered as a hero.

Right, but he's upset because nobody knows who he is or what he actually did, he's just a meaningless echo. He's faded into tall tales. He wanted to be recognized for his sacrifices, and he wasn't."

Right, we see a ton of HoT's ""character"".

&gt; The Royal Family attempted to execute Ganondorf based on the word of Link when they wouldn't listen to their own princess who is a known prophet.

According to HH, what actually happens is he just takes the OoT so that Dorf can't follow up with his plans. No royal family was involved except for Zelda."
