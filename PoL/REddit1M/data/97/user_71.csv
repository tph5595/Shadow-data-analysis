* 458 upvotes is not a lot even when taking in consideration the activity and population of this sub.

* This sub is largely a shitpost sub which is why posts [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/4askr6/having_played_every_main_3d_title_apart_from_this/?ref=search_posts) will raise to the top.

* Reddit (at least subs that have more than ~10,000 subscribers) generally prefers content that appeals to the lowest common denominator, a user would prefer a quick image or meme to get a point across or facilitate discussion rather than having to read through a well thought out argument/proposal.

* This thread has had plenty of discussion, in fact I see very few low substance remarks, most of the comments here seem to be discussing the very point brought up in the post.

* If this sub isn't what you want to get out of it then simply unsubscribe from it, making condescending comments in the comment section isn't really go to do anything. "
