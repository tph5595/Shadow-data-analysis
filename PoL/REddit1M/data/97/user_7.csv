5791,"The theory is very possible to disprove. It's been confirmed that TP Link is a descendant of the Hero of Time. Since Link was a child in MM, he must have survived the events of the game, grown to adulthood, and had at least one child. There's also the fact the Hero of Time appears in TP as the Hero's Shade, an adult ghost, meaning he did not die as a child. The fact that the Hero's Shade still lingers centuries after his death dispels the whole notion that MM is about Link accepting his death and moving on."

[This image](http://s2.narvii.com/image/kkbxuluobx247p4fq57ssrtrjinn524n_hq.jpg) shows it pretty well; you can't see bones in his arms or legs at all."
