&gt;There are a lot of reused character models and assets from Ocarina of Time in Majora’s Mask. Was that just a time and money saving decision, or a stylistic choice?

&gt;&gt;Really, it was a little bit of both, whether it comes down to the decision of saving time in the schedule or it being more of a stylistic decision. I think a lot of it comes down to those character models having the ability to express something that they couldn’t in the setting of Ocarina because we had this very different image for the world where Majora’s Mask takes place. You know we described it as being a nearby land, but in feel, it’s almost like another dimension. Even though these characters have a similar appearance to the version of them that appeared in Ocarina, they express something different in a different world.

They have a way, and Aonuma especially, of conveying their thoughts in a specific way to leave as much as they can open for interpretation. Nothing they say should be taken too literally, as the way they word things can be taken in more than one way. You also have to factor in cultural differences in dialect and what's meant as a euphamism and what's meant as more of their own general opinion of something they don't really have the full grasp on. You also have to keep in mind the translators involved with this, and how transliterally they take the things that are said compared to how they're actually meant to be interpreted.

In this respect, I would say it wasn't interpreted very well. He literally says he *describes* it as a nearby land. That's not a literal definition of what the land is, that's his own interpretation. He goes on to say that it *feels* like another dimension, leaving so much up to interpretation that we get things like the ""Link is Dead"" theory for the game.

As /u/FinalMantasyX said, I also disagree with Aonuma in that Termina does not feel like a nearby land to me. The interpretation I get that the people ""look very similar but are different"" is that those people are exactly the same as their OoT counterpart, but that their personalities, names, and backstories are absolutely not the same. Like their DNA still exists in a parallel world, but the circumstances behind their birth, upbringing, and general nature have a completely different subset of events.

I feel like this is ""Theoretics of Parallel Worlds 101"" or something."
