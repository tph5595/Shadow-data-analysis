68693,"Of course they are connected. We see Link get there through the forest at the very beginning.

People from Hyrule know about Lorule and vice-versa. This doesn't mean that it's not another dimension."
68783,Hero's Shade is not HoT Link.
69051,"But that would mean that after Link returned to to the past, he went and cleaned out Dodongo Cavern, Darunia produces a child, the child grows into the 4th or 5th biggest goron in the game all in a span of a couple months. Unlikely."
80036,Where in the game does it say that he is?
80789,"&gt;It actually says so in Hyrule Historia, which still makes it canon. 

&gt;The spirit of Link's ancestor, the Hero of Time, teaches him his secrets. **Ever since returning to the Child Era, the swordsman has lamented the fact that he was not remembered as a hero. This is the reason** he passes down the proof of his courage and his secret techniques to the Link of this era, addressing him as ""son""."" (Hyrule Historia (Dark Horse Books), pg. 118)

It contradicts Majora's Mask, which states:

&gt;""In the land of Hyrule, there echoes a legend. **A legend held dearly by the Royal Family** that tells of a boy... A boy who, after battling evil and saving Hyrule, crept away from the **land that had made him a legend**... Done with the battles he once waged across time, he embarked on a journey. A secret and personal journey... A journey in search of a beloved and invaluable friend... A friend with whom he parted ways when he finally **fulfilled his heroic destiny and took his place among legends...**""

He was remembered, both by the Royal Family and when he saved Termina."
81896,"&gt;Right, but he's upset because nobody knows who he is or what he actually did, he's just a meaningless echo. He's faded into tall tales. He wanted to be recognized for his sacrifices, and he wasn't.

Not only is that totally out of character, but simply isn't true. He is a legend. The Royal Family knows it. The people of Termina know he is a hero. The Royal Family attempted to execute Ganondorf based on the word of Link when they wouldn't listen to their own princess who is a known prophet."
83754,"&gt;Right, we see a ton of HoT's ""character"".

He's lazy (per Navi), handsome (all girls wanting to get him), courageous (Deku Tree), helpful, gutsy (per Ganondorf), trustworthy (Zelda), etc. You get the picture.

&gt;According to HH, what actually happens is he just takes the OoT so that Dorf can't follow up with his plans. No royal family was involved except for Zelda.

It is a legend the Royal Family holds dear. The fact is, Link is a legend. The game makes that abundantly clear."
85685,"&gt;In the timeline that he returns to, none of the bad things that he solved even happened.

How do you figure this?

&gt; So yes, he may be a ""legend"", but the word ""legend"" itself half-implies something that might be utterly fictional.

He bears the Triforce on his hand. This confirms the legend 100% And thge only way for him to get the Triforce is to get to the Sacred Realm, which is protected by the Master Sword which only the Hero of Time can pull. Therefore, Link is the legendary Hero of Time.

&gt;The people in Majora's Mask have no reason to remember him either. Every time he helped somebody, time was reset and they stopped knowing anything about Link. The moon was falling, then 4 giants came and vaporized it. He doesn't join in on any of the celebrations or anything. As everyone is celebrating the carnival/disappearance of the moon, Link is already on his way back to Hyrule.

The canon ending shows the people he helped, including Anju getting married. They all remember good and well he was the hero. The Happy Mask Man even says so."
243756,"Yeah, but look at the time frame. Is a few months tops enough time for the goron to be born and to grow so massive? That seems unlikely."
247509,"&gt;...Cause that's how the timeline goes? He returns to the past, as a child, before Ganondorf was able to cause any serious damage whatsoever. He then shows them the Triforce on his hand, tells them what Ganondorf is going to do, and they (attempt to) execute him as seen in Twilight Princess.
In this timeline, the big deeds that the Hero of Time accomplished never even happened. At least, not to the people living there. This is why the Hyrule Historia talks about him like it does. It wouldn't say those things if they had no basis.

The Deku Tree is still dead, Dodongo Cavern is still blocked and Jabu-Jabu is still freaking out. All of those things still need to be fixed even after he gets sent back.

&gt;To people familiar with the Triforce and all it entails (the Royal Family). Seeing someone with a religious symbol on their hand is a far-stretch away from personally seeing the world ruined, and then saved by someone.

- the thing is glowing, not just a mark/tattoo

- Zelda's prophecy backs Link up (that's not saying much though)

- This is a people who strongly believe the legends

&gt;The problem resolver was the moon being erased,

That's not true, the Deku Butler's son was still transformed after the game was over.

&gt;but how would anyone have seen Link do that? He warps inside an alternate moon dimension, and the Giants are the ones who do the visible work.

Because everyone is outside cheering that the moon is destroyed and then the giants turn to speak to Skull Kid and Link. Hard to miss.

&gt;What does he say?

""...But, my, you sure have managed to make quite a number of people happy."" - Happy Mask Salesman at the end of the game"
252261,"&gt;Those things are absolutely minor in comparison to his big feats. If he would have walked away after doing just those things, nobody would consider him some legendary hero. They'd consider him some guy who helped out a couple villages.

Darunia disagrees. After saving his people from starvation, he becomes his sworn brother and then tells the story of Link's deeds just like he said he would. Also you're forgetting that they entrusted Link with the Spiritual Stones, their sacred treasures, because of what he did. It wasn't minor at all.

&gt;Okay, but 'glowy hand mark' isn't anywhere near being equal to 'I saw this world taken over by evil and you're the guy who fixed it'.

That's exactly what it means. Triforce mark on hand = Sacred Realm was accessed. Sacred Realm can only be accessed by pulling the Master Sword. Only the Hero of Time can pull the Master Sword. The Triforce is proof that the Hero of Time legend had come to pass.

&gt;I guess, but again believing a legend is leagues away from personally seeing that legend happen. Even at that, I really think it'd be a stretch to assume most people are just going to automatically take that legend as a solid fact and praise Link, and that's assuming it's even something known outside the Royal Family.

They live in a world with Triforce symbols and Goddess statues and stuff everywhere. They take it all on faith, no doubt about it.

&gt;There is absolutely nothing about the scene that even implies Link had anything to do with it, other than the fact that he's standing there with 2 other people.

Except the fact that Link saved the Great Fairy who will back him up and he was investigating Skull Kid the entire time (Astronomer, Bombers, etc.)

&gt;And what part of that implies they know it was Link, or that they acknowledge him for it? It only implies that his actions made them happy. They saw 4 Giants vaporize the moon, and the moon being gone was a good thing.

Because the very next thing he says is that the masks are filled with their happiness, which you can only get by doing those events. Canonically, the events are all completed at the end (Anju for example).

&gt;Also, lik e90% of Link's actions in Majora's Mask are attributed to other people, like Mikau and Darmani. Even if it was remembered, it'd be remembered as people other than Link doing the deeds.

Thats an exaggeration. Besides, even if that were all true, he still is remembered by some, which still invalidates the Hyrule Historia. No matter how you slice it, the HH is wrong and Link was remembered."
324521,That's what I'm trying to say.
326480,"&gt;I said in comparison. Helping some Gorons ≠ saving the world.

He is doing just that but undoing Ganondorf's evil and uniting the people against him. Its just a different way than in the adult line.

&gt;To anyone who might recognize it. Even then, again, someone knowing the significance of the Triforce ≠ someone seeing you save the world.

Even the commoners know the legend of the Triforce and Sacred Realm (Lady in the dress in Hyrule market for example). It would be obvious to anyone willing to look.

&gt;There are Christian churches all over the place. That doesn't mean everyone in the world is a Christian, and being a Christian isn't equal to watching someone save the world first-hand.

In Hyrule, everyone knows the Goddesses, including the villain. The Triforce is stated to be 'the basis of the world's providence. It is clear that in Hyrule, everyone knows the Triforce.

&gt;And then reset time. But... again, being remembered by a handful of people for investigating something ≠ being known for saving the world.

His deeds aren't reset in the canon ending, which means that they are not forgotten.

&gt;I don't see how ""The masks are filled with happiness"" is equal to ""everyone knows what you did and you'll be remembered for it"".

Because it is those people who give you those masks, and the Bombers records can back it up.

&gt;Even if that is true, and it's arguable, the point is that being remembered for helping a few people with their problems ≠ being remembered for saving the world.

You keep saying ""saving the world"", but the Historia/Hero's Shade never makes that distinction. That is totally made up and needs to be cast aside.

&gt;It isn't. There are only a handful of instances in MM where Link does anything in his human form that would be remembered on any large scale. All of the major events are attributed to other people, and only a few, minor in comparison side-quests can be attributed to human Link.

Link saved all the Great Fairies in human form, which would be the most powerful entities in Termina with the Giants (but the giants don't really have a presence like the fairies do).

&gt;And no matter how you slice it, being remembered by some for a handful of good deeds ≠ saving the world. People remember when I helped them out at some point in life, and I'm sure the same goes for you, but that's not even comparable to something like saving the world.

Link is remembered as a hero. It says so right in the actual game. There is no room for debate on this.

&gt;Denying the Hyrule Historia is just silly. What it states is canon fact no matter how much you don't like it, and it's backed up by the in-game events no matter how many small holes you want to try and poke in it.

Doing a terrible job researching the games, printing lies and demanding that they be viewed as canon is what's really silly. You say the Hyrule Historia is canon no matter what? The tell me how canon [this](http://www.zeldauniverse.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/hh_medallions.jpg) is, and how you accept it without question. Please show me how it is backed up by in-game events, because I can promise you that it's not there.

&gt;The in-universe fact is: Link was not remembered for his big deeds, and he wasn't satisfied with that. You don't like the concept? Well, good for you, but you don't have to agree with a canon fact for it to be a canon fact.

The real fact is that this claim was made up by a lazy researcher and cant be backed up with in-game evidence; in fact, the in-game evidence actually contradicts the Historia and no amount of foot stomping is going to make the book any less wrong about this."
333481,"&gt;Yes, a very different way... different in the way of someone who solved local problems vs someone who did all that plus a bunch of other shit and then destroyed the source of oppression and restored the world to peace. It's 3 vs 3 + 5 + 10. One is objectively less than the other.

You point is moot. the fact is that Link is responsible for stopping G-dorf a second time, and there are people aware of that.

&gt;A legend being obvious to anyone willing to look, requiring them to also believe it is not the same as seeing the world you actually live in be taken over by evil and then saved by somebody. One was a physical event that took place in your life. The other is a legend that you might not even know, and might not even be widespread at all.

You are inserting atheism and doubt in a world where those things are not portrayed. Almost everyone in Hyrule believes in the Triforce legend and the things tied to it, as the game states that it is the basis of their providence.

&gt;Even if they're not, half of them are personal problems and the other half are attributed to a random Deku Scrub, Mikai and Darmani, with the biggest event being attributed to Giants. It's another case of good guy who helps people with their person problems, vs guy who solved a world crisis.

Irrelevant. Link, the Hero of Time, is remembered for doing heroic deeds by more than one.

&gt;Haha well what would you call it? It's what he does, and whatever you want to call it, it's a greater deed than the stuff that he actually did/was witnessed doing in those people's lives/time.

My meaning was lost on you. I'm referring to the Hyrule Historia's quote ""lamented the fact the he was not remembered as a hero."" I'm pointing out that it says nothing about the requirements of the title, such as how many people must know or what deeds must be done.

&gt;Yup, that's one of the few things witnessed in human form. Not comparable to that plus the grand scheme.

They know what happened in the grand scheme. They know he is up against Majora, who had broken them.

&gt;You say ""there is no room for debate"" because you don't want to hear other people's opinions,

You're right; opinions aren't important, facts are all I'm interested in.

&gt;but in reality there are many ways to interpret ""The land that made him a legend."" Like, a more literal interpretation:

Even granting your interpretations, it still doesn nothing against this line:

&gt;A friend with whom he parted ways when he finally fulfilled his heroic destiny and took his place among legends...""

This is in child timeline context because it is after he returned and Navi left, and directly calls him a hero and a legend.

&gt;Lol you act like these are factual, real life events when in reality they're a fictional story, made up on the go, worked on my many people over the course of 30 years. Whatever the current story states is current canon, and there is a massive basis for this to be worked into the story as it is.

Not only is this statement massively reaching, but if you really believed 'whatever the *story* states is current canon' then you wouldn't be accepting things that are outside the actual story, such as many statements in the Historia, which by the way, Aonuma put a disclaimer on.

&gt;And no amount of foot stomping is going to make some fan right about something they have zero say in. You can say it's wrong all you want, but your opinion on what doesn't work for you has no sway over what has now been written as canon. Stories are allowed to be bent and tweaked (though this hardly is), and tons do this to some degree; especially ones as big as Zelda's. Sorry, but it doesn't matter if you like it or not.

Sorry to tell you, but the only one referring to anything canon he is me, seeing as everything I'm telling you is supported by *an actual game* and not a fanon comic. If you've got game evidence; bring it on. If not, don't waste your breath because whatever it is isn't based in fact to start with."
335987,"&gt;""It's not actually canon because I don't like it"" is basically the basis behind all your statements and massive extrapolations from quotes with malleable meaning.

I've stated already that its not canon because it contradicts the pre-established canon of the games. I've provided actual game content and quotes while being given nothing but thoughts and theories with nothing from the game to back it up.

I know you're probably tired of discussing with me and we don't seem like we will convince each other. I just want to throw out there that it's nothing personal, we just disagree."
338001,"I'm of the belief that retcons need to be in a game to be canon. It would be proof of the importance of the retcon (i.e. silver arrows to light arrows). Aonuma realizes this, hence the reason he put that disclaimer in the back of the Historia. As a side note, I don't buy into the split timeline theory either.

I dislike the idea of HoT being made out to be a shallow little whiner full of regrets. This is my hero, so it kind of offends me, irrational as that may be. That's one reason I'm so adamant about there being proof.

Also, I'm glad the wall of text is over; that was killing me at work lol."
