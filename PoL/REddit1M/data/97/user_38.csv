26411,"haha fuck, i just got into a very similar argument with my friend about evil dead 2 actually being a sequel, some dudes just dont listen common sense. "
26620,"&gt; MM says that Link was known as the Hero of Time all throughout Hyrule before he left and ended up in Termina.


Wut, thats Not even possible. I think someone needs to replay OOT
"
84980,"Yeah but it's speak directly to the player, as a narrative for what link himself knows. Time travel shit in media can be confusing but I don't get how you don't get it. 

And I actually just replayed MM"
92890,"Im not, no. you can tell me about it though. 
just so were clear though, I'm arguing that next to no one in hyrule regard the link in MM as the hero of time in OOT because the events after link meeting zelda for the first time never happened. I don't really care about the termina being a parallel world in another dimension vs. termina being a parallel  to hyrule argument. but yeah I'm open to hear your thoughts"
117068,"OK, id say that i rank everything in the exact order you wrote it out, but out of game sources from aonuma/miyamoto being tied with in game sources, the last 3 sources don't really hold much weight in terms of canonicity for me.  Hyrule historia trumps everything though.
i don't think its fair to take everything from on the spot interviews from numa/moto as canon, these dudes no doubt have thousands of tidbits of LoZ information in their headcanon that may have not made it into games/lore or whatever, they see the series as presenters, not as its presented, and it definitely shows when asked a question and giving an answer right then and there, they've both contradicted things i interviews plenty of times, its common for creators to do this, especially with a series as long an old as this.

in game sources can always have translation errors, missing content, ideas to fully realized etc.

both are generally reliable sources, but not as much as hyrule historia to me. this is a databook that they sat down, thought about all the intricacies of each game, writing everything don't for months to construct the book.

i hope i answered your question aptly, i was just out at a dinner party and am a bit drunk lol"
177143,"&gt; If Hyrule Historia is the databook for the series, does it bother you at all that they opened the lore section of the book by saying HH is just a collection of the legends that the people of Hyrule currently believe to be true?


No, not at all. I think this is mainly done for the atmosphere, also makes it easy to retcon if needed too.

&gt;How should we explain the parts of HH where the book contradicts itself (even in the Japanese)? \

you're gonna have to be more specific with me honestly, its been awhile since i read it and or even discussed zelda theory for that manner, that said, i don't think it to be the end all be all perfect file, just the closest we have.

&gt;And does it not bother you that the information within HH makes 9 (or 11 if we count ALBW and TFH) of the games partially non-canon now? 

again, if you wouldt mind specifying please, also define partial canonicity as you see it, ""partially canon"" is most definitely a hotly debated phrase 

&gt;Is it even logical to use in-game evidence in debates and theories now since it's no longer guaranteed that the information is canon?

Oh absolutely, they still have their place for sure, which is why i put in game content tied with second place in my ranking"
1758439,"shit, this got buried and i forgot about it, i see where you're coming from in a lot of your points, even though you still never answered my initial question lol"
