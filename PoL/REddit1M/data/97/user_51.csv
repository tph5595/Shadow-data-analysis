He probably stumbled across a dozen other parallel worlds between the time he left Termina and the time he turned into a Stalfos and a ghost. And did he ever find Navi?"

&gt; You have evidence of **many different** people traveling between Hyrule and Termina or...

Skull Kid is **from** Termina, and Tatl and Tael are probably **from** Termina as well. But it's also clear that all three **traveled** between Termina and Hyrule.

We see all three in the Lost Woods, Hyrule's Lost Woods, at the start of the game before they return to Termina. Skull Kid is implied to be the same Skull Kid you teach Saria's Song in *Ocarina of Time*. So he probably originated in Termina, but he moves back and forth.

You could've asked a little more nicely."
