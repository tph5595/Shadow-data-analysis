14509,"If Termina is in a ""parallel world"" as the HH suggests, then it stands to reason that the portal works both ways... the people who travel through it may not even be aware that they are travelling to a parallel world, and just assume it is a neighboring country."
32381,"Depends if you believe what Nintendo wrote in the Hyrule Historia I suppose... I don't see why a magic portal in the mystical Lost Woods has to be difficult to traverse though.  The woods themselves are difficult to traverse, but to go through a portal all you have to do is walk (or fall) into it.

To be perfectly honest, I think it was just their excuse as to why the world creation lore in MM was different, and why they re-used a lot of the same character models from OoT when they weren't really the same characters... A ""parallel world"" is probably just the most convenient explanation they could come up with.

Edit: grammar"
341902,"Haha good point... I suppose when people started thinking about Link getting ""lost in the woods"" it eventually evolved into ""the lost woods"" but it could be any forest, really. "
