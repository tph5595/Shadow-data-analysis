9513,"But a Stalfos transformation only happens in the Lost Woods.

He could have been in there after the war..."
9833,"Indeed. The Heroes Shade is (most likely) a Stalfos and as it is said in OoT, adults turn into a Stalfos if they enter the lost woods. Key word. Adults. 

Since the beginning of Majora's Mask is takes place in the Lost Woods and therefore a valid counter would be that that was when Link transformed. But only adults transform into a Stalfos. Children (which Link is mind you) turn into Stalkids... Or Skull kids (yes the same one as in MM) I'm not sure the names... The ones that had the black face controversy!"
