248732,"Try exiting and closing the game (Or shutting down the switch) then restart it,  that fixed it for me.
Or at least it hasn't happened in the last few days since I restarted  (apparently there's a few problems with times if the game has been just put into sleep mode for too long and not actually closed)"
