115402,"How are exactly the horse colors randomized? Basically my question is whether I'll be able to get a completely black horse just by wandering and taming or if such a horse is part of a quest. Trying to find information about horses and their colors spoiled me on several special unique  horses (some of which I had luckily found already) and that really annoyed me, so I just want to know if I'm wasting my time trying to get a black horse by wandering around stables. The most ""completely black"" I've got still has a white line in its forehead, is this the blackest horse you can get?"
