85519,"Any tips for the escort quest with Yokobo (sp?)? When I got caught the first time, I gunned it and he was stuck between two ""sensors"" unable to move. I found some doors lying around but couldn't position them over him for cover. Please help, this is really the only time I've been frustrated with BotW so far."
