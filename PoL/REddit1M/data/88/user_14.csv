52885,How can I learn how to kill a lynel efficiently? I watched a couple videos on how to do perfect dodges and I rage quit botw the other day bc I couldn’t get one after like 4 reloads. I killed it every time but not one perfect dodge. It seems like lynels are the only issue I have with combat as any type of guardian I can shield parry 95% of the time and all the bosses I’ve killed have been cake. 
378714,is it just me or is the ancient bow overpowered
