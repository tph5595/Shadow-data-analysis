There's also a dude you can sell horses to. Reply if you want his location spoiled."
106161,"I have trouble getting perfect dodges and parries, so my go-to method:

1. Dodge his regular attacks (usually to the side). I don't usually get perfects, I'm just trying to avoid getting smashed.

2. On his fireballs, he usually ignites some grass. I whip out the glider and use the fire to fly up in the air, then bullet-time shoot him in the face with an arrow. This stuns him.

3. Land, run up to him, hop on, and hit him a bunch.

Rinse and repeat."
