268170,"What factors affect bow damage? I’ve messed around for ages, using the Champion’s tunic for numerical data. Sometimes a 12 damage bow will deal 24 damage to a blue bokoblin (headshot). Other times it will kill in a single shot, normally against their lookouts. I can’t seem to understand why it differs. "

Would have been nice if they made the extra damage explicitly stated. "
