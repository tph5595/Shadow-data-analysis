9455,"So I've finished the game and spent a lot of time exploring, I've gotten about 60 shrines and I'm interested in going for all 120, problem is I've explored 90% of the map and I know I can easily find another 20 or 30 if I try really hard. I guess what I'm asking is, is there any way of finding the shrines more easily, without relying on the sensor or an online guide? "
