585133,"First time player of Zelda or really any RPG. Started about a week ago playing moderately an hour or two a day. But I'm so clueless I just keep walking around and have no idea where to go. I know I'm searching for Shrines. I can mark them on the map and such but I can't seem to find a town to get any decent gear.

Any advice for a first timer RPG Zelda excited enthusiast?"
