14515,"May I ask what the ""banana inventory thing"" is about?  

As far as my brief experience has gone so far--I defeated Kohga and the clan pops up everywhere, archers and blademasters.  They are more frequent now than before I beat the clan.  

Edit: spelling"
14865,"Just got the game for Christmas and I was intending to go for the whole beating-it-with-only-3-hearts schtick, is this possible with this game?  I ask because I heard a rumor you needed more hearts in order to get the Master Sword.  "
15854,Hmm interesting--I guess in a way that's true for me but I would pin it more on the fact that the clan is pissed Kohga was defeated so they're just on to me.  Therefore more frequent appearances.  I think it's crazy how much more often they show up after you clear the hideout though.
84650,Thanks for the clarification!
84888,I didn't rage quit but I was getting very frustrated as to why parrying wasn't working against the Lynels too.  Glad someone else answered your question.
