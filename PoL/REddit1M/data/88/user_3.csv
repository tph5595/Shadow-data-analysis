12166,"What factors affect Yiga clan spawn (after I've beaten Kohga)? I made a thread asking about the banana in inventory thing, and only one person actually answered that question by saying they don't think it's a thing because they have had tons of bananas and only got 2 or 3 random encounters with them after they've beaten Kohga. While his thing disproves the banana thing, how the hell can someone only have 2 or 3 random encounters with the yiga?

Also, is there anything confirmed with the banana theory, or is it just a myth? Only that one guy actually had input for that specific question

"
14850,Some have claimed that their spawn rate is proportional to the amount of bananas in your inventory
116718,"So I went to Riola Springs to see Farosh appear, and when he finally I appeared, I was looking away, so I decided to go load back a few minutes and watch it again, but then he came about an hour later than he was supposed to. I was confused, so I went back to an autosave that took place a few minutes before he spawned the second time, and his spawning was put off another hour further. Is this a bug?

 I've had farosh come from the riola spring as late as 3am and as early as 12am

Maybe I just don't quite understand how dragon spawns are supposed to work?


Edit: I just tried loading back and staying in the same place, which was quite away from the riola spring, and it still was very inconsistent when he would appear

127415,So [this schedule](https://zelda.gamepedia.com/Farosh) is bullshit?
