Long post, there's a part about halfway that explains how Yiga clan activity works. Tl;dr: it's mostly about how far you're into the Vah Naboris main quest.

Pretty sure the banana in inventory thing is just a myth."

You should learn to parry the following attacks:

- 1. running wide swing
- 2. no-weapon charge
- 3. running overhead swing (Crusher only)
- 4. running fast swing (Sword only, timing is identical to 3)
- 5. jump attack (mostly Spear, rarely Sword)

You don't *need* to parry:

- the big AOE attack. It is super slow and telegraphed so you can just headshot directly. Moreover, they only do it at the beginning of the fight and after their HPs go below 50%, sometimes when they're almost dead; you should almost always know when it's coming, so that you can better position yourself to take the shot.

- triple fireball: telegraphed again, sometimes they jump back (facing you) when they're about to do it if you're too close. Try to headshot before the first fireball comes out. If you miss, start running sideways (NOT strafing, don't hold RL), and headshot after the third.

The reason why you don't need to learn the timing for other attacks (the close range ones) is because they're triggered by you being close to them, and you'll never be since after every dismount they run away a little. However pay attention to the environment, if they get stuck into a tree or something they *might* do them.

If you don't want to bother: try to get at least one Savage Lynel Bow by killing a Lynel with whatever non-efficient method. ie three spin2win loops with a decent greatsword + Urbosa's Fury are usually enough. Once you get the bow, you can just point blank-headshot them to death: first shot stuns them, add another 2 or 3 while they're kneeling, **wait** for them to shake their heads, headshot again to re-stun them. Rinse &amp; repeat. This method is still efficient / sustainable, since with a single bow you should be able to kill at least 3 Lynels, so you get 3 bows at the price of 1."
