121056,"&gt; Use the slate scope to mark where one falls then get there before day comes. They vanish at sunrise.

Further to this, you CAN warp to the shrine/tower nearest your marker, and the Star Fragment will still be there. At one point it was said that if you set a campfire and wait until the next night, skipping everything from Sunrise to 9 PM, you can get as many nights out of that one Star Fragment as you need; I've never tested this myself."
121189,"In addition to what /u/Chem_chem said, most people agree that the three phases of the trial are in *decreasing* order of difficulty. The first phase is the hardest (especially one particular room of it), and the last phase is the easiest (especially if you make sure to find all the treasure chests in each room with your Sheikah Sensor)."

121575,"I've never seen an accurate, exhaustive description of dragon spawning behavior, but it's definitely *not* just synchronized to the game clock; your proximity to their spawn location matters, and maybe other factors. Farosh in particular has at least two completely different spawn locations, and his route is so lengthy that the whole thing might take more than 24 hours (though I'm not sure of that).

I myself have witnessed strange behavior when their spawn point was loaded by a Travel Medallion teleport rather than being walked/swum up to. It's complicated. But for all three dragons, once you have them spawning consistently, the most reliable farming spots should be camped at until morning (5 AM)."
121607,Yes. For some of them you have to beat Ganon first.
123012,Yes.
144639,"Definitely. You farm Farosh at 5 AM at Riola Spring, but if you’re at Lake Hylia then, it will sometimes/always spawn there as well."
283478,It’s actually not good to do that until you have all 120 shrines. There are hundreds upon hundreds of chests and you will be constantly distracted by them if you haven’t done everything else yet.

The marker then lets you extend a line from your previous location through the marker and out to where you can look for the actual item. In some situations it is surprisingly easy to lose that light beam."
