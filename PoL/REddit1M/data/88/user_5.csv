This is based on just my game and watching my son.  He always runs away from the blademasters, and it seems like they are always stocking him.  I kill them, and they don't seem to come around all that often."

One tip about talking to characters to find quests, as you approach characters and you see the little thought/narrative bubble pop up next to them, if there is a red dot, that person has a quest for you."
