23722,"Man, I just did a certain quest in Hateno Village and it sure would have been nice to get it all done at once instead of with 14 steps. Just wanted to say that somewhere. No questions today haha"
47650,Well I guess it’s not a spoiler to say it was the one where you get the house
190130,"What is the consensus feeling on when to play the dlc? I’m at the point in the game where I’m ready to take on Ganon and I’m just doing side quests, shrines and exploring. So is the dlc best played after I beat the game or before?"
391196,Do I have to use a korok leaf to use a boat or is there a way to get them moving without one?
394403,Thanks. I’ll have to try that. I have too many cool weapons right now and not enough space to always carry a leaf. 
437335,"Without spoiling it, is there a shield and a bow in the game that don’t break like the Master Sword?"
440251,That’s good enough haha. Thanks for the help. 
561220,Good idea. Hadn’t thought about that
