That being said, I *almost* want to say yes for shield. I'm not sure if I should say more than that because I don't know what your threshold for spoilers is."

I actually kinda envy anyone who is getting into the game now for the first time with the DLC included. Most of us so far had to wait months for it to come out after we'd already finished the game haha"
