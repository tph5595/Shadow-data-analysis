12361,I ran out of weapons to use and left Vah Ruta before beating the final boss. Can I get back in without it sending the shockwave that bounces me back?

Edit: I figured it out. For anyone else with this problem, get close to Vah Ruta, open your map and zoom in to where the Divine beast is and you should have the option to teleport there. Only works when your close."
