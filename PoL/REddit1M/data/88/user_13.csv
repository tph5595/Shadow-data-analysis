52575,"There are 3 (Dinral, Farrosh, Nayru) dragons that drop four items. Scales, Fangs, Horns and Claws depending on where you hit them. These ""parts"" are super valuable and are used for top teir armor upgrades, and they nearly tripple the effect time of any potion made with them. Each dragon roams certain parts of the map at certain times, and you can farm parts indefinitely but are limited to one item per dragon every 24 hours."

111407,"Yes, theres 3 clear and different layers.

First has 10 rooms, Second has 15, Last has 20.


Every five floors change setting/environmental hazards and will have a reprieve space.

The End prize increases the durability and base strength of the master sword, beating all 3 permanently keeps it at 60.

These combat puzzles are equal parts stealth and survival, strait combat doesn't really help unless you've collected enough to hold your own (its like that island challange where you start naked and unarmed).

I had fun the first time, but couldn't be bothered to do it on master mode."

Its best to look at every game as its own package and be at peace with it. Yes, there are similarities between games, but they are all more like nods to series fans that recognise them rather than deliberate world building."
