27349,True Fans knew it from the Beginning. It was just too obvious that this Character is Link.

That's why i made this ^^ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiSPRCFG0u8"

42366,"I don't know how you look, but this is a man and 100% not a woman."
42954,"I think my heart would be break if the new Zelda would have motion control. That was horrible and the only reason why i never played SS till the end.
Link was always a leftie, like he always wear a green tunica, has blue eyes and use a sword to fight.
It's part of his whole character and if you change such a thing then you can change anything and make a new game.
If you can live with that - fine. But i need a VERY good reason to make a left-handed hero right-handed. Anyway i won't accept it.
And if the reason is motion control, then it doesn't matter anymore. Cause i won't play it. I hate motion control."

I think he has a Penis if it is that, what you call a ""specifically manly feature"".
But i will try more. His face looks not female. He has muscles, no breasts, big hands, big eyebrows, maybe big feet, strong neck and... i think that's enough. And now point out what you think make him look like a woman. And don't say Hair, because this is a fantasy world where such hair is gender neutral."

I'm not saying that i am such an expert, but somebody who played most of the Zelda games need to know how link look like, even in a new release. ""much to learn you still have."""
47347,"In Germany we write many words in capitals. I'm just not used to the english spelling. My brain tells me constantly that this word would be capitalized in Germany, but since my grammar is not that good anyway, I write sometimes wrong words big and other small. I hope you understand what i mean - i am not good at speaking or writing in english. But i understand the most."
