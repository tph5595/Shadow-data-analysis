32648,"This has been my prevailing theory since he first made those comments, and has been cemented by his other responses to the notion that this character is a girl.

Customizable characters in a Zelda game makes sense (though I personally don't care, nor do I advocate for the feature's inclusion).

We've always been able to name Link, and he's always been meant as an extension of the player. He still doesn't have a voice, and that's because his voice is yours. Other games like that almost always have character customization (mostly western RPGs come to mind).

Aonuma's comments have slyly introduced the notion that the player character is not necessarily Link - because it's someone that can change.

Or, there's just going to be some loot/gear system."

On people thinking Link is a girl:

&gt;That might be something that consciously we kind of did, but not to say anything specific – I am not saying anything specific – but, I am hoping people continue to comment, and I will continue to follow the fan comments and reactions to the trailer."

Also I'm not saying Link could be a girl/is a girl, just that customizable characters are possible. Aonuma hasn't said anything to rule that out, and in fact some of his statements imply the possibility."

Character customization. It's possible."
