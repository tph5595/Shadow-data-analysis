27698,or that you didn't need it's powers anywhere in the game because of a lack of difficulty :P
28617,"well, he never explicitly said it wasn't a girl in the trailer ;P

**edit**
I don't know why I got downvoted on this, as I'm not lying or trying to troll. In the interview he doesn't actually confirm that the Link shown was in fact not female, just that it was Link. This is as far as I know at least, if you have another source please show me."
28829,"Rupees are easy to get, hero mode in a game that lacks it isn't :c
Could be very useful for an easy mode 3 heart run though...

But I def have to agree, STOP DEVOURING MY RUPEES!!!
(also, could someone please tell me how to make text bold? or is it just html code)"
29146,"very useful, you're getting an **upvote** :D"
31705,"then please show me the exact source where you read that because he doesn't say that at all, he doesn't say ""it never was a girl"" afaik.

I've read the interview multiple times and I'm sure I've never seen that line pop up in it. Also, your comparison is flawed. I never said it **must** be a girl, I just said that the possibility is still there, that's a **fact** until being explicitly stated otherwise.

Please stop being butthurt over possibilities and speculation, or leave the internet."
32968,"you could have saved alot of time by qouting that right from the start you know... it might be a big surprise to you maybe but people can misread things, yes that's right m-i-s-r-e-a-d.

you weren't helping anyone out by just being butthurt over my post instead of quoting a part of the article that I might have missed.

sorry if this post made me look like a dick, but people like you really annoythe hell out of me, all I was trying to do was keep things open for discussion and instead of leaving a nice reply telling me how it is you just shoot me down...

Luckily there are **some** nice people here like daboyzuk who have the decency to be nice to people."
52684,"Clearly you haven't read what I said properly, I misread the article and missed the part where Aonuma said ""him"". I never said it was his fault for me misreading something in an article, it was his attitude in his post that made me reply like I did.

/u/daboyzuk quoted the article in a nice way however, while /u/mastersword130 just gave me shit which I like most sane people didn't enjoy. I didn't go off on him because he proved me wrong, it was because of his attitude towards me.

And then there's you, stoking a fire under a finished argument. What happened happened and it was all a misunderstanding, please don't pretend like I'm the bad guy here. We were both equally in the wrong here."
