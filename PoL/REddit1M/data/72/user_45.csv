45385,"I think you handled this much worse than /u/mastersword130. You were a lot more rude than he was at each turn.

First off, your initial claim. ""well, he never explicitly said it wasn't a girl in the trailer ;P"" Yes, he did, by using the ""him"" pronoun. Even if that wasn't the case, /u/mastersword130's comment is still relevant. Even if Aonuma was ambiguous about his gender (which he wasn't), that doesn't automatically mean there's a chance at him being female. I don't remember Aonuma ever having to come forward before and be like ""okay everybody, let's not forget that Link is a boy!"" It should be obvious. He even says that himself, and admits that it's why he perpetuated the joke in the first place. As Aonuma said, ""You know, you have to show Link when you create a trailer for a Zelda announcement."" He's pointing out that it's laughable for people to say the main person featured in a Zelda reveal is somebody other than Link.

Let's go to /u/mastersword130's first comment, the one you attacked him for.

&gt;He also said it never was a girl. I never said I wasn't will smith so that must mean I'm will smith.

Essentially, he's saying the same thing you are. You're saying Aonuma never specified Link's gender, therefore he could be a girl. /u/mastersword130 is saying that because the gender wasn't specified, that also *doesn't* automatically make him female. You went off on him for that comment, even though it was basically the same thing you said. Here's a quote from you when you replied to him:

&gt;Please stop being butthurt over possibilities and speculation, or leave the internet.

How is he being butthurt? Aonuma ***DID*** explicitly call Link a him, that means that /u/mastersword130 is correct in saying ""he also said it never was a girl."" You called him out over that, so he provided the exact quote you asked for. Then, once he provides the quote and proves you wrong, you continue giving him shit, saying it's not your fault for misreading things. Even though you claimed earlier that you ""read the interview multiple times."" You then accused him of being butthurt, again, and blamed him for not originally quoting the article. As /u/mastersword130 pointed out, I don't think he's butthurt at all. You came in, saying Link might still be a girl, and he proved you wrong. Then you go off on him, saying he's mean and rude and that he doesn't have the decency to be nice to people. But you're the one doing all the name calling... how is he indecent?"
