24913,All those people calling me sexist for pointing it he wasn't a she and the lack of boobs was a big hint...suck it! 
25028,They won't do that with established iconic characters. If anything they'll just make a spin off series like hyrule warrior or the like. 
25218,"Finally, now we can stop talking about gender bender link and talk about thing that's really matter. One being is why the fuck is he right handed?! 

Edit: love how I'm being downvoted "
25279,"You need to let this go, Link is a male. Everything in that teaser screamed young teenage male. "
27347,"AA breasts will still have a damn bump, especially when he drew his bow and his shirt clung to his chest. A little bump indicating any sort of chesticles would have made it clear. There is nothing. "
30456,"Personally I hope not, one of the reasons why I couldn't get into SS."
31011,He also said it never was a girl. I never said I wasn't will smith so that must mean I'm will smith. 
31098,The hero of time was only in two games. Every link though used the green tunic 
31942,"You're the one who's being butthurt when they threw out the idea of a girl link. 

&gt;""It seems like it has kind of taken off where people are saying 'oh it's a female character' and it just kind of grew. But my intent in saying that was humour. You know, you have to show Link when you create a trailer for a Zelda announcement.""

""But my intent in saying that was humor."" Right there, it was a joke when he was asked about a female Link. He made a joke about ""not being Link"" just to stroke the flames, this is very much connected to the girl part because people get speculating it wasn't link because he looked effeminate.

It's just a girly looking male Link. 

&gt;""I don't want to define him so much that it becomes limiting to the players. I want players to focus on other parts of the trailer and not specifically on the character because the character Link represents, again, the player.""

""I don't want to define **HIM**."" Another one right there, he already stated it's a guy but not to think too much into it because Link still represents the player. "
32460,"Hell, even in the ooT 3DS title he looked very girly as an adult also. "
32724,"Actually there is, his spirit or essence for reincarnation will be the same being. Left handed, hylian and all. 

The only reason SS had a right handed link because majority of people are right handed. Link has always been left handed and lore wise only SS is right handed. 

If he's right handed in the teaser then that might mean something about motion controls which I hope won't be in the game. Hopefully it's just him being right eye dominant but he's still wields his sword with his left. "
33042,"Have no idea why you're downvoting me but whatever. SS is not the first Link at all, he's a reincarnation of the first Link. The first Link we saw in the manga that's before SS and even though it might not be canon (most likely is) he was Left handed. 

Zelda also isn't Hylia in SS so another reason why that Link isn't the first Link also. "
33291,Sorry but I'm a very blunt person. Also a very lazy person who uses alien blue most of the time so it's kinda hard to actually quote crap.
33877,"&gt;
Aonuma's comments have slyly introduced the notion that the player character is not necessarily Link

right there in the article he said he was joking when he said that. It's still Link. 

&gt;""Actually that comment I made jokingly,"" he said. ""It's not that I said that it wasn't Link. It's that I never said that it was Link. It's not really the same thing, but I can understand how it could be taken that way."
34692,"To stir shit up like he usually does. 

&gt;""I don't want to define **him** so much that it becomes limiting to the players. I want players to focus on other parts of the trailer and not specifically on the character because the character Link represents, again, the player.""

"
35709,The only reason he was right handed for SS is because of motion control. Every other link without motion control was left handed like Miyamoto. It would be very strange to make him right handed without motion control just because. 
35828,"It's not, Link was always left handed. It's part of his characterization, it's not just because but for the reason for that being who he is.  "
36137,"http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Link

Look at all those Links. All of them are left handed expect for SS. It very much matters to me, it's part of his characterization. "
37321,"Exactly, why change an already established character just to have a female lead? It would make more sense to make a spin off game with an already established character that's a women, look at Impa from SS and Hyrule Warriors. She's a badass, I would love to play a game revolving around her story and finally understanding more about her people. "
37416,I've been called a sexist and a racist for saying Link was always a white hylian male who's left handed. People....what a bunch of bastards. 
37661,"Motion control, I fucking hated every minute of it. That's what a right handed Link implies, motion control because that's when the only time he's been right handed and the mirrored master quest for OoT."
37783,"Yeah, that's where a spin off comes into play. It's like how we have many mario games then we have spin offs with Lugi, Peach, Yoshi, Wario etc etc. It's a good way to explore the universe of Zelda if they're tired with the Link, Zelda and main bad guy formula.  
"
38151,"&gt;So yeah, no actual bearing on him as a character or the story.

For you maybe, for plenty of others like myself it's very important. The only time I like motion control is for sport games or Mario kart or light gun games. Other than that I just despise motion control combat, I feel silly 99% of the time when using it. "
38551,The difference is being who Link was modeled after and to all us left handed players having a Hero that is left handed. 
41288,Yeah because they didn't call themselves hylians until they founded hyrule and choose a name to honor Hylia. It's pretty easy to assume that the humans were hylians before they changed the name to honor her. 
42923,"He's shown as a lazy person who gets thrown into heroics against his will. It's a subtle thing but that's his personality, he isn't soulless. "
46342,"I wouldn't say far into the future, just there is a lot of magitek that was lost in the ages. "
46669,"Some people still won't let go of the idea. I was hoping this would put it to rest so we can talk about more than just his gender but nope, some still clinging on the hope of a female link. "
74730,That is nowhere close to the first link. All links before OoT was left handed. That looks like a link off master quest where the world was mirrored 
75076,"I stated this also but then people throw ""the reincarnation doesn't specially say he can't be a girl"" which kinda ruins the whole ""you will be reborn as yourselves for all enterinty"" bit. 

Either or in the real world they won't change an iconic characters gender. "
75206,"GC version is the official version for TP. Officially he was right handed in one game, SS."
