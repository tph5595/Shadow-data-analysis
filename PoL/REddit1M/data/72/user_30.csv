36409,"Is a female Link who is the exact same character as Link proving gender equality?  ...Or did they slap some boobies onto a male character and just call it equal?

Link, in this age, is an established character.  Sure he's reincarnated most times, but he's pretty much the same person.  Turning him female just to say we had a female main character seems like pandering of the highest order, especially when there are a lot of female characters we could have **instead** of Link as leads."

36703,Thank you so much Aonuma.  If every day was going to be yesterday in the fandom I was going to quit life.

Wouldn't it be better to actually make the main character a different person who is a girl?

In a way, by turning Link, an established male character, into a girl, aren't you saying that the other girls in the series aren't good enough to be playable?  The only way to get a girl as a playable character in a Zelda game is if we genderbend the male lead?"
