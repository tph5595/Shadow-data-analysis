38628,"&gt; I thought it looked a lot like oracle of ages/seasons Link in the artwork.

That's exactly what I thought, but apparently I was wrong and missing many feminine aspects of *his* design.

Take *that* people who called me out!"
38756,I maintain that this link looks no more feminine than [the Oracle Linke](http://zeldawiki.org/images/3/36/OoA_Link.png).

For what it's worth my favourite games are SS, TP and OoA, so you're in good company. I want another adventure in Holodrum/Labrynna :(."
