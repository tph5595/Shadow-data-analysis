30054,Me too. I thought I was going to have to endure a year of speculation before someone had to spell it out to everyone.
30214,"Aonuma played the fan base for a fool. So many people were so dead set on it being Zelda or it being a female protagonist and now here they are, shot down immediately. Not to scoff at those people, but I can't help but find it funny. Looks like it's just a 13-15 year old Link. I thought it looked a lot like oracle of ages/seasons Link in the artwork."
30721,"If he doesn't wear the tunic he's not the Hero of Time. It's kind of part of the whole reincarnation thing to get the Hero's Garb, so it would kind of break a tradition that, although isn't rationally necessary, would kind of ruin some of the nostalgia of the franchise, especially when a majority of the fan base isn't calling for a change like that. It's definitely just his starting outfit.

edit: to be clear, when I say he's not hero of time, I mean he's not part of the lineage of the Hero of Time/Winds/Sky/etc."
33231,"Yeah I was surprised everyone was flipping about the possibility of a female character. And then Aonuma said ""who said it was Link"" and made the shitstorm even worse. I thought it was for sure Link, but if it wasn't going to be link, it would've been a younger brother or something. No way it was ever going to be Zelda or any other girl."
33676,"I think it's a 13-15 year old boy designed by Japanese developers. Not sure if they are looking that deep into it, seeing as they want to keep the series recognizable but want to make the game more fun by altering the mechanics, not by altering small details of a character. All of this feminine stuff is just an extreme reaction to a Link that we aren't used to seeing, because we are so accustomed to an extremely cartoony young boy or a masculine young adult link but not a 13-15 year old teen Link that might not have made it all the way through puberty."
36159,"Eh, Final Fantasy characters definitely put Link to shame in the femininity department, but he definitely has some feminine features, just like every other Japanese character. This is definitely the most feminine looking Link, but not nearly enough to be a girl. And this is coming from a guy whose been known to date tomboys.

Edit: I'd like to add that since we are westerners, we don't really know what the Japanese see as masculine. Japanese males definitely don't have many physical similarities to European/American males. There are many differences between Japanese females and Japanese males that seem like nuances to us, but stick out like a sore thumb to Japanese people."

41157,"It's because in people's minds there are only two Zeldas: OoT and WW. Everyone forgot all the other ones existed. Occasionally we see a few discussions mentioning LttP, MM, SS, or TP, but all Zelda conversations are definitely dominated by OoT and WW, which I find incredibly disappointing. God forbid anyone mention the original LoZ or LoZ II. My top zelda games are SS, MM, LttP, and OoS, so you can see why I'm butthurt. :("
54690,"The game itself does get pushed behind OoT though. There is a huge outcry for a remake, so it doesn't get buried quite as much as some of the others. It's the 2D Zeldas that lack attention the most, which i find funny considering that is how Zelda started."
57922,"Yeah that's true, but that doesn't mean the 2D Zeldas aren't worthy of praise. I'd rather play LttP again before replaying OoT."
292483,"I definitely agree. And the effeminate look is not only just an art style, but it's also just physical characteristics of Japanese men. To western men, Japanese men look scrawnier and more ""effeminate"" but it's actually just the genetic traits Japanese have."
