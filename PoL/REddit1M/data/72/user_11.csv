Given the quotes presented, I think the author is taking a bit too much liberty in his interpretation of what Aonuma was trying to say. He doesn't seem to clearly address Link's gender in the quotes, only whether or not he was in the trailer and the rumors surrounding that. I believe the only thing that can easily be viewed as confirming Link's gender is his one use of the word ""him,"" which I wouldn't cling to given the fact that this is either a Japanese translation or Aonuma's (not so good) English, and the fact that he's been using male terms to refer to Link for years and could have easily just said it out of habit."

24913,"Link's new appearance suggests that Link is a girl. I don't have some sort of motive for Link being a girl in this game; she just simply looked like a girl the first time I saw the trailer and she still does.

If you need some sort of concrete explanation as to why she appears to be a girl to many people (aside from hair, eyelashes, eyebrows, blush, etc):
