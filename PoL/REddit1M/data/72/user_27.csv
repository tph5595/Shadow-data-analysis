32580,Probably because there's no reason they should all be left handed.
32605,Well that ends the barks of the overly speculative daft people at least.
32922,"I really don't think the spirit of the hero necessitates being left handed.

In fact if you want to use that logic, they should all be right handed because SS is the first Link."
35579,"It wasn't me that downvoted you.

It still shows that not all Links are left handed, so there's no reason this one has to be. There's absolutely no reason for having the spirit of the hero to make the person left-handed, it's a ridiculous proposition."
35749,"It would be very strange to keep him left handed just because.

It's an irrelevant detail, it changes absolutely nothing of any importance."
35900,"It has no bearing upon his characterisation whatsoever. It's never referenced, never mattered, makes absolutely no difference."
37260,"So what does it do for his characterisation?

Has it ever actually mattered or made a difference in any way?

What part of his right-handedness made SS worse, for example?"
37959,"So yeah, no actual bearing on him as a character or the story.

As for motion control, some people didn't get along with it, some people did. I was fine with it, but that's not to say everyone was. I liked the extra thought it brought to combat. The only thing I didn't like about it was that the way they decided to control the loftwing was silly. Not hard, just silly and not related to how he would actually control it at all.

For sword fighting and shooting I really liked it. The combat wasn't notably hard, but it was a lot more challenging than any other game. Combat is most Zelda games is too easy I find, this actually presented something more interesting.

That's just my personal preference for gameplay and I can understand why some people wouldn't like it, but the point is his handedness doesn't actually affect his character or the world at all. 'Because he's always been' is just empty sentiment."
38206,"You're saying it's important to you, but you have yet to explain why. What difference does his handedness actually make? It's never had any effect upon his personality, actions or influence, so what does it do?"
50948,"Because there's no reason to be invested in the idea of him being left-handed. It makes no difference. His clothes and face are notable differences in style and appearance, the hand he holds his sword in really doesn't make a difference.

This also has nothing to do with which hand we predominantly use. Of all the things which might be considered a social stigma and point of contention, a person's handedness is not one of them. Maybe in Victorian times, but not today."
51120,"That's fine if you don't like motion control, I'm not saying everyone should.

The fact is though that his handedness doesn't matter. It doesn't make a difference. His tunic and sword are notable features that mark him out. They change how he looks. If he fights right-handed it's still the same sword, still the same shield, just in different hands. It doesn't make any difference.

There are many things that it would be silly for Nintendo to change about Link. The hand he predominantly uses isn't one of them, it makes no difference. It didn't affect the experience of Twilight Princess (on Wii) or Skyward Sword one bit. Regardless of motion controls, even if SS were controlled completely normally it wouldn't have mattered that he was right-handed, it has no effect upon his character in any way."
52781,"That's the point though, the clothes are a tradition passed down. When it comes to personal traits it's a different person every time but with the spirit of the hero. It doesn't force them to be right-handed. Almost every Link looks different in one way or another, giving them slightly different traits emphasises the fact that they aren't actually the same person. If they were exactly the same every time it would sort of counter the point.

Changing such things (as they would realistically be different) is a good thing to me."
55034,"Yeah, nearly. The hand they hold their sword in is a pretty minor difference. I really don't think I would be a different person if I were left handed, and I don't think anyone who is left handed would be a different person if they were right handed. It's just not something that makes a big difference. It's an irrelevant detail in terms of his character and it's fine for it to be different, in the same way that his hair is usually different. I don't see anyone complaining when he has a different style and shade of hair, it's just a slight visual difference."
