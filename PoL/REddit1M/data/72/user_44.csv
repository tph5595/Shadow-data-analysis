44784,"You do know that, despite the title of the articles, that Aonuma didn't say ANYWHERE that the link in the trailer isn't female.  He only said the rumors grew and not to be too hung up on the appearance.

Just like the articles were wrong when they claimed Aonuma's quote meant that the character wasn't link (A lot of them claimed this based on the ""Nobody explicitly Said"" comment), they're again inferring something that wasn't said; that the character isn't female, which wasn't refuted in his comments."
