289485,"That, and everyone is hopping on the LGBT/feminisim trains at the slightest provocation these days. Which really irritates me. I have nothing against either, but when people start shouting ""Link looks feminine? MUST BE A GIRL! Glad to see them embracing and accepting LGBT!!!""

No. Link has always looked at least a little effeminate. It's the Japanese art style. You're just projecting what you want of the world onto the game, the character, and the developers.

I wouldn't mind playing a Zelda game with a female lead. But not Link. Link is male, he always has been. And he doesn't NEED to be anything else. Changing his from male to female now would be pandering to current ""trends""(trends meaning what people are rallying behind right now[meaning women's right, LGBT rights, etc.]) of the highest order."
