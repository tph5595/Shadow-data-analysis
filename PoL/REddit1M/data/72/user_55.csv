I get it about Japanese culture making young males look ""feminine"", but come on...he's meant to be the Hero of Hyrule.

Plus with the current screenshots we have, he really needs to eat a sandwich...or 10.

I mean, I wouldn't mind if they did a Zelda game with a female protagonist (with say Impa or Zelda herself), but Link will always be male.

Just make him look a bit more ""male"" Nintendo."
