55106,"I found it a little weird for all this hype for some people in speculating that a pre established character is a female and getting excited over it. For me, it would be like if their was a metroid trailer that showed Samus without the helmet with short hair and then saying it was a guy and making a fuss over it. I just don't see it happening and as far as I would be concerned, it would feel just as off. Sorry if I come off as an asshat. "
