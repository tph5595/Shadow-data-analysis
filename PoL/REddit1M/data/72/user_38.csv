41726,"Anggul, why are you so invested in the idea that there is no reason for Link to be left-handed? It's just as much a part of him as wearing a green tunic and having an elfin face is. Speaking as a right-handed person, unless motion controls are being used, Link should be left-handed."
51928,"Why are his clothes and face somehow more important than the hand he holds his sword in? Handedness is an innate trait of a person; clothing color absolutely is *not*. So if anything, the clothes should be less important than his handedness."

Only in Wind Waker. That's the only game where the green clothes are literally a tradition (and even then, they're only worn for one day). Every other game, green just happens to be what Link wears.

&gt; When it comes to personal traits it's a different person every time.

And yet they always look nearly identical (modulo stylistic choices of the game itself, e.g. Wind Waker style vs Twilight Princess style)."
