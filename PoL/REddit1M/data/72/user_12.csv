19336,Well that killed quite a bit of my hype for this game. I was really excited for the possibility of a zelda game without link as the protagonist and a girl to boot. But no... guess it was too much to expect nintendo to deviate that far from their formula.

Look ay games like Mass Effect that let you select your hero's gender. True the story stays the same but it really does change how other characters react and respond to your character. I dunno maybe it's just me who wants to see a female hero presented in a non sexualized way kick some bad guy ass, but I think if nintendo were to do something like that they'd get alot of praise from the fanbase and the media as well which would probably help WiiU sales which i think we can all agree need a boost."
