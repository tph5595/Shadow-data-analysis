8971,"The link doesn't work for me.

But IMO: This is totally Link or maybe Links son. But no way, this is a girl. Well just because there is a ponytail doesn't make that a girl. Link always looked this way. But for me it isn't even feminine. Also, there are no breasts a girl would have. And if it was a girl, I really doubt the developers would NOT make at least little bulges, so that you could see this is a girl. (Sheik was something different. That was a disguise)

Edit: Link works again, or maybe it was my other computer. I read it and I see no point why I've been downvoted. I just explained why I thought these speculations about ""this was a girl"" were from my point of view totally surreal. And now look. It wasn't a girl. It was Link. Surprise.

Edit2: What the hell guys? In the top comments here stands basically the same I wrote. ""This could never be a girl. These speculations are finally over"". I brought down this son thing, because the link didn't work for me and I just focused on the titles last part. I'm freaking sorry?"
