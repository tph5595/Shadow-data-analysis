37021,"I never got rid of any GameCube games because seriously, that system was underrated. I still have my original WW and TP, actually I still own my GameCube I was bought when I was in the 6th grade mostly for nostalgia. Currently on my ? run on TP, in the Ice Mansion.. I need to whip out the old NES though my brothers gave me."
