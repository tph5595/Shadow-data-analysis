rekt."
20451,Really?  The gender of the character kills the game for you?  That *matters* to you?  Especially when they're just using the character that has *always* been the main character?
20953,"You're getting downvoted because Aonuma just said it was Link, and there is literally *nothing* to suggest that he's a girl.  It's because you're just grasping at imaginary straws.  He even made the point to say that what he *originally* said was meant to be humorous.

He doesn't say ""Link is a boy"" but *nothing* suggests Link is a girl.  Lack of evidence for one thing doesn't equal evidence for another thing, especially when that other thing (that he's a girl) has literally nothing legitimate to support it.

It's like watching the Skyward Sword trailer and making the claim that Link is a girl based on the fact that Aonuma never specifically pointed out that he's a boy.  It's like suggesting that I'm Bill Gates because nobody said I was Steve Jobs.

TL;DR: If what you said gave credence to Link being a girl, it also gives credence to the fact that I am Bill Gates."
22148,"I understand you but how does having male or female genitalia shake anything up?  It's probably the least significant aspect of any videogame, let alone one where the main character doesn't even talk and is just an extension of the player."
24442,"&gt;Look at games like Mass Effect that let you select your hero's gender. True the story stays the same but it really does change how other characters react and respond to your character.

That's Mass Effect though, a game which is *heavily* based on the interactions you make with other characters.  Originally, (until EA rushed it out) those choices were supposed to determine the final outcome and ending.  It was one of the biggest 'features' about the game.

Link's interactions with characters hardly ever go into the kind of depth which would be affected by gender.  I can hardly imagine any prior interactions with him that would have changed with his gender (aside from SS's flirty bs). Maybe you're saying they should?  I was never too big on the whole thing - not to that extent, anyway.

As for the non-sexualized female characters, I agree, and that's why I have *huge* problems with Hyrule Warriors.  It's tacky as fuck, but as for sales... I think it'd hurt more than it'd help.

Many people are caught up with how 'childish' these cartoony graphics are (but I fucking love them), and with how Link *looks* girly.  If you take into consideration how turned off so many 'gamers' are by those graphics and Link's androgynous-ness, imagine how many of those same gamers would be turned off by their favorite character now *actually* becoming a girl.  You'd lose every kid (or mental kid) out there who (immaturely) has problems playing as a girl.

That kind of thing is might receive praise from certain demographics, but not the masses, and those masses are what makes sales.  It's more of a niche thing.  If Nintendo were going full-throttle for what would sell the most, they'd make another grimdark game with a 'mature', male Link like Twilight Princess, which is the #1 selling Zelda game iirc.

Not that I want them to.  I don't, but that *is* what sells, not niche ideas and curve-balls.

However my take on this whole debacle is that there will be some degree of customization for Link - maybe the ability to choose your gender.  It *is* a very common feature in open world RPGs nowadays, and they said they want to break the old conventions of Zelda."
26795,"Link has always had that little eyelash, since OoT... and what you're seeing as 'blush' is a particle effect coming from the explosion.  It's only there in one split-second frame.

As for the eyebrows.. I can't see how they look any different from any other Link.  They're probably the least feminine thing about his face.  His hair?  How does long hair = female?  Link had long hair in pretty much every game aside from TP and SS, it was just covered by a hat, unless you're trying to tell me that Edward Elric was a girl too.

Now if we're bringing bodies into this... trying to judge from three seconds of an awkward pose is silly as hell, especially considering that Zelda hasn't had realistically proportioned bodies since Majora's Mask.  Even still, most the points brought up in that simply aren't true.  His body is shaped *almost* exactly like TP/SS Link, aside from his head which is slightly larger in comparison, as the style is much more cartoony.  If you really want to get into all that, simply look at his hands, and bam - obvious boy hands.

All of the remaining points brought up here don't point to female.  They just point to a smaller, thinner figure.. which is pretty much exactly what you'll find on the teenage version of a fit adult, especially one that has taken on a *cartoon* look, which is something people supporting this ""theory"" seem to be willfully ignoring."
26975,"Don't lose your hope, I still believe there's gonna be some kind of character customization.  I don't think it's outside the spectrum of belief that you'll be able to pick gender.  Link's point as a character is to be ""the player"" as Aonuma just stated again earlier today."
31181,"They're not.  They've already confirmed that it's using the gamepad, and they lightly talked about the features it will use.

Plus... The Wii U doesn't come with any motion controls.  Why would they release a game for Wii U, that doesn't support Wii U's own controller, ignores the *primary feature* of the Wii U, and instead makes you buy hardware from the previous gen?  Nonsense."
31394,"&gt;but at least he had manly features

Where?  OoT Link was the only 'manly' one.  Everything after that, Link looked as androgynous as could be."
34579,"That is concept art from Brawl, not the actual game, and he's *anything* but manly.  TP Link looks about 5'5, maybe 150lbs.  He's a shrimp with a very pretty-boy face and not a single 'manly' feature."
35301,"To you, maybe.  That face would fit a girl perfectly if you were to slap on a female body.  He even has what looks like eyeliner."
35710,"A gyroscope hardly counts as motion controls.  You can't exactly use it to swing a sword, unless you consider Wind Waker HD's controls to be ""motion controls"" as well.

They *could* use motion controls, but **they already said what they're going to use**.  They're not gonna ignore the Wii U's primary feature for something that was regarded as hit or miss last gen, they're not gonna alienate people who don't have the hardware, and they're *certainly* not going to release a game that doesn't support its own console's controller, especially after talking about how that controller was designed with Zelda in mind.

&gt;4Gamer: How is the new Wii U title coming along?

&gt;Eiji Aonuma: Of course it's moving along. We also have to reflect on what we did with Wind Waker for our next title. Since Wind Waker HD was a remake, there were limits to what we could do with the Wii U GamePad, but for a new title, we can utilize it to the fullest.

&gt;4Gamer: So people who have played Wind Waker HD can expect some of those elements to carry over onto the next game.

&gt;Eiji Aonuma: I believe so. For example, on the Wii U GamePad, you have a map display on the screen. This map isn't just for the sea, it's also for other locations as well. We will reflect on these sort of things for a new game. "
42865,"I don't know what you think men look like, but they typically don't look like intentionally androgynous anime characters.

Point out to me just one specifically 'manly' feature that TP Link has.  Just one."
