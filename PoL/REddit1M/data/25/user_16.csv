8396,"it's crazy how many rupee farming guides i've seen.  as long as you smash all the ore cores you see and actively seek to collect rupees as you explore, the game showers you in $$$.

really, the only rupee tip that matters is to swap out your iron sledgehammer everytime you see a new one.

i have 25k rupees.  and probably another ~30k in ore."
