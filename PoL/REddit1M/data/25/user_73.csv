24927,"It actually doesn't have a longer range than any other bow. Its range is 40, which it shares with 5 other bows (Swallow, Falcon, Great Eagle, Phrenic and Duplex) and its range is outclassed by the Bow of Light (500 Range) and the Twilight Bow (8,000 range).

It does, however, have the highest durability of any bow in the game (120 durability), 20 higher than both the Bow of Light and Twilight Bow (which sit at 100 each).

It also, as others have pointed out, does indeed gain the 80% damage buff from the Ancient Proficiency set bonus.

All around it's a very, very good bow, and while it cannot be matched in durability, it is outclassed in terms of damage by a Savage Lynel Bow with maxed multiple arrows (32x5=160 base damage + 50% Attack from a High Level attack up buff =240 whereas the Ancient Bow 44 base damage + 130% from Ancient Proficiency and a High Level attack up buff =102.5 damage.)

The Ancient bow statistically can never beat a x5 multiple arrow Savage Lynel Bow. Not even against guardians in terms of raw power. It is very durable, however, and has TWICE the range of a Lynel Bow, so if that is what you are looking for in a weapon, I would still recommend buying one or two to have on hand."
25345,"You math is slightly off there. The 50% additional damage and 80% additional damage are additive, not multiplicative. The two bonuses together do 130% more base damage. 44x2.3=101.2 damage."
