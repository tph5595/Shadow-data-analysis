20505,"For Naydra, teleport to...I forget the shrine name, but it's the one in Lanaryu Promenade behind the waterfall. Take the small path out (if you touched any water, you went the wrong way) and climb the wall directly to your left. You'll be on a cliff of sorts. Walk along until you get a good view of Mt. Lanaryu and the rest of the promenade and wait. You should see Naydra come down from the mountain and meander towards your location. Drop down, gliding if necessary to position or stall, and take an airshot or two. Glide with the updrafts until you can see where the dragon part lands."
20763,"My first encounter with Guardians were the trio of decayed ones outside the shrine on the plateau. Then while exploring the area west of Kakariko I found some spider ones, one of which saw me while I was climbing a cliff and I narrowly escaped a direct hit.

Then I got Stasis+. And after that I got ancient arrows. And after *that* I realized that killing a Guardian gets you a whole pile of ancient parts.

Now I just need money..."
20810,Is there an easy way to stock up on bomb arrows? They're expensive to buy.
20892,And I'm just imagining someone getting lucky with this drop while still on the plateau.
21003,"They're a rare-but-not-stupid drop from Guardians, more commonly the mobile spider ones in my experience. Get a few ancient arrows, find one, approach out of LOS as much as possible, and let it see you. It should remain mostly immobile as it charges up, which is a perfect opportunity for a shot to the eye. With an ancient arrow, that'll be an instant kill. Enjoy the explosions, and take a selfie if you want.

Stasis+ works wonders too. You have to wait until it wears off to damage it, but it'll halt their charging and buy you time to get into position."
21074,"I stopped bothering with the sledgehammer once I realized bombs can blow apart ore deposits, but it sounds like I'm not getting all the ore I can this way. Y/N?"
21163,"I'm still working out a good set of Talus to farm, honestly. Plus how to kill them without murdering one of my weapons in the process."
22728,"Huh, I had heard once that you needed to do some amount of damage so if your bow was weak enough you'd need multiple arrows."
27229,"Ooh, source on that datamine? Sounds interesting."
