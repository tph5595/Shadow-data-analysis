8199,44 * 1.8 (ancient proficiency) * 1.5 (Mighty cooked dish 3 swords) * 2 (headshot)= 237.6
8234,"Ancient Bow is best bow.

**Period**"
8570,"Yes it does. Oh yes it does.

**It feels as amazing as it sounds**."
8929,Time to go bananas.
9325,The Twilight Bow does not get the bonus damage modifier that the Ancient Bow can get from *Ancient Proficiency* (80% damage bonus).
9948,"44 * 1.8 (ancient proficiency) * 1.5 (Mighty cooked dish 3 swords) * 2 (headshot) * 2 (frozen) = 475.2

If it's a Guardian that can be frozen include another 1.5 for a grand total of **712.8**."
10609,"You can, at the very least, turn a Ancient Short Sword into a 108 damage monster against them."
12459,"Get the Armor first, then the bow, then the short sword, then the shield.

Always upgrade your armor first. Save at minimum three giant ancient cores for them.

EDIT: 6 giant cores, not 3."
13849,"And it also stacks with food bonuses (Mighty cooked food for example.)

We enter the absurd realm of 356 damage head shots on Guardians.
"
14321,"I'll take Guardians over Lynels given the choice.

They're quite easy at this point lategame. Lynels require a higher skill level to beat."
14652,"I believe you only need three Star Fragments.

Silver Lynels rarely drop Star Fragments if the RNG God isn't being kind."
15782,Ancient Armor is really the only thing worth using Star Fragments for.
17013,"How are you getting 400 damage?

400 / 2 = 200 non-head shot.

200 / 1.5 = ~133 no food boosts.

133 / 3 = 44 damage per shot. Where are you finding this bow? Screen shot of it?

Also the arrows spread out on a horizontal axis so getting head shots with all three arrows is difficult at most ranges."
17983,"So basically:

Ancient Bow: rifle

Savage Lynel Bow: shotgun."
18167,"I find it strange because I killed a Silver Lynel and he dropped a 32x3 bow for me, not a 32x5.
"
18660,"It also looks like the Ancient Bow wouldn't over take Lynel x 5 even if it were a guardian.

Ancient Bow still has more utility for long range shots and is easier to get in comparison. I wonder if it has more durability than the Lynel x  5."
21813,Those higher-end Lynel Swords would be stronger.
22411,"90 sword + barbarin armor = 135 damage.

Pretty *savage*."
82524,"Most of them from what little I know are just re-skins. (ex: Fierce Deity is a reskin of Barbarian armor).

Many of them require Star Fragments and don't have stats that are better than in-game armor."
