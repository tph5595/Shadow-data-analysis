31206,Past that it's actually pretty easy to farm star fragments! [This guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/5znjih/i_figure_out_the_falling_star_mechanics_stars/) breaks it down and I can confirm it's that reliable and straightforward. A little time consuming to wait ~10 minutes or so from 12pm to night for each star to fall but great to do while doing other things while you wait.
