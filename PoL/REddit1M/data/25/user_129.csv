94911,"Heh. I don't like things sitting around waiting to be used. That shield had looked after me since i got ballsy and raised the castle on an NPC's suggestion. When i used it a few times I realised how sturdy it was, and then i noticed it wasn't breaking. Not ever.  Not until long after any other shield would have."

I too have trouble with weapons not breaking fast enough. My solution was to throw them more. "
