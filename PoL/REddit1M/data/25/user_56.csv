Hit them in the face, run up and mount with a 2h weapon and get in 5 free hits, run away, hit them in the face, run up and mount, repeat.  Now that I have the rhythm down I can usually cheese out even a silver Lynel without much issue."

[Here's a video of someone staggering the lynel with Urbosa's Fury](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w3e3pPhVnyQ) and then mounting it, so I guess you can even trigger it in other ways."
