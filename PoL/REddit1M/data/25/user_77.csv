26020,"Imagine a really powerful crossbolt.  Now imagine a not-so-amazing crossbow.  You fire off the bolt.  It sticks into a tree, but the bow gets frayed. 

You pull out the bolt with some effort.  Still perfect condition somehow. 

Fire it again.  The bow suddenly snaps.  

The bolt, after you pull it out of whatever it flew into, is OK.  The bow, not so much. 

Same idea, but instead of crossbow, imagine a recurve.  "
