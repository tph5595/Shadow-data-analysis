16030,"""Doing my part to stop the nonsense""

Being a jerk doesn't usually 'stop' anything. I guarantee that you will get kinder responses and better results by not being a complete and utter jerk. Doesn't matter what they call it, so there's no point in speaking anyway."
16266,"People are making them seem like more of a threat than they actually are. You can parry their lasers with any shield, if you suck at parrying like I did, practice. If you still suck or don't want to practice, just shoot them in the eye with a normal arrow, hit them a couple times, shoot again, hit again, and so on. Not only are they easy to kill, you can hide behind them and the other guardians will just forget about you."
16817,"Savage Lynel Bow can do 400 damage, no need for the set bonus."
16891,The shield is also really good. I can shield surf for like an hour before I have one of them break.
17415,"Okay, if you hear ever overhear someone in public misusing a word or term, go up to them and say ""Fuck you, you're a moron"", then for your next encounter say ""Hi, I couldn't help but overhear you, ____ actually means ____"". See which one will get you smacked, punched or an earful of well deserved insults.

And if *that* isn't what you meant, then no, I am not wrong in thinking that it really does not matter and that there is no point in you leaving your foul stench in the presence of decent folk. It does not affect you, why do you even care?"

Anyway, if you're going to be using the ancient bow at range, chances are that there are silver enemies, which even with the Savage Lynel Bow they don't take that much damage, so they'll just run to your position. Might as well run in and kill them all quicker with the Lynel bow."
17981,"I am very self aware, and you'll get respect when you show that you deserve it. So far that's a huge

#no"
18028,"Essentially, I just find it to be much easier with the Lynel bow"
18212,It's not 100%. It's like for every 3 x5 I get 1 x3.
18975,"Definitely, there's a huge difference, and the Lynel bows are some of the most durable."
94704,But why would you want to remove that satisfying sparkle from the icon? :O
95175,"I feel the same way. I have an inventory full of weapons and shields and I want to use them up ASAP, but I just can't drop them... You can actually buy the shield again, it's not that expensive either."
