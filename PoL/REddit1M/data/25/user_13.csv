Being near the dragons causes updrafts; you can just fly right next to them and hit them from close range."

As soon as he (or any dragon) gets close, updrafts start, and you can easily paraglide right up to him and hit him from close range, no special bow required. It's super easy to do once you know where to reliably find him and realize you can paraglide up to him."
