31440,What a hassle this would cause for timeline placement if all three are actually what you say they are. =P
31671,"That was actually my first thought as well; it definitely felt like a giant Dodongo of some kind, but it being one of the whales could work as well."
38582,"In that case, does that not still cause a problem? If it's possible that all of these creatures/beings have a placement in the lore before the split, then the evidence of their appearance in BotW is still mudded when comparing the possibilities. Especially with the Wind Fish only truly appearing in one timeline but having a fairly recognizable reference in another (during Majora's Mask), and the Ocean King's realm potentially being another cross-dimension location.

Regardless, there's still some issue to be had. Silly ol' timeline."
