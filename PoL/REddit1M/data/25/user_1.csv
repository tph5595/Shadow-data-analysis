690,"Dude, I literally just turned my computer on when I got to work and was thinking about this **EXACT** same topic. I actually navigated to this board to post a PSA about the Ancient Bow, only to see that someone beat me to the punch! No worries though, because I certainly am glad to see this topic.

I'm sure by now tons of people have at least seen that its available, but haven't tried it yet. Like /u/killzone3265 said, get this bow. Immediately. I was in the same boat as well. When I first fired up the blue flame at the Akkala Ancient Tech Lab, I wasn't too sure about this bow because of the high price tag and the fact that it takes a giant ancient core to make. However, do not let this deter you. Do what I did and read the item description of the Ancient Bow. It says something to the effect of, ""Arrows fired from this bow travel in a straight line."" While that description itself can be semi-misleading, it still holds mostly true. The arrows fired from the bow do actually arc down a bit, but **nothing** like typical bows. Once I figured out how valuable this bow was, I dropped all my royal bows and made five Ancient Bows. Now my inventory consists of six ancient bows and four savage Lynel bows. The Ancient Bow is my bow of choice, and I would encourage all of you BotW players to get it ASAP. Once you use it, you'll never go back.

Great topic, OP. Great topic! If I could upvote this a hundred times, I would."
5194,"Yep, it can, but it's ridiculously weak when using it for anything other than dragon farming. When you use the Ancient Bow, not only do you get the steady-arrow effect, you benefit from the ""Ancient Proficiency"" armor skill (if you're wearing full Ancient Armor upgraded to at least ★★), which boosts the attack of the bow by 80%!

12582,So you're one of those people that comments to start arguments rather than contribute to the conversation. Good to know. I know plenty well what a PSA is. I had no plans of actually calling it a PSA in the title. It would've been something similar to what OP posted. Thanks for the concern though.
