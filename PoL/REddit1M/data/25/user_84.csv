28079,"&gt; The Ancient bow statistically can never beat a x5 multiple arrow Savage Lynel Bow. Not even against guardians in terms of raw power.

this conclusion is correct, but your damage calculation for ancient weapons is wrong. ancient proficiency bonus, attack buffs, and damage bonus to guardians by guardian/ancient weapons all stack multiplicatively with one another (see test results [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/5z22f1/botw_damage_modifier_test_results/)). so ancient set + ancient bow damage on a guardian is 44 * 1.8 * 1.5 * 1.5 = 178. which is still lower than a x5 savage lynel bow of 32 * 5 * 1.5 = 240, assuming you land all 5 of your arrows."
