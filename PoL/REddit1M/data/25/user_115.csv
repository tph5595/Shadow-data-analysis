44104,Don't think you need any star pieces to get all of the armor to level 2. 
44855,Just checked and you only need a star piece to get it to Lvl 4. 
49571,True; unless your fighting Guardians and/or using ancient equipment against them. 
50938,"haha When I read Hylian Trousers for some reason I thought you were talking about the Hateno set.

The Haton set is frigging great. Same stats as the best armor in the game (I believe) but it doesn't have any bonuses. Still a good set that you can upgrade fast to get you going though."
