8894,"now I'm curious, what are the properties of the other ancient items (especially since I got half of the cost of this ancient shortsword refunded thanks to the quest in hateno that made me get it)

I know that the shield has an auto-parry against guardian beams, but do the others do anything special?"
9255,"Technically the Twilight bow is better on paper (slightly lower base damage but has 20% higher durability, perfectly straight shots (no drop AT ALL, they fly until they despawn or hit something), generates its own arrows, each arrow does a bonus 100 damage), but good luck getting one, it's a VERY rare drop from the SSB Zelda Amiibo &gt;_&gt;"
9700,"&gt; (80% damage bonus).

jesus, that much? 0_o

I thought it was something like a 20% bonus or something, but nearly fucking DOUBLE?

I wonder what the theoretical max is for both bows? (assuming no additional weapon modifiers)"
10501,"it's a shame Lynels can't be frozen, I could get behind 13-shotting a silver lynel :P"
10730,"welp, looks like I have my use for the sword I got during the weapon connoisseur questline :D"
11330,"you know how the shields you get from the trials of combat can reflect guardian scout beams if you block them even without a parry?

the ancient shield can do that to the big guardians."
11546,"unfortunately it does, though nowhere near as badly as other shields, so parries are technically better even with the ancient/guardian shields, but it's nice to carry one around just in case :P"
37669,"Technically only Oshus would cause issues:

Levias is in SS and predates the split

The wind fish isn't necessarily exclusive to downfall, only its interaction with the Hero Of Legend

Oshus technically also exists in all timelines, but his realm is implied to be a Termina style alternate reality that only really became accessible due to the Great Sea, which raises the question of wtf he's doing in Hyrule "
95480,"If you hit parry it parries as usual.

If you don't hit parry it uses durability but reflects the beam anyway.

If you try to parry but miss you get a laser to the face.

This only works against guardians and scouts though, everything else acts like normal."
