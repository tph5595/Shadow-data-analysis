25832,Time in Hyrule is convoluted.
26115,Can you explain the OoT being a prequel to A Link To the Past? I can't really think of any direct connections off of the top of my head.
27522,"It's a Dark Souls reference about how time in Lordran is convoluted and leads to historical/legendary figures all appearing within the same player experience.

tl;dr it was a joke"
27592,"Hmm I suppose but I don't see Ocarina's events as a ""Great Sealing War"". It was mostly Link and Zelda vs Ganon rather than large armies."
28759,"Well the timeline was kind of a massive retcon to force something that was never there. I don't really subscribe to it too much since I imagine a lot of the future games will break it over and over, or at least I hope the devs won't ever feel tied down to it. (So far it seems they have no qualms going against it)"
28948,"No problem dude. :)

And don't worry about it too much I only played DSIII last year. (My first DS game)"
29311,"Ah, I'm not the best to ask. I've only played 3 and am in the middle of a ""pass the controller"" playthrough of Bloodborne with my roommate. That being said I like them both a lot but I would recommend asking someone who's played all of them."
30943,Yeah I think that's the best route. Not concretely adhering to the timeline allows the devs to have more creative freedom while still allowing them to give vague links to other games.
