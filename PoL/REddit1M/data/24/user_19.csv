23690,"A bigger problem I have that I mentioned elsewhere is this, if this is the downfall timeline, then why are the river Zora completely absent(something found ONLY in that timeline)with no explanation or even reference of their existence and the gorons prominently at death mountain when they were established to be long gone by that point.

Sure you can make ""what if"" scenarios, but to me the sudden disappearance and reappearance of entire races is harder to rectify for me then ""maybe they distorted what happened to a single person"" (Ruto/Nobooru), and it's not really the same situation as say, koroks who could've been there off screen because their location is never visited.


The only thing we can say is adult is probably the least likely because it has the weakest connection and makes the least sense, but it's obvious they didn't care much for any hard continuity."
24074,"I always took the heroes shade to be more a case of ""my adventuring life is over,  and now I have to live on this backwater farm"" because not being recognized doesn't make any sense. A kid comes from the future with knowledge apparently convincing enough to get the king on his side, and prevents a coup and gets the villain executed. How is he not a hero again?

Then there's the fact people like Faron(light spirit) directly (and others if I recall) address him being a hero in the past tense when there's no reason he could, or should have knowledge about alternate dimensions.you could say he was referring to skyward sword with the heroes clothes and such, but that clearly wasn't the intent.

The ""not being remembered"" bit never made much sense.
