34509,"I've yet to see confirmation of the claim that Zelda references events from other games while the Champion's are speaking. People have said this occurs in the English and German versions, at the very least.

The only way we can actually confirm this would be if someone can isolate the audio for Zelda's voice during this scene. And then, if we hear different things for different languages, we'd have to defer to the Japanese version for the intended speech.

Until these things happen, these claims are only rumors."

The adult timeline is impossible. This is the only placement that we can definitely rule out."

All other explanations for the Rito, Koroks, rock salt, and other adult timeline references are more plausible than this."

Any Zelda game that takes place in the traditional Hyrule can only exist in the Adult Timeline if it occurs before

58522,"How do you figure Link and Zelda remaining in New Hyrule, instead of somehow - for some reason - returning to an un-flooded old Hyrule, is ""assuming a lot""?

You're making a *lot* of leaps here, my friend.

BotW Hyrule contains many of the landmarks of the traditional Hyrule. New Hyrule does not. Even if the entire ocean disappeared, New Hyrule would still be New Hyrule. It would not have the Temple of Time, Death Mountain, Lost Woods, Deku Tree, Lake Hylia, Gerudo Desert, etc.

BotW Hyrule obviously has nothing to do with New Hyrule. And if the ocean disappeared, why would the Royal Family leave New Hyrule - an established kingdom - for the ruins of old Hyrule? How would they even find old Hyrule again?

Like I said, you made a *lot* of leaps there."
61607,"&gt; Not really. New Hyrule is far smaller than old Hyrule, and it doesn't even take place that far into the timeline. Zelda is Tetra's Great, Great Granddaughter, and Link seems to have no relation with the hero of wind. We can pretty much assume Spirit Tracks only takes place a few hundrend years after Phantom Hourglass.

Actually, I'm pretty sure it is stated in-game that Spirit Tracks only takes place 100 years after PH.

&gt; Evidence says the world was once flooded in salt water (rock salt deposits EVERYwhere, and a LOT of mountains indicate erosion) Rito being a race as well as the Koroks also point to it taking place in the Adult Timeline. To add to that, the Rito seemingly never left the Great Sea above Old Hyrule. They aren't anywhere to be seen in Phantom, or Spirit Tracks. I am simply using the evidence shown in the game.

The evidence we have in game is that there is rock salt, Koroks, and Rito. Your theories about these things are not evidence - they are assumptions. 

The rock salt could just as likely come from the Lanayru Sea in SS - which may very well have covered the Surface long ago. Similar deposits of salt are actually discovered IRL fairly often. It is not a unique phenomenon, and it is not something that can be exclusively attributed to a divine-intervention flooding. 

As you say, 10,000 years is a long time. The Rito and Koroks were able to evolve from the Kokiri and the Zora in a much shorter span of time before Wind Waker. Therefore, there is no reason that they could not evolve in BotW.

And while we are on the topic on races, in Wind Waker it is strongly implied that the Zora no longer exist. The entire reason that the Zora evolved into the Rito was that they could not survive in the Great Sea. 

Meanwhile, in BotW, we see that the Rito evolved alongside the Zora. This evolutionary path contradicts the one we saw in Wind Waker - as the Zora should no longer exist in the Adult Timeline.

These explanations for the inclusion of rock salt, the Koroks, and the Rito are all much more plausible than Link and Zelda returning to old Hyrule. I already explained why this is incredibly unlikely in my last post. It requires us to make several wild assumptions with absolutely zero backing from in-game evidence."
110633,"**Here is my response to another poster who was making the same arguments. I addressed all of their points individually. This should serve as a comprehensive break down of why an Adult Timeline placement is incredibly unlikely**

The Adult Timeline is impossible because the spirit of the hero and the reincarnation of Hylia are now in New Hyrule.

Any Zelda game that takes place in the traditional Hyrule can only exist in the Adult Timeline if it occurs before Wind Waker. Since BotW takes place so far into the future, this placement is impossible.

It would require a massive leap in logic to assume that Link and Zelda would leave New Hyrule - an established kingdom - for the ruins of old Hyrule, which have conveniently re-emerged from the sea. How would they even find old Hyrule again?

&gt; Ruto was a sage according to this game, this is only possible in the adult timeline.

This is false. Ruto was a sage in the Fallen Timeline, and she may potentially be remembered as a sage in the Child Timeline - depending on what Link told Zelda after returning to the present.

&gt; Koroks exist en mass indicating that they prospered and their plan to rehabilitate the land beneath the sea worked.

As you say, 10,000 years is a long time. The Koroks were able to evolve from the Kokiri in a much shorter span of time before Wind Waker. Therefore, there is no reason that they could not evolve in BotW.

&gt; Rito exist. Rito have only ever been seen as a race in Wind Waker... This is pretty obvious proof to anyone honestly. I realize some people now think there is a converging timeline because Zora also exist, but the only statement we've ever heard on that matter was ONE interview with Aonuma where he stated that Kokiri, and Zora evolved into Korok, and Rito respectively. It's fully possible that this was retconned, since it's never been fully and officially published. It's not too hard to believe this.

In Wind Waker it is strongly implied that the Zora no longer exist. The entire reason that the Zora evolved into the Rito was that they could not survive in the Great Sea. Meanwhile, in BotW, we see that the Rito evolved alongside the Zora. This evolutionary path contradicts the one we saw in Wind Waker - as the Zora should no longer exist in the Adult Timeline.

We also know that the Rito evolved from the Zora because the old Earth Sage was Zora. The Rito in WW also have an emblem resembling the Zora's Sapphire. The WW Deku Tree tells us directly that the Koroks once assumed human forms, and the old Wind Sage was a Kokiri.

&gt; Rock Salt deposits EVERYWHERE. We're talking every mountain. This isn't the Lanayru Sand Sea here - this is everywhere. This Hyrule is also technically much larger than any other Hyrule.

With regard to the rock salt, it could just as likely come from the Lanayru Sea in SS - which may very well have covered the Surface long ago. Similar deposits of salt are actually discovered IRL fairly often. It is not a unique phenomenon, and it is not something that can be exclusively attributed to a divine-intervention flooding.

&gt; Because of these points it's pretty obvious that a simple retcon of the Zora's evolution chain proves that the Adult Timeline is correct. That's seriously the only factor in the way.

And this here looks like the crux of the issue. Proposing a ""retcon"" to force your theory to fit is pretty solid evidence that you are choosing to only see what you want to see. You're twisting the lore to fit in the way that you have decided it should fit, instead of looking at all of the evidence with an unbiased mind.

Saying Nintendo ""probably retconned this"" does not make for a compelling argument.

As I said earlier, the Adult Timeline is impossible because the spirit of the hero and the reincarnation of Hylia are now in New Hyrule."
129191,"&gt; Well, you're responding to me with a bunch of arguments that I haven't made, so if you're not going to take the time to address me directly then I'm not really going to waste my own time diving into this.

What I posted directly responded to all of the points you made. But if can't be bothered to back up your claims, thats fine.

&gt; I would argue that this is exactly what you are doing with your ""the Rito/Koroks evolved in the other timelines too"" argument. You're ignoring and hand-waving away the evidence that doesn't support your theory, while coming up with equally-wild explanations for the things that you like and treating them as fact.

I think you're misunderstanding what a retcon is. Nothing I suggested contradicts anything we know about the Zelda series. It only contradicted the timeline placement that you have decided that you want to believe. However, placing BotW after WW actually *would* require a retcon. As I pointed out in the meat of the post that you have conveniently chosen to disregard, the Zora no longer exist in WW. Therefore, if we assume an Adult Timeline placement, they should not exist in BotW. But they do.

&gt; Downfall: The Master Sword is explicitly said to have slept ""FOREVER"" after the events of Link to the Past. And indeed, it doesn't show up in any of the subsequent games in that timeline. This is a minor detail that could be easily retconned, but as you said above, we're not accepting retcons here. This is at least as strong as your ""no one ever returned to Old Hyrule"" argument -- probably stronger, because this was directly stated in-game, as opposed to your conjecture about what the characters did or didn't do after Phantom Hourglass/Spirit Tracks.

Have you played A Link Between Worlds? We already know that the Master Sword is used after ALttP. This is a retcon - but it is not a retcon decided by some random fan on the internet to make their pet theory true. It was retconned by the developers. Lets not pretend that these are the same thing.

&gt; Child: The Zora's well-kept history specifically chronicles the events of the Adult/Downfall timeline, in which Ruto was awakened as a sage and fought with Link against Ganon. The child timeline is the only place where this didn't happen, which pretty clearly rules it out as a candidate. Your theory of ""Oh, maybe Link told them about it and they wrote it down in their history"" is pretty weak and is just as unsupported by the official events of the game as any of the other suggestions.

No disagreement here. It is a weak explanation. I was merely pointing out that, since it is a possibility, it is not grounds to rule out the Child Timeline.

&gt; The truth is that BotW mixes elements from all of the timelines, and fitting it into any one of them is going to require some logical leaps. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if the official answer is that this game represents a Dragon Break-style event where the timelines have been rejoined/reset in some way.

You're absolutely correct. The issue is, you have selected the timeline that requires the *largest* logical leaps - by a fair margin."
212903,"&gt; In Wind Waker it is strongly implied that the Zora no longer exist. The entire reason that the Zora evolved into the Rito was that they could not survive in the Great Sea. Meanwhile, in BotW, we see that the Rito evolved alongside the Zora. This evolutionary path contradicts the one we saw in Wind Waker - as the Zora should no longer exist in the Adult Timeline.

This is what I said about the Zora.

If by canon, you mean stated outright in the game then no. I only stated that it was strongly implied. 

But if your concept of proof is direct textual statements as opposed to ""beyond a reasonable doubt"", then you don't have any ""proof"" for any of the things that you claim are evidence of the Adult Timeline anyway.

This concrete definition of ""proof"" makes just about any BotW timeline placement impossible."
218049,"How did we get from ""not directly stated in-game"" to ""made up by fans""?

&gt; The explanation and **handwaving** required to justify the Rito and Koroks existing in any other timeline

Speaking of ""handwaving""...

&gt; We didn't see their evolutionary path in Wind Waker. All we saw was a race of birds that descended from the Zora, and no actual Zora hanging around the islands

Also, while we're in the topic of handwaving, you have conveniently left out the damning evidence that Link and Zelda no longer exist in Hyrule.

Do you honestly find it more likely that a) Link, Zelda, and the Royal Family decided to leave New Hyrule - an established kingdom, b) old Hyrule became un-flooded, c) everyone decided to go back to old Hyrule - a ruined kingdom, and d) they were actually able to *find* old Hyrule?

You think all of that is likely, but you don't think the Rito and Koroks could be in another timeline?

Do you see how your perception of what is ""likely"" is being colored by your desire to place the game in the Adult Timeline?

"
219714,"&gt; Is there some third option I'm missing? I guess ""stated by the developers"" could count as canon too, but as far as I know they haven't made any more concrete statements on this subject than what's already in the game.

Implied by the game and developers is a big difference from ""made up by fans"".

&gt; Why would anyone decide to go looking for old Hyrule? Well, it happens to be the last known resting place of the Triforce: the ultimate power of the gods that has the ability to reshape reality itself according to the whims of its owner. I can see why that would be a slight incentive to go looking for it. Given that it's the centerpiece of the entire series, I find it more unlikely that people wouldn't eventually go looking for the Triforce and just forget about it forever.

But why would they leave behind their home to do so?

&gt; I also don't understand why you keep saying that finding old Hyrule would be a challenge at all. First, I might be forgetting something from the end of Wind Waker or from PH/ST, but from what I remember it was just Link, Tetra, and the pirates that left Old Hyrule in search of a new kingdom. Obviously other people had made the trek by the time of Spirit Tracks, but is it stated that absolutely everyone left the islands of the Great Sea? I assumed there were still people living on Dragon Roost, Windfall, etc. And even if you assume that no one stayed, and even if you assume that they kept zero record of where they used to live, they could still just sail around the general area until they spotted a giant mountain or a tower sticking out of the sea. Someone's going to stumble on it eventually.

Do you understand how big the ocean is? Leaving old Hyrule was one thing. They just sailed until they found land. They weren't seeking a specific destination.

Seeking out a specific point in the vast ocean though? That is much different. And much less likely to be accomplished. Do you understand why sailing until you find land, and sailing for a specific destination are two totally different things?

Also, why are you assuming that other people left old Hyrule to follow Link and Tetra? Why/how would they do this? Nothing suggests that this is the case.

&gt; Yes. I don't find any of those things to be problematic at all.

If you actually, genuinely believe this then I really can't help you. You seem content to connect the dots however you see fit. Feel free to believe whatever you want."
232392,"&gt; The Rito issue is the #1 thing that immediately rules out the Downfall/Child timelines for me. It is 100% canon that the Rito evolved as a response to the flooding of Hyrule.

Two things here:

1. The Rito evolved for this reason *in the Adult Timeline.* This fact has no bearing on the other timelines, or any events that may or may not take place within them. Therefore, while it is canon that the Rito that we see in Wind Waker evolved as a response to the flooding of Hyrule - it is not canon that the Rito do not exist in other timelines.

This is where you are conflating fact with assumption. So if this is the cornerstone of your whole argument, then you don't have a very strong foundation.

2. Going off of what you stated in an earlier post, we can only consider something proof if it is explicitly stated in-game. Is there anything within the Wind Waker that *explicitly tells us that the Rito evolved in response to the flooding of Hyrule?* I may be wrong, but to my knowledge there is not.

Therefore, according to your own self-imposed rules, this was just ""made up by fans"".

This is where you are applying rules differently to things that support your beliefs, and things that contradict them. Like your skewed perception of how likely certain events are over others.

So, as I have pointed out, nothing concerning the Rito in any timeline contradicts any existing canon. And, the Adult Timeline requires the greatest number and degree of asusmptions as we have to assume that a series of unlikely events brought Link and Zelda back to old Hyrule.

It seems that you are aware that the Adult Timeline requires the greatest amount of extraneous and unsupported theorizing. Now that I have demonstrated that your belief that the other timelines would defy canon is inaccurate - what reason is there to believe the Adult Timeline?"
