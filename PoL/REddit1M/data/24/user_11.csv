20079,"Looking at Zelda, Mario, Pokemon, Donkey Kong, and others, Nintendo doesn't seem too worried about connecting their games in an ""episodic"" kind of way. My take on it, is that the creators care more about the story within a single game than connecting it to the rest of the games. When creating BoTW, they could have easily crafted the story to fit around existing story elements from other games, but they didn't. As much as we want a ""big picture"", I honestly don't think it exists here, and I think it would be limiting to the creators of the series to impose that kind of rigidity. That being said, we do of course have common building blocks of Zelda games, which Skyward Sword helped lay out. Personally, I like that every Zelda game I embark on, I can count on a brand new adventure."
22620,Hahaha too true. The truth is just not as interesting.
24091,"It's a nice thought, but I don't agree. I think the creators focused on creating the singular best game that they could without linking them to past games (heh). BoTW has so many story elements that are unique to the game, and don't fit with any other LoZ game, and I think that's a good thing. With each game, the creators are free to re imagine the franchise and take risks. Nintendo creates the game that they want to create, without much thought to what fans think they want. I would have said I wanted another OoT with more realistic (western) graphics and on a bigger scale. I thought I wanted a mature game; I did NOT want more cell shading. Turns out BoTW is the game I didn't know I wanted. Nintendo will continue to deliver Zelda games that take risks. They are unique and not ""episodic"". They continue to redefine LoZ over and over, which I think is exactly what I think is going on."

Edit: I'd also like to add that I don't see any indication of BoTW intentionally trying to create a unified story. To me, the exact opposite is true. I only see completely disconnected references to past games that don't even make sense to each other. (Lon Lon Ranch + Beetle + Temple of Time + Koroks, etc.)"
