36660,"It's a merged timeline. I am almost certain. I know a lot of people don't want it to be, but it's the most plausible AND it is most likely tied with the events that happened 10,000 years ago.

There are just way too many DIRECT references to all the other games. Actual, physical places that exist in the world. Actual characters named. Actual items that reference the past cultures. Either this game is a merged timeline, or it is its own separate game in its own separate timeline that just so happens to include everything from all previous games.

Remember, all a timeline is, is an alternate dimension. The same characters and the same world at the same time can be doing completely separate things because of alternate dimensions.

My theory is that something 10,000 years ago, when Hyrule was at its most technologically advanced, merged a lot of the alternate dimensions into one, creating the Hyrule we see in BotW.

It is my theory that maybe one day in the probably very distant future, we could see a game that centers around a Link that travels between dimensions or even a game where you play multiple versions of Link within the same game."
