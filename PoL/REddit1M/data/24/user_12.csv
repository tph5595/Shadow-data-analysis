21140,"The best explanation so far is that BotW is a [Dragon Break](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Break) where the timelines of all the other games happened and have merged into a shared timeline, even though the occurrence of certain events in one timeline make events in another timeline impossible.

So separately the three agreed upon timelines happened after OoT, then at some indeterminate point in the future, Ganon [decided to eschew reincarnation and instead burst into the world as the Calamity](/spoilers) and as a result all the timelines merged. This happened 10,100 years before BotW, so by the time of BotW all the legends and truths have blended together. The timeline is moot, but they know all that stuff happened."
