0,"So... Many people mention the 'skyward, time and twilight' reference in one cutscene... But there is a problem. In the German version (and most likely the other versions to since the European translation is closer to Japanese than the American one) there are even more references. She also mentioning the Master Sword 'crossing the ocean and making a link to the past' in the background while the others are talking. Clearly she means Wind Waker and A Link to the Past.
So she references all three timelines in this cutscene. It's not a confirmation for the Child timeline..."

And there are many references in the locations... We have Linebeck Island, Rauru Village ruins, Sahashra hills etc."

And adult timeline make no sense... Hyrule was destroyed for all times at the end of WW..."
32102,The Shiekah technology was already around in SS. So the Shiekah technology was a thing way before the first Zelda.

She says: ""Ich segne dich im Namen der Göttin Hylia. Ob der Held die Meere überquert oder eine Verbindung mit der Vergangenheit eingeht, du mögest stehts an seiner Seite sein.""
Translated: ""I bless you in the name of the Goddess Hylia. Whether the hero crosses the Ocean or makes a link to past you will allways be on his side.""

And you hear her talking in the English version too.

It's in japanese too... https://youtu.be/ivxCRVFHwrM?t=1m17s

So... can you hear it? The English version is the only one where Zelda is way to hard to understand."
48427,Besides the Triforce on Zelda's back of the hand...?
84799,She's talking in the background too. What does she say during this?
171579,Yeah... seems like German and French are the best languages to understand her. It's sad... You would expect such references should be hearable.
