16901,"&gt;  Hyrule Historia states that Link fell in battle against Ganondorf after which the seven sages led by Zelda sealed him away, which would imply that Ruto was awakened by then. My problem with fitting the Zora history in Downfall is that the slate explicitly states she helped the hero defeat Ganon. If the hero failed, wouldn't the slate instead say that she, along with the other sages, ""defeated"" Ganon? 

Him falling in battle wouldn't mean they didn't help him defeat him, just that he died in the process, or so the story goes after 100+ generations.

Basically after 10000 years specific details like ""Liink died like a bitch and the sages cleaned up his mess"" are lost to time, especially with how idolized the concept of the hero is."
