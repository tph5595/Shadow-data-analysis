25215,"It would be impossible to merge timelines. Just one of the many many reasons why:

The mirror of Twilight is broken and gone in the child timeline and still somewhere in the world in adult and downfall timelines. This is just one thing that is impossible to be reconciled. Never mind things like Hyrule was completely flooded and a new Hyrule was founded. Even if it was 10,000 years later and it wasn't flooded anymore I'm pretty sure being under water for a few thousand years in going to have its effect "
25246,"As I said in an above post: It would be impossible to merge timelines. Just one of the many many reasons why:

The mirror of Twilight is broken and gone in the child timeline and still somewhere in the world in adult and downfall timelines. This is just one thing that is impossible to be reconciled. Never mind things like Hyrule was completely flooded and a new Hyrule was founded.

Edit: Aonuma also specifically said it does relate to one of the timelines and it can be figured out by playing the game"
25581,"Arbiters grounds existed before OoT. But even disregarding that, we can't figure this out by looking at names of places. There are names from places that are exclusively in each timeline. 

These names are just fun nods from Nintendo. If we want to take the names seriously then you have to believe that somehow Tingle got an island named after him that stayed for 10,000. This is a guy who lived in Termina in Majoras Mask so that makes no sense or was a fake fairy who didn't really do anything in Wind Waker. Either way it makes no sense 

Edit: Aonuma also specifically said it does relate to one of the timelines and it can be figured out by playing the game"
25668,Aunoma specifically said it does relate to one of the timelines and a player can figure it out by playing the game so yes. It does work somewhere 
26181,"That's a stupid argument, no offence. Please tell me any possible way that convoluted Hyrule time would change the differences of a destroyed mirror or the effects of being underwater for thousands of years or everyone living in a new Hyrule or the Royal family controlling the triforce. 

That's not how time works and that's absolutely not how the Ocarina works "
26617,"Actually the opposite, it's more than 10,000 years after. We know it occurs after Ocarina of Time (it mentions the sages) and since the Shieka weren't building all this tech in OoT it probably was at least 50-100 years if not more AFTER OoT before that 10,000 years "
26702,The sages from OoT were the ones who Ganon sent to the dark realm at the beginning of A Link to the Past 
28762,"The amount of things to have to happen in each timeline is ridiculous. One or two you may be able to say be some insane coincidence. But it is IMPOSSIBLE to reconcile. 

Why would they break the mirror of Twilight in the other timelines? Just for fun?  Or does Twilight Princess happen in every timelime because that makes no sense. And if Link doesn't find Midina in those other timelines then who locks everything back in the twilight realm? So you might say the Twili never came then. So why did the break the mirror?? See that's all the problems for josh one difference and there are hundreds of them

There is a principle of logic and philosophy called Okhams Razor. Basically it states that the theory or idea that needs to assume the least amount of things is probably correct. Or in other words the simplest explanation is one you should assume unless proven otherwise. A combined timeline needs to assume an incredible amount of things. 

I agree there are inconsistencies (personally I think downfall has a solid argument).

""Whose to say it isn't all of them?"" Aonuma. The producer and creator of all the modern Zelda games specifically said that is in ONE timeline and you can figure it out by playing the gameZ "
28804,"Sorry, I've never played Dark Souls. 

I know I know I should. "
28962,"No the mirror cannot be fixed. That was the whole point of the end of Twilight Princess. That Link could never see Midina again. 

Also that is just evidence that it's the Adult timeline not combined. Plus Layanru desert in Skyward Sword also used to be a great sea"
29046,"Is Dark Souls 2, 3 or bloodborn the best place to start? "
30917,"Oh I agree, I think they absolutely care about gameplay, story first. That being said we're not arguing about whether this game doesn't fit in the timeline at all or not. We're arguing whether it's in one of the splits or combined after all the splits. And logical it makes no sense that it is combined.

This is all besides the fact that the producer and creator of the game Aonuma stated that it is in one timeline. "
31126,That's not how time works. The only way you can have the timelines combined is if literally everything is exactly the same in every timeline. If a single person dies or a tree is moved in one timeline those worlds can't be together 
32716,"I'm yeah sure but we do know that if there are multiple timelines that can't be converged. It makes no logical sense.

Because there are direct contradictions. How can the mirror of Twilight both be destroyed and not destroyed at the same time? How can Ganondorf have killed one of the 7 sages but at the same time all 7 were alive, banished by Ganon and saved by Link? It. Is. Not. Possible. "
33436,"You literally didn't reply to my point You could have had much time as you want and a sage can't be dead and alive at the same time. The mirror of Twilight cannot be broken and not broken. 

Please stop just making illogical assumptions and points to fit your view. Look at the evidence. 

The creator of Zelda specifically said it's one timeline. No one needs more evidence than that. If you don't think what he says is Canon then the timeline isn't either so this argument is useless

And if they were just parallel timelines that still wouldn't explain why there were names and places from multiple timelines. They would all have different pasts still. So even if all 3 timelines would go to this exact same point they still wouldn't know information from other timelines "
34416,"Okay you obviously don't understand how time or timelines work at all but okay then. 

I take that as pretty obvious evidence for the downfall timeline but each to his own "
39503,"It is not possible the something to exist and not exist at the same time. Logical contradiction. This when you have things like sages dying, Hyrule being flooded and the mirror of Twilight being broken cannot both exist and not exist at the same time 

You can't just make stuff up"
41006,"General rules of physics and science still exist in Hyrule. 

You can't just throw out rules just because they don't work with your theory"
48443,"Uhh no. There are fantastical elements to stories and then there are things that are similar to our world. If every video game developer or fantasy author had to tell the audience about his new laws of physics and time, etc. It would be horrible. 

Generally what fantasy does it keeps all the natural laws of our world and then changes little things like having magic or new species or whatever. That doesn't mean you can just pretend that no natural laws exist. 

We know time exists and we know it can be manipulated through the Ocarina (and master sword) but that doesn't mean we can just say ""oh fuck it. It's a fantasy game who cares about time! All the games might as well just have happened at the same time! Or they are all happening before and after each other!!""

Especially if you're thinking about a timeline you have to use our laws of nature or else there is no point "
48816,"And that would be perfectly fine if Nintendo decided to do something like that. But it can't just be fans contradicting the known laws of the game just to fit their theory. 

If Nintendo wants to come out and do something like that. I'm all game "
48973,Fair enough. But I still think there's enough evidence for the downfall timeline that we shouldn't have to jump to Nintendo coming up with an in game time warp that makes everything work
