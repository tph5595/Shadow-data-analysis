30081,"I agree that a convergence of the timelines is more plausible, for a while I said that Hyrule dilapidated state could reference the oceans draining out in Wind Waker which delegitimizes the events of the two following DS games. Mind you if Hyrule Warriors is canon then we don't even have to think and just blame. I won't add onto this till Nintendo firmly says what goes with what."
30205,Or what if the events of some Zelda games are canonically changed by Nintendo... Hyrule does not have to be flooded for a thousand years... Either Link fails in Wind Waker or the Deku Trees silly side quest to drain the ocean actually follows through
