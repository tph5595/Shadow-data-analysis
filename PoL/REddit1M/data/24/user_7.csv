27362,"10,000 years is am absurdly long time. There's absolutely nothing that says the mirror of twilight couldn't have been broken in the other timelines at some point in the future. The flooding is an obvious arguement, but just to play devil's advocate here it didn't look like natural flooding in the first place. When you'reâ€‹ underwater in the wind waker, Hyrule looks relatively untouched by the absurd flooding, so who is to say that it would be untouched once it unfloods?

I'm not saying it is what happened, I'm just saying there are a LOAD of inconsistencies in BoTW. There's valid references to almost every single timeline which means it could be any of the timelines, so who is to say it isn't all of them? Time split in the first place, what's to stop it from correcting itself eventually?"
49478,"There's also the Quantum Universe theory that says everything that can happen will happen over the infinite universes, and since we're playing a video game and not real life, it's real easy to follow the universes where they do reconcile.

As for reasons why, maybe there is not reason, maybe it just deteriorated. Wind Waker shows us that enchanted items can lose their enchantments if not renewed. It's easily possible for the mirror to lose its enchantment and get worn away from the desert wind over 10,000 years

That quote is literally Aonuma saying it could be all of them, so I'm not really sure what you're trying to say with that"
