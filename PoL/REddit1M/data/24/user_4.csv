8307,The events of ocarina of time exist through all timelines as the kick-off point for the timeline split.
8583,"One thing I think people are over-looking is the fact that the hero of time is never recognized as a hero in the child timeline, his history and the events that occur in OOT are forgotten as they never really happened, isn't that what caused the whole ""hero's shade"" in twilight princess? A sort of hope that his descendant would be recognized as a hero, in the way the hero of time never was?"
41295,"it's a bit strange i'll concede, but i'm fairly certain that the little box of information on the hero's shade specifically states that the hero's shade Is the hero's shade that died ""lamenting that he was never remembered as a hero, and that he never got to pass down his skills to the next generation"" and as an act to ease these regrets he opts to teach the hero of twilight beyond death. It may not make a ton of sense but it is what happens canonically"
