31820,"1. Nobody knows how time works exactly

2. Says who? All you have to establish for the timelines to converge is that enough time has passed in each timeline and certain events occurred such that, at some point in time, the world in each time line is similar enough so as to be indistinguishable. Then you can move forward on one timeline"
32932,"Sure it is. If enough time has passed to where all the previous stories are relegated to myths and legends, and the world is functionally identical across all timelines, then practically speaking the timelines are merged. 

Or you have multiple timelines moving forward, identically, in parallel, which achieves the same result.

34301,"I didn't respond to that point because it was irrelevant. So what if there were differences in a person being alive at one point in the distant past? Same with an object being broken. It's at least 10,000 years later, all of those people are dead, all of those objects can be broken or otherwise lost.

Here's the Aonuma quote you keep referencing:

&gt; I wouldn’t say that it obviously fits into any one part of the timeline, but if you play the game, you’ll be able to work out where it fits. As you probably saw in the trailer, the most recent trailer, there’s a woman’s voice, and she says: “The history of the royal family of Hyrule is also the history of the Calamity Ganon.” And as you know, the Zelda series, up until now, is a history of repeated attacks by Ganon. So, there’s food for thought there. I don’t want to say anything more as I’d like players to work it out for themselves, to play the game and see what they think.

So no, he doesn't say it's one specific timeline. I'd actually interpret that as supporting the merger theory."
34766,"Lol you brought it back around to the entire reason I responded in the first place. 

Nobody knows how time works. You don't, I don't. To vehemently argue with every possible theory about time is asinine because nobody knows.
