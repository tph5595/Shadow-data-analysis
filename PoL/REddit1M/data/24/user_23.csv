25042,Three of the Divine Beasts are named after characters in Ocarina of Time. One of them after a character in Wind Waker. Nabooru is even mentioned by name with regards to that. Also the Great Plateau is where Hyrule Castle was in OoT so the ranch is in a wildly different place anyway along with everything else.
