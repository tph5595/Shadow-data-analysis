48610,"Are you in any way familiar with [Dragon Breaks](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Break) from the Elder Scrolls? One literally ripped 1008 years out of history so that even the Elder Scrolls themselves, books that contain literally all of existence could not show you them. The only surviving accounts speak of strange and contradicting occurrences that makes the flooding of Hyrule look like the ordinary. By inventing the dragon break, bethesda systematically made every one of the eight endings to the second Elder Scrolls game canon in the same universe."
