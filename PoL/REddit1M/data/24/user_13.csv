21024,"One theory I've been considering in regards to that cutscene is that the prophecies of the Hero were established early on, before the timelines split.

As part of the formation of those prophecies, the branching of the timelines was taken into account (potentially alongside other unknown factors), such that only a selection of the prophecies will ever be seen to occur - they are less a case of ""this will happen exactly"" and more ""when these conditions are met, it will result in a scenario which will be resolved by an incarnation of the Hero in this manner"".

Still prophetic to a degree, but taking into account all of the potential outcomes instead of knowing exactly what will happen (which is difficult to pull of if someone who knows the prophecy manages to change things). Not to mention this would allow the inhabitants of one timeline to learn elements of the other timelines by examining the prophecies which never occurred (or have yet to occur - perhaps the same prophecy could be carried out at different points in two separate timelines)."
