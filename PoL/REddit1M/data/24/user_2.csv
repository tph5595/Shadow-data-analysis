5660,"I'd say Arbiter's Grounds was most likely there before the split. Ganondorf was taken there for execution after the events of OoT in the CT and I'm pretty sure they didn't build it just for him. It's stated to have been used as a prison before all that. 

I'm not saying you're wrong, I just don't think it's as strong a piece of evidence as you make it out to be. I'd say the fact that Ruto had previously awakened as a sage and fought Ganondorf (according to the Zora history slate) is a stronger piece of evidence **against** CT than Arbiter's Grounds is for. I'm not buying that it referred to an event separate from OoT.

(I'm loving this BotW timeline placement ambiguity by the way. Being able to make theories again is so much fun! :D)"
10027,"Fitting BotW into any timeline is problematic.

Regarding assumptions with the Downfall timeline, Hyrule Historia states that Link fell in battle against Ganondorf after which the seven sages led by Zelda sealed him away, which would imply that Ruto was awakened by then. My problem with fitting the Zora history in Downfall is that the slate explicitly states she helped the hero defeat Ganon. If the hero failed, wouldn't the slate instead say that she, along with the other sages, ""defeated"" Ganon? 

The Adult Timeline seems pretty unlikely with the information we have at the moment. I mean, there are clear references to it, but nothing really decisive. Koroks, Rito, Rock Salt and Vah Medoh are nice pieces of evidence but they don't stand on their own. There's too much left unexplained, if this is the intended place.

You do have a point with the Child Timeline comment. Then again, the Four Sword ceases to exist when the devs don't need it for the gameplay. :P

BotW just... doesn't fit. I hope the story DLC at the end of the year adds a bit of history that would make this easier."
13963,I think that's a theory. Do you have a source to back it up?
17876,"I was thinking more like they wouldn't even have mentioned him later since he didn't do the defeating-part, but what you're saying makes perfect sense."
