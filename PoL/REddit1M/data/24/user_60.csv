9193863,"I actually agree with this... I think Nintendo realizes it's fans care about the backgrounds, histories, and legends behind it's stories. Hyrule Historia was more than likely their best attempt to take what people had theorized, assemble it however it best fits, and make it officially canon. With the Switch out, it's likely the 3DS/2DS only has a short time left. I think once they can make a cost reduced switch (maybe a smaller screen, integrated controls, optional dock and external controllers), then they'll almost certainly retire the 3DS line.

With only one console/handheld device to worry with, the Windwaker/Other split seen between consoles and handhelds hold little remaining justification to exist. Put simply...

Nintendo will want to simplify the timeline, so they can move forward with new stories and new concepts, without worrying about where it fits. Choosing to set BotW over 10000 years passed ANY prior events in the series also vastly separates it from any past game, giving them plenty of time to justify the world changing.

Now, in regards to whether the timelines have merged... We can currently confirm the references to *all timelines* in a cutscene, during the first memory, ""Subdued Ceremony""... We hear Zelda vocally giving references to multiple timelines. The end of Zelda's speech is talked over by the Champions, but we can hear in the English version, she says:

""Hero of Hyrule, chosen by the sword that seals the darkness. You have shown unflinching bravery and skill in the face of darkness and adversity, and have proven yourself worthy of the blessings of the Goddess Hylia. Whether **skyward bound, adrift in time, or steeped in the glowing embers of twilight,** the sacred blade is forever bound to the soul of the hero. We pray for your protection, and we hope that…that the two of you will grow stronger together as one.""

As I said, there is an additional portion of her speech where she is talked over by the Champions. It's not easy to hear what she is saying, and I know I can't exactly make it out. As the OP stated however, for whatever reasons, be they script variation, linguistic differences, etc... Some foreign language versions reference even more... Specifically, the French, German, and Japanese versions all appear to reference ""seas and golden power"".

In the French version, we see:
*""Par delà les mers...""* and *""Dans sa quête du pouvoir d'or forgé par les dieux..."",* Which apparently means: ""Beyond the **seas**..."" and ""In his quest for the **golden power forged by the gods**...""

In German we get:
*""Ob der Held die Meere überquert oder eine Verbindung mit der Vergangenheit eingeht, du mögest stets an seiner Seite sein.""* 
Which apparently means: ""Whether the hero **crosses the sea,** or creates **a link to the past,** may you always be at his side.""

That's *PRETTY SOLID EVIDENCE,* if you ask me! I have also heard that the Japanese version refers to both **""seas""** and to **""Triforce of the gods""**, which is the Japanese name for ""A Link to the Past"". I can't say how accurate this is, cause I've not heard it myself.

What it tells me, is that there MUST have been not only a timeline split in the distant past, thanks to the events of Ocarina of Time (which is canon, of course), but some time 10000 years prior, something had to have merged the timelines. Furthermore, I think this actually kinda makes sense. The Windwaker timeline sees the development of technology. Steam boats and trains and such... It's a fair assumption that as the world rebuilds, technology might become a staple for the population. If the Sheika develop the ""blue flame"" and initially power bigger and better steam devices, and eventually the computer like devices such as the Sheika Slate, the Distillation Pedestals, etc... It just seems like a natural progression, in a world where magic still exists, but technology rules supreme. Other timelines don't have those levels of technology, and if a merger occurs, that could be the element of distrust of an unknown that forces the Sheika to abandon tech, or be banished, thus creating the Sheika - Yiga split.

It's all speculation, what truly happened 10000 years in the past... All we have is some cutscenes telling the story of how a technologically advanced Hyrule put down the Calamity Ganon threat for a *SOLID TEN MILLENNIA!* I mean, come on... That's darn impressive... Thing is... We just see a weaved blanket rug thing... We are told what happened as a story, but we don't *see* what happened. I highly suspect Nintendo's next Zelda game will probably focus on the events of 10000 years ago. Why? Well, we know Link and company wins... BotW is proof that Ganon got put down for a LONG time. A losing game doesn't make for a great primary title, but DLC covering the fall that leads up to the events of BotW... Yeah, that's totally fine for a DLC. Point about going 10100 years into the past, is that Nintendo can reuse assets from BotW, making programming and development far easier. Shrines, landscapes, Guardians, Divine Beasts... These are all in game assets that can all be reused, but retextured to look all shiny and ~~chrome~~ new. :D

The big question, is how does Hyrule create the Divine Beasts? The Guardians? How does it gain such a technological superiority? Is it the Windwaker Hyrule that develops this new tech? Do they see other timelines in need and try to cross or merge the timelines to render aid? Does another timeline find a way to draw the other timelines together into it, in a bid to survive an utterly impossible onslaught? Imagine going up against Calamity Ganon at the pack of his power, with no Divine Beasts, no Guardians, no Rune powers, and none of the Shrine challenges to build up one's skills... 10100 years ago, it might have been too daunting a task to face.

It's also been pointed out, that Zelda is shown with the FULL Triforce glowing on her hand... Not just the Triforce of Wisdom. This tells me that a timeline where the Triforce is whole could be the source of both Calamity Ganon **and** the merger... What if a member of the royal family (or anyone that fits the story) sought the power of the whole Triforce to come up with a solution to beat Calamity Ganon... What if the solution, empowered by the Triforce, is to unite three separate Hyrules into one, so the combined forces and skills of each timeline can converge on a battle to seal the Calamity. The Triforce is most likely the key to a simple merging of the timelines. A Zelda game set in this period would not only be easy for Nintendo to create, thanks to numerous reused resources, but coming up with it as a prequel to BotW sets the stage. We get an idea of what's supposed to happen, but we don't know how. I'd commend Nintendo if they pull it off!

Anyway... just mental wanderings... Pure speculation on what might come for the next Zelda game. Still, there is definitely solid evidence that all timelines are, if not flat out merged, then at the very least known of by Hyrule's past rulers. They'd have to have also been traversable, from one timeline to another, for both stories and artifacts to cross timelines. I'm more inclined to believe in a merger.﻿"
