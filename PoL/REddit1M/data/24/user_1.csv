2056,"Without taking sides on which timeline is the better choice (because I still don't know for sure what the deal is), even if you take into account translation error or other existing references, and remove that as evidence, there still exists an area within the Gerudo Desert called the Arbiter's Grounds within Breath of the Wild. The only other time this area was shown was within Twilight Princess, within the Child timeline.

While I'm, again, still unsure of where this will ultimately fall, I feel as though that's one of the stronger pieces of evidence for Child: a physical location appearing in a Child timeline game is within Breath of the Wild. Whether or not it's just another named reference is hard to say, considering the sheer number of named references through the game. Still, it does seem feasible that the Grounds from Twilight Princess could have been covered in sand over the previous 10k+ years."
3276,"While I agree that's likely completely true, it's hard to take evidence of a place existing pre-split when we've never heard of or seen it pre-split. Otherwise, I wouldn't have even brought up the Grounds to begin with.

I also did account for the other existing references across the various split timelines. Considering most of those locations have no physical similarity or placement to any previous counterpart of the same name, it's currently too difficult to place BotW into a specific timeline based on that alone. Still, certain things CAN be ruled out via physical similarity (that is, the likes of Linebeck Island, or Lulu Lake, can't be compared in *exactly* the same way as the Arbiter's Grounds can; those types of named locations refer to people, some of which have had no previous crossover, or shouldn't really exist at all in the case of some Majora's Mask references; conversely, the Arbiter's Grounds was first seen as a physical location, and is still a physical location, located in the same general area as it was previously seen). On that note, just to show I'm not vouching for one side or another, merely putting information out there, the Lost Woods' placement here is more like that of ALttP than OoT, making that a stronger piece for the Downfall timeline.

Still, I'm not claiming that the Grounds is the smoking gun the Child timeline needed to come out on top. I'm just saying that it's a stronger piece of evidence for that timeline, considering it's a physical location we've previously only seen within the Child timeline. The same way that certain other physical aspects of BotW's world correlate with places from the other two splits (well, mostly Downfall, in that regard; Adult timeline seems like the least likely candidate at this point).

Ultimately, for the time being, unless we find some conclusive piece of evidence for one side or another, we're at a point where everything we find contradicts the next thing we find."
7329,"I agree that it was likely somewhere we never visited in OoT. It's just difficult to use that potential as evidence, when that potential has little true evidence to back itself up. Likely? Definitely. But still something we can't concretely prove without some level of assumption.

For what it's worth, I was mostly referring to the Arbiter's Grounds being strong in comparison to other named locations. A lot of those other places are named after a person as a reference or tribute or something similar, whereas the Grounds were a previously-named area that we know existed in a specific timeline. That evidence just makes it easier to place. It's obviously got flaws, as you pointed out with the Ruto history (also, thank you for not immediately saying the slates were evidence for Downfall; while I'm not against any timeline for now, that's another assumption of how Link's failure went that I'm seeing that's kind of driving me crazy), but it is still a piece for people to use in their theory-crafting.

I'm loving the ambiguity, to a point. The discussion on timelines is awesome again, but it would be less frustrating with a little bit more to go on. As it stands, the majority of concrete info we can find from past games seems to be from pre-split titles (namely, Skyward Sword). It would be nice to have more to discuss on the timeline with something a little more relevant.

Although... is it possible for most to agree that this is likely NOT placed in the Adult timeline? Considering the last we saw of the Master Sword was at the bottom of an ocean... without any explanation of how that changed, I find it hard to believe that detail would just be glossed over.

Then... couldn't the same be said for the Child timeline? The last we see Ganon, he's sealed away in the Four Sword, at the end of Adventures. It would be kind of odd to find out he's busted out in BotW, regardless of how long ago, with absolutely zero mention of his breaking free of another sword.

Hmm... just thoughts popping into my head at 6am. (I'm sleeping now. Good lord, where did the time go? XD)"
36376,"It's not much to look at, but it's in the southern end of the Gerudo Desert. It's where one of the four Molduga fights are located, so if you end up fighting a Molduga south of Gerudo Town, check the name of the area it's sitting in."
42111,"Like I said: not much to look at. Considering how much of the BotW Gerudo ruins seem to be covered in sand, it's possible things have been covered up over the past 10k+ years. I can't say it's the obvious solution, but, it's there, as a physical location we've been to before.

Of course, all the named locations could just be references in their entirety, but it seems odd that we'd have any names of locations crossing over if we weren't meant to notice that in some capacity."
