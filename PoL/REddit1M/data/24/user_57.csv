79176,"I think you're taking the whole thing a bit to seriously. I think they decided to make this 10,000 years after the great calamity so it was distant enough in the future for it to fall into any timeline. As for the whole ""real world physics apply"" thing that's simply your opinion. It's a video game where you have teleportation technology and talking dragon boats, It's the writers decision whether or not their work of fiction is realistic or not and if they decide to do something that breaks continuity then that's their creative right to do do. The timeline is and most likely always will be a mess since it was never intended to be examined this closely. Just take the games for what they are and enjoy them."
