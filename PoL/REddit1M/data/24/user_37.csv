36496,"&gt; Except for the fact that the spirit of the hero and the descendent of Hylia have left Hyrule, the Triforce, and Ganon behind.

&gt; The adult timeline is impossible.

What's so hard about ""they came back later""? 

We would have to assume that original Hyrule was restored at some point (maybe the Sheikah did it when they were burying all those shrines) but I don't see why the adult timeline is impossible."
97489,"&gt; Because we have absolutely zero evidence suggesting that this may have happened.

The Rito and Koroks are evidence, because those only exist in one timeline. You can claim there are alternate explanations, but there's not ""zero evidence"" -- in fact, I would say that the presence of two entire species is more evidence than an offhanded remark about twilight by Zelda.

&gt; All other explanations for the Rito, Koroks, rock salt, and other adult timeline references are more plausible than this.

I don't see how an explanation for concurrent evolution of the Rito without the environmental change of the Great Sea is any more plausible than the series returning to original Hyrule. *All* of the timelines have holes that need to be filled to fit BotW. 

I would say that on its face, the most direct and obvious evidence we have points towards the adult timeline. If you want to rule it out, you either need conclusive evidence against that theory or stronger evidence for a different one. I haven't seen either."
112477,"Well, you're responding to me with a bunch of arguments that I haven't made, so if you're not going to take the time to address me directly then I'm not really going to waste my own time diving into this. But I do want to touch on one point here:

&gt; Proposing a ""retcon"" to force your theory to fit is pretty solid evidence that you are choosing to only see what you want to see. You're twisting the lore to fit in the way that you have decided it should fit, instead of looking at all of the evidence with an unbiased mind.

I would argue that this is exactly what *you* are doing with your ""the Rito/Koroks evolved in the other timelines too"" argument. You're ignoring and hand-waving away the evidence that doesn't support your theory, while coming up with equally-wild explanations for the things that you like and treating them as fact.

The arguments against the downfall/child timelines are just as strong, if not stronger, than the argument against the adult timeline.

* Downfall: The Master Sword is explicitly said to have slept ""FOREVER"" after the events of Link to the Past. And indeed, it doesn't show up in any of the subsequent games in that timeline. This is a minor detail that could be easily retconned, but as you said above, we're not accepting retcons here. This is at least as strong as your ""no one ever returned to Old Hyrule"" argument -- probably stronger, because this was directly stated in-game, as opposed to your conjecture about what the characters did or didn't do after Phantom Hourglass/Spirit Tracks. 

* Child: The Zora's well-kept history specifically chronicles the events of the Adult/Downfall timeline, in which Ruto was awakened as a sage and fought with Link against Ganon. The child timeline is the only place where this *didn't* happen, which pretty clearly rules it out as a candidate. Your theory of ""Oh, maybe Link told them about it and they wrote it down in their history"" is pretty weak and is just as unsupported by the official events of the game as any of the other suggestions.

The truth is that BotW mixes elements from *all* of the timelines, and fitting it into any one of them is going to require some logical leaps. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if the official answer is that this game represents a [Dragon Break](http://elderscrolls.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Break)-style event where the timelines have been rejoined/reset in some way."
184308,"So here's a serious question that I don't know the answer to. If I'm wrong, I'll shut up about this.

Can you provide a **canon** source explicitly stating that the Zora went *extinct* during Wind Waker? Laruto definitely says that Medli is her descendant, but that alone doesn't prove that the Zora died out, just that some of them evolved into Rito. (And as I said before, evolution does not mean that the previous group ceases to exist.) 

It's been a while since I've played Wind Waker, and I never finished Phantom Hourglass so it's possible that this is definitively stated somewhere in the games, or maybe even in an instruction manual or something. But I don't remember ever seeing it: the Zora were just not around in Wind Waker. (I searched [Wind Waker's script](https://www.gamefaqs.com/gamecube/469050-the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker/faqs/23534?print=1) and couldn't find anything that supports their extinction or really talks about them at all.)

If there's proof that the Zora actually went extinct after the flooding of Hyrule, then I'll accept that the adult timeline placement is unlikely. But if their extinction is not directly canon, then their presence in BotW doesn't require a retcon and I maintain that it's the most obvious explanation of where the game fits into the timeline. "
216955,"&gt; Meanwhile, in BotW, we see that the Rito evolved alongside the Zora. This evolutionary path contradicts the one we saw in Wind Waker - as the Zora should no longer exist in the Adult Timeline.

We didn't *see* their evolutionary path in Wind Waker. All we saw was a race of birds that descended from the Zora, and no actual Zora hanging around the islands. Most people, including myself, assumed that this meant the original Zora had died out, but that's not backed up by anything in the game. The statement ""the Zora should no longer exist in the Adult Timeline"" is complete conjecture.

&gt; But if your concept of proof is direct textual statements as opposed to ""beyond a reasonable doubt"", then you don't have any ""proof"" for any of the things that you claim are evidence of the Adult Timeline anyway.
This concrete definition of ""proof"" makes just about any BotW timeline placement impossible.

No question. Any timeline placement requires some assumptions about stuff that we don't directly see in the game.

But since the Zora's assumed extinction in Wind Waker seems like it may have been made up by fans rather than being actual canon, my point is that placing BotW in that timeline is the most obvious solution. The explanation and handwaving required to justify the Rito and Koroks existing in any other timeline (among other issues) is far greater than simply assuming that there were still some Zora living underwater in Wind Waker, we just never met them. "
219321,"&gt; How did we get from ""not directly stated in-game"" to ""made up by fans""?

Is there some third option I'm missing? I guess ""stated by the developers"" could count as canon too, but as far as I know they haven't made any more concrete statements on this subject than what's already in the game.

&gt; Speaking of ""handwaving""...
&gt; We didn't see their evolutionary path in Wind Waker. All we saw was a race of birds that descended from the Zora, and no actual Zora hanging around the islands

I don't get your point here. I'm not handwaving anything; I'm re-evaluating the evidence we have against the assumptions that people have made. The absence of Zora on the islands Link visited is not proof of their extinction. (And if the only reason they evolved into Rito was because they couldn't survive in the Great Sea, they why on earth would they evolve in a timeline where the Great Sea doesn't even exist?)

&gt; Do you honestly find it more likely that Link, Zelda, and the Royal Family decided to leave New Hyrule, old Hyrule became un-flooded, everyone decided to go back to old Hyrule, and they were actually able to find old Hyrule?

*Yes.* I don't find any of those things to be problematic at all.

Why would anyone decide to go looking for old Hyrule? Well, it happens to be the last known resting place of the Triforce: the ultimate power of the gods that has the ability to reshape reality itself according to the whims of its owner. I can see why that would be a slight incentive to go looking for it. Given that it's the centerpiece of the entire series, I find it more unlikely that people *wouldn't* eventually go looking for the Triforce and just forget about it forever.

I also don't understand why you keep saying that finding old Hyrule would be a challenge at all. First, I might be forgetting something from the end of Wind Waker or from PH/ST, but from what I remember it was just Link, Tetra, and the pirates that left Old Hyrule in search of a new kingdom. Obviously other people had made the trek by the time of Spirit Tracks, but is it stated that *absolutely everyone* left the islands of the Great Sea? I assumed there were still people living on Dragon Roost, Windfall, etc. And even if you assume that no one stayed, and even if you assume that they kept zero record of where they used to live, they could *still* just sail around the general area until they spotted a [giant mountain](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Roost_Island) or a [tower sticking out of the sea](http://zelda.wikia.com/wiki/Tower_of_the_Gods). Someone's going to stumble on it eventually. 

&gt; Do you see how your perception of what is ""likely"" is being colored by the timeline placement that you have already decided that you want to believe?

You're just as guilty of that as me. "
223291,"Look, we can go around in circles on this forever. The whole Old Hyrule/New Hyrule thing is not even slightly concerning to me, and I'll explain why.

When I look at the issue of Breath of the Wild and the timeline, the question I ask myself is: ""How can we place this game in the timeline without contradicting anything in existing canon?""

The Rito issue is the #1 thing that immediately rules out the Downfall/Child timelines for me. It is 100% canon that the Rito evolved as a response to the flooding of Hyrule. That only happened in one timeline, so by canon, the Rito only exist in that timeline. Therefore any game that includes the Rito must take place there. There are some other minor things that also factor in, like the Ruto/Zora history issue that we discussed before, but the Rito are the biggest one to me.

Does placing BotW after Wind Waker require some additional unexplained events to have taken place? Of course. *Any* timeline placement will require this. There's a ton we don't know about how Ganon lost his physical form, how and when the Sheikah invented all of these contraptions to fight Ganon and buried them all over the world, and so on. We don't have anything close to the full story here.

So when we start talking about how a post-WW placement requires some extra events to happen that we don't know about, that's just one more for the pile in my eyes. You're talking about how hard it would be to find a specific point in the ocean as though we were actually going to get in a boat and go do it, while ignoring the fact that Hyrule is a world of magic and faeries and goddesses and destiny. I can think of a million and one ways to write a ""missing link"" game (pardon the pun) where Zelda/Link return to Old Hyrule in search of the Triforce. Maybe it calls to them, as we've seen before, or maybe they intentionally seek it out to resolve some calamity, or maybe someone just stumbles across it randomly, as tends to happen in stories.

Is it all made up? Absolutely. But the important part for me is that **none of it contradicts existing canon**, it's just some creative filling of the gaps that need to be filled anyway. I think that's the key difference between our methods: I am happy to make up an entire game's worth of events in my head in order to resolve the apparent contradictions in canon, as long as it fits all of the established facts.

It sounds like your preferred approach is to figure out the placement that requires the least amount of additional explanation, even if it slightly contradicts stuff we already know. And that's fine too. If you prefer to think that some alternate event in the other timelines prompted parallel evolution of the Rito without the flooding of Hyrule, more power to you. We don't have enough information to prove either interpretation, and we won't be able to answer the question definitively until/unless the devs comment on the issue or release another game that gives us more information.
