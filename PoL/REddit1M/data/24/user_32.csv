Koroks exist, Rito exist, and Rock Salt talks about how it's from the ancient sea... It's pretty clear this is the Adult Timeline."
54526,"Koroks + Rito say you're wrong, why are you saying the spirit ""left"" them behind!? Zelda clearly uses the Tri-Force in the end.

You're proof is --- Where?"
54738,"Hyrule wasn't ""destroyed for all times"" lol. It was flooded, instead of being preserved under the sea. You realize it's possible the ocean dried up, and the land underneath re-inhabited? If that happened yeah, a lot of culture would be lost, which is probably why the ""myth"" of the hero, goddess, and ganon has become largely believed to be just that - Myth.

""But the King of Red Lions touches the Triforce first. The King wishes for Hyrule and Ganondorf to be buried beneath the waves of the Great Sea. He also wishes for hope for his descendants; that they might be able to create a better world.[27] The Triforce then vanishes, possibly floating away to the sacred lands to await a new owner.""

-From the wiki

For the love of god stop adding baseless conjecture. Hyrule was obviously flooded at the end, not ""destroyed"""
54923,"If it was cannon it was definitely a garbage addition to the series in terms of plot, gameplay, and characterizations."
55131,"It's clear the Tri-Force is whole on Zelda's hand. Rather than a highlighted bottom left piece that she typically has. This indicates that the Tri-Force is no longer split at this point. Ganon himself doesn't even seem to want the Tri-Force of Power in this one, rather he is powered by the ancient evil of Demise"
58064,"No, no, no. See you're assuming that new Hyrule just stayed new, with an entirely different end villain, and everything. It's entirely possible Ganon could reincarnate, and the general map of ""New Hyrule"" is rather small... If say the Great Sea dried up however... We'd have what is the largest Hyrule yet. Stating that they are in New Hyrule now and forever is assuming a lot. It's fully possible New Hyrule simply got bigger as the sea dried up, and return of Ganon occurred, as it is destined to do time and again.

You want proof? Look at this Hyrule... You see how insanely Mountainous it is? Have you noticed how many large peaks exist? Hmmm.... It's highly likely the flat land was once covered in Ocean. "
59821,"Not really. New Hyrule is far smaller than old Hyrule, and it doesn't even take place that far into the timeline. Zelda is Tetra's Great, Great Granddaughter, and Link seems to have no relation with the hero of wind. We can pretty much assume Spirit Tracks only takes place a few hundrend years after Phantom Hourglass. 

BotW takes place over 10,000 years from the last Ganon attack which took place who knows how many years after Spirit Tracks... that's a lot of time for stuff to change. You can't forget the giant time block that forces us to make some assumptions. This is why looking at what is physically presented to us shows far more about this games timeline placment than trying to fill in the blanks. Evidence says the world was once flooded in salt water (rock salt deposits EVERYwhere, and a LOT of mountains indicate erosion) Rito being a race as well as the Koroks also point to it taking place in the Adult Timeline. To add to that, the Rito seemingly never left the Great Sea above Old Hyrule. They aren't anywhere to be seen in Phantom, or Spirit Tracks. I am simply using the evidence shown in the game."
