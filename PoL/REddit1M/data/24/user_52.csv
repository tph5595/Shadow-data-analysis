Demons Souls"

I think at a bare minimum we can say that it's explicitly tied to OoT, but honestly I think Nintendo are happy to keep making ""sequels"" to that game.

I mean... Majoras Mask, Wind Waker, Twilight Princess, and now this all follow from OoT.  I don't blame them for making that the centerpiece of their references."

Nothing else has specific events, locations, or characters accurately depicted like OoT. Lon Lon Ranch is demonstrably the same place, for example."
