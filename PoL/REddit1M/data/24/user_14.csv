22117,"Well Koroks were said to be closer to the original form of the Kokiri in Wind Waker and since the Kokiri existed before the timeline split its reasonable that they could be in any of them. The Rito are an interesting conundrum on their own, and my current theory is that they evolved from the friendly zora and the Zora in breath of the wild are descendants of the River Zora which explains their more feral appearance."
