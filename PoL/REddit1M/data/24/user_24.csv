25150,"Do I really need to restate the obvious connections Zelda games have had to eachother? 

Zelda 2 is a clear sequel to Zelda 1. 
Majora's Mask is a clear sequel to Ocarina of Time. 
Ocarina of Time is a clear prequel to A Link to the Past.
Skyward Sword is a clear prequel to the rest of the series. 
The Minish Cap is a clear prequel to 4Swords. 
The Wind Waker and Twilight Princess are clear sequels to Ocarina of Time. 
A Link Between Worlds is a clear sequel to A Link to the Past. 
Phantom Hourglass is a clear sequel to Wind Waker.

Yes there are convoluted connections, Minish Cap being a sequel to Skyward Sword being one of them, but to say there's NEVER been a timeline is factually wrong."
27304,The intro of A Link to the Past states that 7 wise men (later changed to sages in the GBA port to cement the connection) sealed Ganon.  This backstory was detailing the events of Ocarina of Time.
28078,"And that's where the convolutedness of the timeline rears it's head. While it would be easy to say that, since each game that is connected to another game usually states that the games that occur in the past eventually turn to legend, because Ocarina of Time's events turned to legend the people telling that legend misconstrued it as a war.

Zelda now tends  to make the legitimacy of these legends as historical fact.

That's what happened when they had to split the timeline into three continuities and now instead of detailing Ocarina of Time's events, A Link to the Past now details a war that occurred AFTER Ocarina of Time that was never shown before.

It's the one flaw of the timeline I actually have a big issue with, turning what makes sense as historical events being misconstrued into larger than life legends into historical fact."
29475,"I've never seen the timeline as something that MUST be adhered to. Just something that provides some solid links to other games for fans to enjoy if they want to.

Example, imagine if the Temple of Time in Twilight Princess or Breath of the Wild WASN'T the same one as in Ocarina of Time. It'd lose some of the impact of seeing it in ruins as opposed to it being just some random temple with the same name."
