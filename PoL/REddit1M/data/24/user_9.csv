This is like a reboot that Nintendo can now use as their base to include all the pieces from the past games and make sense."

28805,Not a bad way at all to merge everything together at all!
30758,"There are a couple mentions of the Twilight timeline, I believe.

The mirror probably cannot be fixed, but that still doesn't mean that the timeline doesn't exist.  It just means the Twilight realm cannot be reached."
33937,"&gt; The only way you can have the timelines combined is if literally everything is exactly the same in every timeline.

If everything is exactly the same, then there would be one?  There are multiple timelines which many different events happened.  I'm saying an cataclysmic event happened that brought all of these events together.  

We're getting off the beaten path here.  "
34300,"I don't disagree that the developers aimed (and succeeded in many ways) to make the very best game first. 

However, they (Nintendo) did reconcile all of the previous games and made a story.  This game takes story elements from all of the past games.  In a way, the past games are now legends told from different perspectives.  

&gt;Nintendo creates the game that they want to create, without much thought to what fans think they want. 

I agree but this also implies Nintendo had no intention of giving us a unified story which they absolutely did when the came out with the LoZ timeline.

9256194,"Several great points you included.  

I have to assume Nintendo's main goal was to find a palatable means to include all their characters.  As you mentioned, Hyrule Historia basically shows they at the very least are trying to make a cohesive storyline.  As any legend, there could be parts that don't make sense.

I'm interested to see where they go next.  "
