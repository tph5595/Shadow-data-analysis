45967,"This is called a Dragon Break- it's an idea that, as far as I'm aware, began in the Elder Scrolls (at least, that's where the phrase comes from).  What it means is that every possibility happens and then all the resulting timelines jam back together in a way that makes them all ""canon"".  In TES the most famous Dragon Break is the ""warp in the west"".  In Daggerfall the player could choose to give one of several factions control of a giant God-robot called the Numidium.  Depending on who got the Numidium, there would be a different outcome.  But in Morrowind it turns out that all of these factions got the Numidium, because time fixed itself so that every possibility was canon.  This meant that there were reports of the Numidium appearing in several places at once.

Basically, this could be a similar idea.  Hyrule got flooded when no hero came to stop Ganondorf, but at the same time Ganondorf was safely locked away in Arbiter's Grounds *and* Ganondorf was defeated by the sages when he defeated the hero.  All three of those things happened, but then those timelines realigned.  So yes, Hyrule was flooded.  It was also *not* flooded.  It just happens that in the resulting aligned timeline it isn't flooded anymore."
