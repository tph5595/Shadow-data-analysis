12312,I thought the Arbiter Grounds we're built to imprison all the gerudo who followed Ganondorf in the war that followed OoT and then was later used to house any prisoners for a while until it was abandoned.
14263,"Nope just memory of it being in the gerudo desert, there's no more gerudo as far as we saw which would also conflict with BotW now that i think about it lol, ganondorf launched a war against hyrule after he couldn't get the triforce, followed by it was used as his execution site and the npc that sends you there says it was used as a prison. just putting 2 and 2 together that it was used to imprison the gerudo who followed ganondorf they would naturally be considered criminals in the aftermath of a war they lost."
