1829,TWO people have voted for it so far... 
4557,"i can never get into that one :(

I've tried, but it's confusing as fuck to me."
21377,"I might be spoiled by the modern linear and easy games, but i have absolutely no idea what to do after the first 15 minutes. "
22001,I havent figured out how to get to the first dungeon.
26795,Right here mate!
36735,"Agreed. I would have to say that my favourite is PH, and that LTTP is the best, but Minish Cap was by far the most *enjoyable* to play. Something about that childish feel -- little guys doing big things, with a freaking hilarious talking hat!"
36793,"Yeah, when you're first discovering all the hidden secrets and stuff. PH will always hold that space in my heart container &lt;3"
36915,"No, I disagree. It was designed for a little weaker hardware and for a much younger target audience. It fixed a lot of the technical issues of PH while being fun to play. It was quite weak on the actual storytelling, and Malladus was excruciatingly difficult for a young player, but the locomotion and panflute were well executed in regards to the overall feel of the game. 

6/10, might do an easy 3 heart challenge. "
36936,Of course.
37067,"I've figured out that much, and even managed to get the bomb mask and the fairy mask. I played up to the deku/monkeys (it's been a while, I don't remember what they were) in the swamp, but I wasn not able to talk to any of the NPCs, so I think I'm doing things incorrectly. "
37149,I'm only 22 and I feel the same way.
37171,Right?? I had to vote multiple times on different IP addresses
37263,Roll a dice between your favourites
37344,You really REALLY **REALLY** need to play some of the other games. I would work backwards from release date.
38125,"I'll set that up
"
38590,Yeah me too. 
38652,It's a fun game -- though not the best of the series. A lot of non-avid transgame zelda players have played only Skyward Sword.
38881,(agreed)
91908,makes me want to play it.
92053,"No, I'm a zelda fan. 

I've been investigating, and my ROM that ive been using for MM is faulty. I cannot talk to NPCs outside of Clock Town, which makes it pretty much impossible to do anything in the swamp, or anywhere..."
92272,"I plan on it, I'm definitely going to start over in the game with a clean slate and a working emulator (Virtual Console finally, woot!). Hopefully I'll have a better experience this time."
92360,"Yeah, me too. Not a lot of GBOY players out there I guess"
92371,I'd vote for all of them if I could.
92416,"Yes, it's on Virtual Console. I bought it yesterday afternoon because of all that is being said in this thread. ^(hey, neat rhyme)"
92466,Minish Cap = over looked
92486,I'll heighten it on my list to play :)
92532,Are the CD-i games worth playing?
92571,Sounds like you enjoy the handhelds!
92640,It turns out the ROM for my emulator was faulty. 
92748,"I'd recommend OOT first, but you'll probably connect more with LTTP"
92766,Yeah I'm with you man
94658,Same here man
94811,"I've always used a GC controller, but your local Gamestop or Walmart should stock them. If not, [you can buy it online](http://www.ebay.com/itm/like/300997672932?lpid=82)"
94888,"I agree, but I want *so badly* to love the game."
101924,"I voted for LTTP... I don't know why, because I've always found PH to be my favourite. But I second guessed myself and ended up voting for LTTP"
