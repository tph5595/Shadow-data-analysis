5700,"It was the rails, for me. Something about them made the game feel too direct and frustrating to navigate. ""Alright, so I need to get over there. I'll have to take this track, then make a right and a left, and avoid those demon trains."" Personally I just didn't find it fun, but I'm not going to argue if you did.

Wind Waker was (again, in my opinion) brilliant. You saw a speck on the horizon, and sailed for it. You got to a new island, charted it, and explored it. Taking out pirate outposts was fun and a nice distraction. It was an adventure. I just didn't get that feeling from Spirit Tracks, or even from Phantom Hourglass."
