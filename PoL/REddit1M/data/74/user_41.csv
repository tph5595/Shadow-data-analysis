It's an awesome game, delivered on the original graphics capabilities teased when the GC was on the horizon, had a beautiful world, great writing (not too serious and not too silly), compelling story, solid mechanics, well rounded interface (on GC, not Wii). Nothing to complain about from my perspective. "

1. To my knowledge, no LoZ world has ever felt in peril. In the first, it's kinda hard to express much impending doom when the only other people you meet are in caves trying to sell you stuff. Zelda 2, a similar struggle of short conversations makes story telling difficult. ALTTP, the man on the mountain seems to be the only one with a vested interest in what's happening with his daughter being taken but other than that, few people are running around screaming ""Ganon is nigh!"" In OoT, there are royalties just sitting around, doing nothing; even when unfrozen, King Zora just gives you some nice threads. MM is the only LoZ where there is a real discussion on what should be done about the moon crashing into the town. WW...well, I only played this one once through so I've little evidence to go on. TP, again, no one is the wiser about the twilight invasion; in fact, the doom is only apparent to them when they are enveloped in the shadows; people are terrified, totally afraid. When I think of a world in peril, I think of people running around with signs saying ""The end is near, repent!"" or finding holes to hide in hoping to wait out the danger. No LoZ has ever had that sinking feeling of ""I better not fuck this up.""

2. Correct me if I'm wrong, but could you not brighten up the screen through the game menu or Gamecube menu? Even you TV aught to have a brightness adjust. Frankly, I think TP has the best graphics of the whole franchise.

3. What would you rather have, a game where you can ONLY hack and slash in simple fashion or a game that allowed you to be as exotic or simple as you liked? Yes, you could use very basic tactics to achieve the end goal, but it's always nice to be able to use more than just a simple sword swipe.

4. I've never seen any other game that pulls off animal movements as well as the wolf mode in TP. If' you're referring to the collection quests to un-shadow places...yes, that was a little...unfun.

5. Yes, there are a few items that are only used in their respective dungeons, but did you not need the hover boots anywhere else besides the Shadow Temple in OoT? The spinner is cool, but limited; ball and chain was kinda fun elsewhere; dominion rod...yeah, those were one hit wonders.

6. I got nothing. I wish LoZs where a bit more difficult in the combat arenas. Not Dark Souls hard, but not brainless.

Again, you've pointed out you're opinions well, instead of just ""dus any1 els haet TP?! Sux balz!!"" I was very disappointed with WW, but it seems %75 of the people here will kill for that game. But like you said, to each his own."
