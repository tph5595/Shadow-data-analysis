I enjoyed it of course, but when I first played Twilight Princess on GC, I was amazed at how different it was. I remember spending hours in all of the dungeons and trying to figure out the puzzles. Twilight Princess was definitely my favorite, because, when I played it, i loved everything about it.  It just had a more immersive experience for me."
