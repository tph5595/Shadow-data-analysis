2) Ocarina of Time
3) Link to the Past

In my opinion anyway. Wind Waker was the first I played and it got me into the world of Zelda, so naturally it'd be my favourite if for nothing else but nostalgia. OoT was my second and it was simply amazing. The huge landscapes and claustrophobic dungeons were just great. LttP comes in at 3rd because this is where Zelda truly started to kick off (yes, the original for the NES was literally where it all started, but it never really clicked with me)."
