36298,"Yep. You spend all this time riding around on horseback and there's *absolutely nothing there*. All those repetitive textures...I felt like I was playing a beta version sometimes. And then the bland and super-simple boss fights.

TP was still a great game, I just don't understand how people put it ahead of OoT or Wind Waker or Majora.

36787,I'm amazed by how much shit SS gets. I remember thinking it had the most solid gameplay since Ocarina.
70415,Yea I get that it felt a little restrictive...if they had worked on the sky portion a bit more (so that exploring felt more rewarding) I think it would have gone a long way toward remedying that problem. That was the part that people seemed to love about Wind Waker.
