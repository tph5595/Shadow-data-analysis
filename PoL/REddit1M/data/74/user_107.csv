64507,It's my favorite game next to ALttP. But I totally agree with the empty bits in the field. I flat out stopped playing after I died halfway to getting to that cat lady or return the bridge or whatever (it's been a while) but I just remember I stopped playing once I realized I had to traverse around that boring landscape again
