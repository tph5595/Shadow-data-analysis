7847,I feel like the youngins will skew this with their lack of understanding of the greatness that is A link to the Past. Triforce of the gods. Shame ninteno censored that name.
36321,Its the best zelda when viewed as a complete package. Timeless. Classic. Masterpiece.  
37477,Yes objectively and it is 2D so idk wtf you are on about.
39036,Kids these days.
40128,"As you get older you will learn when to argue and when to ""copout."" "
42336,I feel ya man...
42615,Wrong about what?
42809,"Had seasons, never played ages. Have both on my 3ds and have not touched em. "
43085,"1. Learn what """" do to a word. 2. Im not wrong. LttP is a zelda that will never get a hd remake because it litterally will not age. Its a perfect experience. Its art, story, and gameplay defined the genera. When they made OOT they took lttp formula and focused upon the 3d transition. The groundwork was so solid that they could instead focus upon the transiton. Not to mention how lttp saved the series after Zelda 2s shit sales."
45050,"How has it aged? Why is it not a complete experience?

And yeah I was wrong about zelda 2 sales. I was readind a bunch of articles about Miyamotos favorite zelda and an article said it had anemic sales due to famicom slowdown. Cant find that article on my phone. 

Oot is only special because of when it came out and what it did. To put it in a more modern analogy, it was the halo of 3d gaming controls. "
65291,"Lol. And someone didnt read all the way down OR take issue with his trivialization of people who like lttp. So, at risk of sounding ageist, learn to read kid."
67921,"If you did read all the way down you wouldnt have requested me to list actual reasons. Cause I did.

I was talking about the comment I replied to in terms of trivialization. 

I only reddit on mobile and as such cannot be bothered to correct each typo. 

Edit: his comment 
"" Ha, no not at all objectively. The arguments from you people with nostalgia for LttP are hilarious. And you're right that it's 2D, I accidentally switched the words there.""

He trivialized me so I did it back. Much the same as your response to me when you felt trivialized. "
68839,"You keep saying ageist like its a trump card yet fail to recognized that youth are limited due to age for a variety of reasons. Experience and decision making ability cheif among those reasons. 

Anywho, its not nostalgia that drives my argument it is objective reasoning which I was unable to provide before being lumped into a nostalgia group. But you can have your opinion and ill have mine. "
69726,"We are having a disconnect.  Im talking about what he said. You are talking about what you said.

Edit: I never presented my argument in the way you are representing it. 3 comments or so into my discussion with the other guy he lumps me into  his preconcieved nostalgia group. I responded by lumping him onto a group in kind. You read the thread and got upset at a comment that wasnt even directed at you. Then you continue to misrepresent my argument.  Nowhere did I say all new games suck or anything of the like. I said that LttP is a timeless classic and objectively the best zelda that would be underrepresented by the population of people who are too young to have played it. A guy who admits to having only played a ""bit"" of it responds calling me out on my assertion. He then ""copsout"" saying my argument fueled upon nostalgia is wrong about a game he hasnt played. And yet im the bad guy. Lol. I cant explain any simpler. "
