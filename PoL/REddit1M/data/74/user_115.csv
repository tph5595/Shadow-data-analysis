85245,"I started playing it, got a decent way into it, and stopped. It's not my kind of Zelda game. While I can appreciate the break from the normal style of the series, the fact is that [(possible spoiler)](/s ""it depresses the hell out of me that the point of the game is to help Link accept his own death and move on to the afterlife""). I mean, that's a really interesting concept and a break from the usual, but I didn't feel the love for MM the way I loved many of the other games.

The game was too dark for my tastes, and the repetitiveness kept me from wanting to finish it. But I can still see where the love for the game comes from.
