In the beginning what you need is to grab a fairy, floating around multiple places in clocktown.  You then take that fairy to the Queen Fairy, and she gives you magic power, which can be used to get the Ocarina back from Skull Kid at the end of the first cycle."

Take either left, or right, and complete everything in that side of the dungeon (it really isn't much).  Then go to the opposite side, finish all that, and you'll have everything you need to move forward from the whirlpool, into the boss chamber."
