34990,Nope.
35060,"I'm pretty young and I've played a bit of ALttP. Not even close to my favorite. But like I said, haven't played the whole thing."
35149,Because we all have different nostalgia's.
36522,"Not objectively. And since I prefer the 3D games to the 2D ones anyway, I doubt I would end up liking it more."
37614,"Ha, no not at all objectively. The arguments from you people with nostalgia for LttP are hilarious. And you're right that it's 2D, I accidentally switched the words there."
39237,Nice copout.
41832,"Well you only ever actually need to copout when you're wrong. Either way the mature thing is to admit you're wrong, not to cop out and resort to the ""ur wrong cuz ur a kid"" nonsense. So no I don't think I'll learn to start using copouts."
42862,"Wrong about anything. If you are arguing and realize you are wrong, the immature thing to do is cop out, and the mature thing is to admit you're wrong. In this situation, you are wrong to say LttP is objectively the best Zelda, and you chose the immature choice.  
You say I will learn to copout, but I won't, because cop-ing out is not what someone older should do, as it's immature and it only shows you have no actual reasoning, just nostalgia goggles."
44004,"&gt;LttP is a zelda that will never get a hd remake because it litterally will not age.  

It already has aged.  

&gt;Its a perfect experience.  

Nope  

&gt;Its art, story, and gameplay defined the genera. When they made OOT they took lttp formula and focused upon the 3d transition.  

You mean genre? So? That doesn't make it the best Zelda game. If *anything* it could be argued it's the best of the 2D Zelda's, which is still very very subjective. Ocarina of Time is much more genre defining and representative of the series than LttP. OoT added plenty more than a transition to 3D and you've clearly never played it if you think otherwise. Ocarina of Time is far more important to the series than LttP, but influence doesn't have anything to do with the quality of the game anyway.  

&gt;Not to mention how lttp saved the series after Zelda 2s shit sales.  

Are you kidding? Zelda 2 was the sixth best selling game on NES. It sold 4.38 million and LttP sold 4.61 million on its own, and it was part of a bundle with the console. So if Zelda 2 sold poorly, so did LttP even as part of a bundle.  

I get that LttP is a great game and I get that you like it. But calling it objective best is just silly and you know it."
45472,"I don't know what you mean by complete experience. I think it's imperfect in its music, controls to an extent, menu, art in some cases (menu, Link has pink hair).  
None of these things are *bad* by any means, but there are only a handful of songs on it I really liked, the SNES Dpad is worse than a stick, just general things like that have gotten better overtime.  
Link to the Past is special in a similar way for what it did to 2D games like it at the time, and for the series. But, if influence meant quality then Tennis for Two would be the universal greatest game of all time, and the original Zelda would be the best Zelda.  
Anyway, we aren't convincing eachother of anything, so let's just agree to disagree."
