8187,"What part is it that confuses you? I'm not trying to be a douche, I just wanna see if I can make things clearer for you. It's my all time favourite game, and I want every zelda-fan to enjoy it as much as I did. 

edit: word"
58601,"Seems like you're already getting some help, so that's good. last year I replayed it and I too struggled at times, with what to do next and what not. So even though I didn't like it I had to use a [walkthrough](http://www.zeldadungeon.net/Zelda06-majoras-mask-walkthrough.php). This walkthrough is actually very good, and will take you through every part of the game. So I would recommend that you use the walkthrough when you're stuck, and when you get on the right track again you just ditch it. I know this can be kinda taboo amongst gamers, but if it gets to a point where it ruins your experience with the game I think it should be allowed

59718,"This might be a dumb question, but did you use the inverted song of time? It slows time down to 1/3(I think?) of its normal speed. When using this I had no trouble getting through dungeons and stuff. Fast travel by Kaepora Gaebora will also save you some time. 

Other than that, if you wanna explore you'll need to plan for this. Use three days for exploring, put your new-earned cash in the bank, and reset the timer when you're ready for another dungeon. 

That being said, I also find the game very anxiety-inducing. Especially how the music gets creepier the less time you got. This is what makes the game great imo. But I don't like doing things twice in games either, so you'll need to plan for how to use your time. "
