56147,"Adventure of Link...anyone...echo....echo...Well you all owe it some respect for Link's ""down attack"" I'm looking at you smash brothers and TP players. 

if I could ask nintendo for one thing it would be a true homage to Zelda 2. a3d game that captured the feel of this game. (it would probably need to be a second zelda game on whatever console it came out on though) 

those temples...the attacks...the mazes and secret pits..the difficult armored enemies...the towns...the music, omg the music... 

this is my favorite zelda game ever!"
68099,sweet I will...there's also an obscure nes game that is really similar.  battle of Olympus.  check it out if you haven't.
