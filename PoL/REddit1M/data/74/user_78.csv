And you had to put your hand in a good starting position before the fight began, if you weren't correctly positioned it would throw everything off. Fighting was a much more tactical experience. I absolutely loved it."

Also being driven to explore is really nice, but it could be better if the intermediary terrain was more than just water, and if the rewards were better than 90% rupees. I like the dungeons, but the puzzle solving seems a bit stripped down, less integrated into the world. Its a good game but considering tech limitations alttp oot and ss are all superior. Its a close fourth. Of course I can't stand mm so take my opinion for what its worth."

And if I was in the middle of something and the last day came around I would have to start over, that caused more rage quitting than every other Zelda game I've played combined. I just can't stand having to do the same thing over again."
