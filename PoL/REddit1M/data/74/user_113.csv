76811,"I thought it was bad.   
  
It marked the end of the classic Zelda gameplay format for me, which was Myamoto-perfect and shouldn't have been altered. Among other things, the classic setup of an open world is a must for a game to be a real zelda game.
  
Anyway, I thought the lengthy cutscenes were incredibly annoying. It completely ruined the pacing of the game. Instead of rewarding a player with more intense and rewarding gameplay, more often than not, the player is brought out of his/her immersion with a cutscene. The bad design choice of having to traverse the same area(s) twice, once as a wolf and the other time as Link, that did it for me. It's the only Zelda I didn't finish, with no intention of ever going back to it.
  
I'm still working on Skyward sword, which suffers from the same problems, but with a buddy on your side who can take over once a while, it's pretty okay."
