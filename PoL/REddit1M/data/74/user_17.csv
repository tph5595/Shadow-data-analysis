9748,It's like asking which child is my favorite. How can you ask me to choose?? :)
18676,"Nice summary. As an 80's kid who's first really *was* LoZ, I agree. I liked TP, though... For me a description might be that it always looked up to MM &amp; tried to be like him, but ended up just doing the emo thing - dark &amp; deep on the surface, but his heart really wasn't in it.

Link to the Past is the child that's bright &amp; cheerful all the time. He's creative &amp; exciting in his own way, but never really gets in trouble.

To add on to AoL, yeah... that's a deeply disturbed kid. I'm not sure where I went wrong with that one as a parent. I still like it, though, and enjoy it's company. But it's just... different &amp; dark."
