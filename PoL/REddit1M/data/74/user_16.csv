9489,"People dislike the idea of rails a lot more than they actually dislike the rails. 

Spirit Tracks had great dungeons and the best Zelda of any game in the series. But people dislike rails, so I guess it must suck lol."
9578,"I'm surprised at how high it is too. I'd be in favor of a discussion thread on each game, but fear they might get a bit circlejerky."
13547,Honestly it felt like they were trying to recapture why OoT was so good and just failed at it. Wasn't a fan of the wolf sections either. 
20080,"Also the bait and switch Ganon, lack of (good) side quests and empty overworld."
21466,Being a page from alttp doesn't make it good though. I think the bait and switch was more severe in TP as well.
26752,"No. I completely disagree.

67068,"I don't understand how the demon trains could have been so much of a problem for you that you would think them so bothersome that you would stop playing altogether, they were pretty easy to plan around.  

I thought the Whirlwind, Whip and Sand Wand were all excellent and imaginative items, so much so that the Whip returned in SS and Sand Rod appeared in ALBW.  
I enjoyed all of the dungeons in the game, honestly. They might have taken the easy route on the themes of the dungeons Forest/Fire/Water/Sand/Ice, but that doesn't make them inherently bad. They had good puzzles, interesting mechanics and fun.  I also really loved the spirit tower, because the puzzles and combat sections with Phantom Zelda were great.
  
The plot wasn't the strongest, but it's a Zelda game, and they never really are fantastic plots, are they? The writing was fun and light hearted, Zelda was written fantastically and she actually contributed to the gameplay in a big way.  
Edit: I've just looked at some of your other comments on the subject of ST, and it appears you just didn't have fun playing it. That's fine, but it also sounds like you didn't want to enjoy it. As if you were playing it out of obligation, that's obviously going to impact how much you enjoy the playthrough."
68804,"But those items are still new and imaginative, even if you didn't particularly enjoy them or their reiterations in future games.  
&gt; I should correct myself (and you) here.  

This isn't correcting me, this is stating your opinion and saying that you're correcting me. I don't think ""pretty decent"" does justice to the dungeons in Spirit Tracks, because they're better than that.  
  
&gt;Story, lore etc.   

This obviously doesn't appeal to me as much as it appeals to you, I like the lore/story/whatever of Zelda but it's not the main reason I play. Spirit Tracks doesn't throw it out the window though, it continues on in the future, after the flood when a new Hyrule is founded.  
  
Forcing yourself to play it isn't going to make it fun. Maybe sometime in the future you could give it a replay, maybe a 3 heart challenge or something. "
70201,"You flat out said that there were no new/imaginative items, to which I rebutted three examples. I don't even think you feel strongly on that point as you're giving PH a pass but it introduced no new items.  
&gt;Something to do with decent=good???  

I don't see the point of this part, you're just trying to seem like you're hard to impress because you're not an average joe. Edgy.  
  
You've contradicted yourself multiple times in different comment threads and are being surprisingly ignorant for no apparent reason, I have no interest in continuing this discussion, because of the obvious bias you have against the game."
