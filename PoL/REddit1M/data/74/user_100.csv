57041,"I'm tied between Adventure of Link and A Link to the Past for the great adventure story.

AoL had amazing gameplay, darkness, and magic attributes - and hard as shit.  ALTTP was an amazing adventure story.

Ocarina was good, but kinda cartoony characters, lonely, and depressing or something.  Maybe I got too old... I don't know."
