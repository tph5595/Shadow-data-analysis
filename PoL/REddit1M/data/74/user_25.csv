16793,"Stone Tower is definitely the coolest, but I think Great Bay Temple is definitely the hardest temple. Redirecting water and shit, while trying to get all the fairies. Gah. "
16861,LoL easily the worst 3D LoZ game. To each their own I guess...
17736,"Well, OOT is the son that does everything pretty well, and everyone loves him. He may be full of himself, but he's a good guy, gets pretty good grades, and plays sports too.

Original LoZ is your first born. No matter what happens, or what he does, you always love him.

MM is the smartest and maturest of your kids. He's not going to be the most liked, but will probably be the most successful.

TP is your retarded child that wants to be like the cool, popular, OOT, but just fails miserably. You love him anyways, because he's your own, but you can't help but laugh hysterically at everything he does because it's so ridiculous.

Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks are your two annoying twins that dress alike and pull twin pranks all the time. You love them, but you have a feeling if something ever happened to them, your family wouldn't take that long to get over it. You'd look at OOT and MM and thank the lord it wasn't them instead.

AOL is your rebel child. He does everything differently just for the sake of it. Dresses weird, acts weird, has a spikey colored mohawk all for no concrete reason. Just because. There's more to him than that, but that's all he really lets you see at first."
18279,"1. World never really feels like it is in peril. This game gets praised for having dark themes, but OOT and MM do this much better.

2. Muddy graphics. In an attempt to keep up with the ""dark"" themes of this game, they screwed up the graphics, making things difficult to see at times. The game just ends up looking brown.

3. They made a big deal about the combat system and learning new stuff. It was all for naught. I found myself almost never needing anything besides just hacking vertically and horizontally with the sword. The Ganon fight requires a bit more than this, but the other 99.9% of the game, it is not needed.

4. Wolf mode is boring. Seriously, it's just boring. Neat idea, but poor execution.

5. New items go almost unused outside the dungeon they are discovered. Spinner, ball and chain, dominion rod, and even the boomerang all have very little use outside of the dungeon they are discovered in.

6. Poor enemy AI. Walk into a field and see how long it takes for an enemy to hack you to bits. Get a beer. It will be a while. In addition to being stupid and not swinging often, they don't even hit hard when they do."
18352,It took me forever to beat. I bought it a year after it came out and didn't finish it til long after I finished Skyward Sword.
20721,"IDK, TP is way more of an OOT wannabe than it is an MM wannabe. It shares an obvious darkness with MM, but the similarities end there.

OOT and TP on the other hand, both have adult Link, number of dungeons and dungeon themes are similar, both have a faux open world, and the Hyrules in both are very similar. And that's just a start."
22171,"For the most part, that is true, but doing it the first time, there was no way to know that."
27212,MM isn't really about the dungeons. Though Stone Tower Temple is fantastic.
27284,See my above post on why I think TP sucks.
27362,SS is my favorite 3D Zelda game I think. That or MM. I have no idea why people think it's an inferior game.
37088,I agree. My only complaint was that it was a bit linear.
41295,Turning off rumble pack/vibration helps.
