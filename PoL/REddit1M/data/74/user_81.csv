41781,"Yeah. I was talking to someone a while back and he said how it was ""okay"" I was taken back by it. But recently I booted up an emulator and wow, it is not as good as I remember. Still good though, I think it takes awhile for the fun to kick in because you really need to finish the water temple before the game starts getting really good. I still think wind waker is the best one. Ocarina of Time I feel is one of the more weaker games now compared to the newer ones but when people say it's better than all the other ones it drives me nuts because most likely they have nostalgia goggles (it's a good game but it has had huge aging issues). If you say the 3ds version then yes that is a league among many of the games but the original version that ran at like 20-25 FPS with a terrible water temple? Really?"

Link to the past is a good game but I don't think you can compare it to wind waker. There should be a 3D and non 3d section for favorite because obviously the 3D ones are gonna be the highest rated. I chose WW but I really wanted to pick Minish Cap."
