31470,"ALBW is just a damn good game.  Very clean controls, enough of a borrow from ALttP that it improves the experience without feeling lazy, cool dungeons, fun puzzles, merging is one of my favorite Zelda gimmicks ever.  Hell, even the speedruns are some of the better Zelda runs.  It's glitchy enough for a good speedrun but it's almost impossible to encounter a glitch in casual playthroughs.  Definitely my favorite Zelda."
