29543,"I expected a bit more love for Minish Cap. I found I had the most fun in that game. Nothing ever felt like a chore or that it dragged on. If only it wasn't a bit short. But if you haven't played it, try it out right now! "
39391,"I enjoyed PH a lot more than I thought I would've. I'm currently playing ALTTP and it's pretty hard to put down the controller. I think I prefer the overhead 2D Zelda. The 3D ones are more epic, but I have a lot more fun in the other ones. I was surprised how much I enjoyed the first Zelda! "
58716,"I'm playing through OoT for the first time, I was lucky enough to have it included with the N64 I bought off of someone. While it is amazing, I don't see why it gets all the love pretty much. It might be mostly nostalgia. Although I'm only up to the fourth dungeon. I'm not doubting that it's amazing, but a lot of people speak like it's the only amazing Zelda game "
