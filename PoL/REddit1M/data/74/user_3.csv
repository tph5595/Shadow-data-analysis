3006,"Well guess I will have to do with voting for WW since FPTRR isn't on it.  

how is PH getting votes but not ST?"
4630,Yeah but I wasn't sure if OP counted those.
5328,"It's the same principle as PH or even WW though.  
traveling through a bunch of nothing to reach something."
5823,"Well yeah, but the thing I find strange is that ST isn't getting votes, while PH is.  

If neither of them had any votes I wouldn't have thought anything of it."
11441,"Yeah, a lot of people hate on that game without ever having played it.

21273,original isn't automatically better then sequel.
64467,"What makes ST bad then?  
It is pretty much PH, worked out better and with set tracks instead of drawing your own path."
65174,opinions tend to differ
66544,"Yeah, your only reasoning is ""this one was fun (for you)   

PH had even less story then ST, and less charictarization, with the only character plot being developed was (albeit awesome) Linebeck
The dungeons were less worked out, and it played it super safe, none of the items were ""unique"" in anyway.  

I honestly don't see how you can find one ""carming"" and the other ""a moneygrab"" seeing as they are practically the same, just that ST has more work put into it."
67723,"Oh ok, now I get it.  
You are someone who hates it when the same thing is done more then once, got ya."
