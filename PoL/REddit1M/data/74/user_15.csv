8630,I'm honestly surprised at the number of Twilight Princess votes. I think we need a discussion thread for each Zelda game over a number of days :P
9736,Discussing Zelda games is super fun to me. Was discussing them with a few friends the other night and it was surprising at how serious we got. One of the most civilised conversations we've ever had xD
21610,"I liked that the world was big, but it was way too empty. It felt like there was nothing to do and I felt no need to explore it. I like a lot of the dungeons and the progression is pretty solid, but the wolf sections drag it down for me.

Again, we need proper discussion threads, I might announce this and see how popular it goes down."
