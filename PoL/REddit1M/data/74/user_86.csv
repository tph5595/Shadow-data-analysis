44995,"I grew up playing The Legend of Zelda for years as my only game. Later in life, I played a lot of Ocarina of Time, Majora's Maks, Windwaker, Twilight Princes, Four Swords, Minish Cap, and occasionally I'd start up Zelda II. I've only passed the first dungeon of Skyword Sword. To me, the game lacks any connection to the true Zelda story and retains little feel of what I would consider a Zelda game. The characters act too modern, the acting and plot seems middleschool, and the traveling annoys me.  The map is set up more like a Mario world than a Zelda world. I have a hard time finding a reason to like this game. 

Best game in the series is obviously Ocarina of Time. The runner-ups are interesting."
