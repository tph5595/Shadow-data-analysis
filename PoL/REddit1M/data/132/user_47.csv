True story- When they send the scroll (it is really long- almost floor to ceiling) it comes with a little miniature version. About 5/8 of an inch wide and 5 inches long. I'm guessing.

Anyway, I decide to tape it to the side of one of my monitors at work. Realized yesterday it was upside-down.  

Time to get new glasses...."
