1516,"the artwork is actually made in such a way that the top and bottom connect, which is pretty cool.  "
1656,"Not completely true (anymore).  
This is back from pre-skyward sword, as you can see by only Fi being there from SS, and not Levias, the dragons,the scrapper, groose and so forth.  
As such, it is missing a bunch of SS characters, as well as ALBW and TFH

Still a great artwork though."
1972,"I can name all of them except for the Zora band, which I only know the group name of : ""The Indigo-go's""  
Mostly cause the zora band is not really important to the story beyond Mikau and Lulu."
2090,Something we can definitly agree on.  
3121,exactly.
5130,"Nah he's in there.  
In the ""side characters pile"", he is on the left, below Kafkei and anju, but above the zora band.  
he's throwing his confetti."
8421,"this is from before Skyward Sword was released, all we knew about ti was Fi, which is why she is in, but nothing else from SS is."
8428,It's bellum.
8431,Yes.
8503,"It's the artists impression of Daphness Nohansen Hyrule (or the king of hyrule in general)  
(note how he made up new clothing/accesory designs for each of the sages as well)"
8556,"Nah, like the otherguy said, It's bellum."
8575,Link's mother (OoT flashback)
8616,"Look again mate, the glorious captain himself is right there.  
(no Linebeck the third though (for obvious reasons))"
8626,It has Fi in it.
8659,It's a bit of a Twilight Princess spoiler [It is Midna's true form](/spoiler)
8718,"Also no SS beyond fi, no ALBW, no TFH, and no HW.  
Afterall, it is hard to draw something that does not yet exist."
9317,"I'm assuming he goes off the idea that the current ruler is the ""seventh sage/leader of the sages"", offcourse in OoT, the king is dead by the time we ""use"" the sages, thus it is Zelda's role then.  
but we could assume that the king was the seventh sage or had the potential to be if needed."
10532,"No, that's Fierce Deity.  
This was made before SS was release, a little after we learned of Fi's existance, so people didn't even know about Demise yet."
10807,"Also : not all enemies in TP have an eye.  
"
11597,"Funny thing : neither of the two is actually ""from nintendo"" if you think about it.  
Sakurai and his team at Namco decided on Cloud, and Tecmo decided on Linkle.  

And I knew you meant it like that, but in this case, it would have been impossible for her to even be in it anyway.  
Sad you got downvoted for just not being glad that an ""OC DO NOT STEAL"" character got added to the game about bringing together zelda characters though.  
"
11694,"She is far from ""in the back""  
She is right in the middle of the fairies and ""spirits"" section.  
Very clearly in sight.  
I know you just want to use this as a way to shit on SS and Fi for no good reason, but atleast try to go for something that is actually true then."
13051,it sure is.
13565,"Yes, like I said 
&gt;
I know you just want to use this as a way to shit on SS and Fi for no good reason,"
13999,"Well, it is not as much a flashback as it is the deku sprout telling about it with some vague visuals in the background like fires and shit."
15972,I'm not ?
16112,"Triforce is there.  
it's inside the triforce trio."
16411,"ah, could be.  
I have... a *following* at times.  
it's pretty funny."
16623,"Jep, : Small one that is on look out : Zuko  
Small one with glasses : Mako  
Niko : Niko  
Big guy with green shirt : Gonzo  
Guy that protects Tetra's room : Nudge  (funfact : nudge is the strongest of the pirates)  
Guy with the purple shirt : Senza."
16733,"Sounds about right, yeah."
63811,"No, that's the wind fish (Link's awakening)  
levias looks similar in some ways, but there are differences.  

MOst notably, is that [the windfish](http://guidesmedia.ign.com/visualhistory/weirdest_zelda/wind_fish.jpg) has wings, and [Levias](http://vignette3.wikia.nocookie.net/zelda/images/f/fb/Levias.png/revision/latest?cb=20111130161926) doesn't."
64219,Cause they needed to put in *linkle*
65155,"You actually made a small mistake.  
Tatl is directly next to Tael, the one you have labelled as Tatl atm is probably Ciela from Phantom hourglass.  

Edit : saw other people already pointed it out."
65264,"Well, it's not like name sharing doesn't happen a lot throughout the generations anyway."
65286,"That one never carried a baby.  
"
65306,"Ganondorf is the human form, Ganon is the ""beast/demon"" form"
65647,"Grrr, Kafke-berg"
65815,"It was made before Skyward Sword was out.  
Fi is only in there from the trailer."
66199,Definitly better to differentiate them with then we get from OoT's story....
66265,"Look for the ones with the little bells inside, for the authentic makar shuffle experience."
66328,"Cremia and Romani are there, as well as Marin.  
Which are all counterparts to Malon."
66346,"Ezlo is there, the rest isn't."
66384,"THe three goddesses, with their silhoutte design based on the oracles of the same names."
66536,"Guess the creator didn't think she was as important as the rest.  
Shame really, I would have liked to see Telma with her.  

THat said, there is a BUNCH still missing from this picture, which is obvious if you consider how many god damn characters we have by now."
66559,Independent.  
66606,"He is there, in the big pile of side characters, on the left side, below Anju and Kafei and above the zora band."
66655,"Yeah, but don't worry, we have a second link and a second zelda instead !!!!  "
66713,"She is there, jus tnot in her imp form."
66729,good chocie.
66807,"Well ""Ganon"" does have his trident in HW, but only as his weakness break attack in the ""giant"" mode."
66862,"Your sentence is confusing...  
But the triforce is inside the triforce trio near the top.  
They have the symbols shining through on their hands"
67792,"Yeah, the main thing that is different between them is that the windfish has wings, levias just swims through the air.  
ALso, windfish has decorative stuff on him, while levias just has the platform-like thing on his back."
69362,There is nothing to really imply ganon(dorf) isn't evil himself.
69858,"Not really no, but there is also multiple Links in this picture, So I'd say having multiple ganon(dorf)s isn't that strange, since they are the main characters of the series afterall."
71199,"We don't know if that IS convention in Hyrule though.  
Not to mention this could be the artists intrepertation of the sages and Daphness before the flood, with Daphness taking the role of the seventh sage with (OoT) Zelda gone during that time.  
The sages also seem to be wearing more ritualistic clothing/accesories."
77799,"Nope, it is canon.  
The person who said that was a canadian nintendo spokeperson, who clearly had no idea what she was talking about  
(or was missunderstood, and what she meant was that TFH was a ""seperate"" entity from the main series, as in : ""it didn't take resources away from Zelda U)  

"
87158,True.
87360,I'm actually surprised the artist didn't include a subrosian (rosa) nor the three animal compagnions.
87380,It seems the be the artist's interpertation of the Butler's son.
88484,"Hyrule Wariors already had a bunch of females anyway.  
(original cast actually had a majority of females, thanks to the fact most of Link's allies are females)  

But I agree, there  were so many better EXISTING characters to choose from.  
I liked Cia and Lana caused they were essentially there to make the story ""work"", but Linkle is just such a wasted choice imo."
90800,Cause she looks the exact same as Cremia and Romani probably.
