13546,Cool stuff.  Veran is so awesome.  She needs more fan-art of her.  One of my favourite Zelda villains.  Also Fi being the only SS character confused me because I was looking for Groose but I couldn't find him and then I read the comments.
13668,"Veran, the Sorceress of Shadows from Oracle of Ages.  She was hired by Twinrova along with Onox, the General of Darkness to light special flames that would revive Ganon.  She's a cool character, a tricky customer with lots of cool powers."
17164,"The Oracles from the Oracle games.  Oracle of Seasons Din, Oracle of Ages Nayru and Oracle of Secrets Farore.  They are named the same thing as the Golden Goddesses but they are their own characters."
20099,"Yeah, the Golden Goddesses created the world of Zelda and the Triforce.  Since they are important in the legends of that world, people would name their kids after them which is likely why the parents of an Oracle named their kid that."
