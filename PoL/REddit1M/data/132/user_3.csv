[And here's the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x3sM9PHAkOo)

~~EDIT: idk why I can't see OP's comment.  It said I couldn't reply because it was deleted, and now it's not visible to me.  WTF?~~

Edit again: Looks like there was a spam filter issue.  Thanks for the fix, /u/Take_the_RideX!

I had the version that was just a silk print, but that's no longer available.

[This scroll](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00C0IHWL0) is the only thing I found.

If anyone finds the regular print--be aware that it has a tendency to roll (both in the direction it was rolled up to begin with, and side-to-side when hung).  I recommend getting a frame, if you can find one in the right size."

EDIT: opened an incognito tab to see if it's user-specific, and I still don't see it."
