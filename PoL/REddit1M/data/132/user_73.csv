20859,He's probably just too used to my username and got mixed up.
21271,"Who are you counting?

To point out all the ""Link"" appearances:

1. At the top next to Zelda.

2. At the bottom as the Wolf.

3. At the bottom as the Hero's Spirit

4. At the bottom as the baby.

5. At the bottom possibly counting Fierce Deity/Dark Link.

AFAIK Link isn't anywhere else in the picture."
21391,"Alright, I gotta know: who are the guys under the great deku tree? Are they from TP?"
22196,"Nah. The [soldier looking people.](http://i.imgur.com/Q0Zaghg.png)

I get the feeling they're probably from TP, because that's really the only game I don't remember well, and they look like they'd belong there."
23591,"Awesome. That's what I was thinking, but I wasn't certain. And thanks for that labeled version. There were a few characters I wasn't certain of, but had more or less a good idea of who they were."
44527,"Depends on who you all count. If you don't count Fierce Deity or Dark Link, it'd be 4. If you don't count the baby either it'd be 3. And if you count them all it'd be 6."
48345,"Well yes and no. The baby may or may not be Link (it probably is).

Fierce Deity could be considered his own character, or you could consider it Fierce Deity Link.

And Dark Link isn't actually Link, but just a shadow/dark version.

As I said, it depends on what you count as ""Link""."
