388532,Bro same here I'm super hyped for Civil War and the upcoming THor: Ragnorak. Did you know it was confirmed that the Hulk will be in it? Hulk in a Thor movie... seems kind of odd. I mean don't get me wrong I'm excited but I hope they don't use the Hulk as like a comic relieve kind of character.
