9432,"Um, I've just noticed. Veran's tits are not covered in the slightest. Unless that just the lighting."
9602,Is that dragon next to the OoT Great Fairy Valoo?
12479,"Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's Valoo; Jabun is right below him."
12564,"I'm making one with labels of all of their names right now. I'll post it in a minute.

Edit: Alright, it should be somewhere in the comments now."
15448,"Alright, I just added labels on top of every character for reference. Here: http://i.imgur.com/lizacrc.jpg

Edit: Okay I fixed it so that Ciela and Tatl are labeled correctly: http://i.imgur.com/33fhJho.jpg"
15537,Ralph too.
15735,"I kinda want to name a future kid of mine Daphnes Nohansen (My last name), but he'd probably be bullied."
15841,What the hell are you getting downvoted for?
16052,Malladus is missing :(
16304,"A lot of your comments have zero points for some reason; I upvoted them because I saw no reason for this. Unless you are just not upvoting your own comments, somebody else is downvoting them."
16377,You could name all of the pirates? I had to go on zelda wiki for that. 
16518,"Oh yeah, there's that guy down there who might be responsible. I also recognise your name from the Zelda Cycle thread."
18498,I also wish Malladus was in there too.
22588,"They are the resistance from TP, an organisation headed by Telma to oppose Zant and the Moblin army. They are labeled [on this picture.](https://i.imgur.com/lizacrc.jpg)"
22647,[Done.](https://i.imgur.com/lizacrc.jpg) I posted it up above a while ago.
22811,"I think those are the actual goddesses in this case, considering the fact that they're all the way at the top. Also, I always thought that the oracles *were* the three goddesses ""in a different form"" per-se. "
22987,Ralph is the fucking best. A lot of the reason why I like Ages so much more than Seasons is because there are just so many more characters and personalities in Ages than Seasons.
23053,"Yeah, in retrospect, some of them are kind of eye-straining. Is there any way to re-edit text boxes in MS paint?"
23124,"I mean, same thing, really. I just figured that was the artist's way of portraying both at the same time."
23218,"Oh yah, lol. Her hair is kind of brushed to the side."
24116,"* Ralph: Probably the best fucking side character ever. He is a character from Oracle of Ages who claims to be the Oracle Nayru's protector. He basically competes with Link throughout the whole game. [For more info here is the wiki page, though there are spoilers so you might not want to click.](http://zeldawiki.org/Ralph)

* Veran: She is the main antagonist of Oracle of Ages. There's really not much else to say. [Here's the page. Again: spoilers](http://zeldawiki.org/Veran)

* Linebeck: He is also one of the best fucking side characters ever. He appears in Phantom Hourglass as the rupee-obsessed, treasure-loving sailor. He is one of Link's companions that travels with him in this game. Also, his grandson, Linebeck III, appears with a smaller role in Spirit Tracks. His [theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewWTyCvJh9M) is pretty great too. [Wiki, oh god the spoilers](http://zeldawiki.org/Linebeck)

* Bellum: Bellum is an ancient monster, and the main antagonist from Phantom Hourglass. He's basically a brainless parasite octopus thing. I don't recall if he has any lines in the game, but I'm pretty sure he can't talk. [Wiki, spoilers](http://zeldawiki.org/Bellum)

Also, don't worry, you won't lose your Zelda card. You just don't appear to have played Oracle of Ages or Phantom Hourglass (maybe not Spirit Tracks either?). You should, however, play them soon."
24266,"Yeah, that's what I thought, or, if he doesn't think they are the same, he designed the goddesses close to the Oracle forms so they could be easily distinguishable."
24520,Had no idea who you were talking about until I put it into Zelda wiki. What language region is that from. His name is Byrne in the U.S.
26366,"Oh shit. Whoops, Tatl completely blended in with the background. You're right, the blue one is Ciela. I'll fix it later."
29860,Actually the one I labeled Tatl is Ciela. I completely missed the real Tatl next to Tael.
72300,"Well, that's because the picture was made before SS."
72392,"I checked the cloaks, and they're a bit different. Also, if it is TP Zelda, then it wouldn't really make sense for her to be carrying a baby."
72810,"Ganondorf is the man. Ganon is the beast after Ganondorf was transformed by the triforce. They are the same person; Ganon is the Triforce's reflection of Ganondorf's desires through his body.

You might already know this, but I love saying it anyway: there have only ever been two Ganondorf/Ganons in the entire history of the Zelda games (If you don't count Demise as being a Ganondorf). The first one lived from OoT all the way through the end of the decline timeline, Wind Waker in the adult timeline, and Twilight Princess in the child timeline. Then, later in the child timeline, another man was born to the Gerudo as a reincarnation of Ganondorf."
79993,"I said this below but,

&gt; there have only ever been two Ganondorf/Ganons in the entire history of the Zelda games (If you don't count Demise as being a Ganondorf).

~~I guess that still fits the picture though. You could have the OoT Ganondorf at the top, and the FSA Ganon at the bottom.~~ Actually, wait, the one at the bottom is holding the two swords like in OoT; the one from FSA had the Trident of Power."
82944,Maple is a witch from the Oracle games. She is also in A Link Between Worlds. Evan is the pianist in the Zora Band from Majora's Mask.
104504,"Lol, nice catch. When I saw them, ""Fish Drums"" immediately came to mind; I couldn't just not label it after that :P "
2195599,"The OoT great fairy and the MM great fairy are basically the same thing. I'm pretty sure the artist wanted to represent both in in one image though, so I just labeled it as the one from the game that came first.

Also, that is most definitely intended to be the OoT king. Rauru is already at the very left side of that row of sages."
5813298,"Huh, I didn't realise that before, but I guess she's not there."
