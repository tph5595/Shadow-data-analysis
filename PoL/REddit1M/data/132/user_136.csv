62873,"why is this sub so bad that this hits my front page? The lowest quality content is upvoted like crazy. This isn't a new picture I've seen it hundreds of times, and have had the 5'+ poster on my wall for well over a year. The same picture with nothing clever for the 100th time on my front page. Thanks /r/zelda just when I thought you couldn't get any worse."
