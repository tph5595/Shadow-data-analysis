304073,"Then it wouldn't be a limited edition piece. It would just be something everyone can have that has zero value. I personally collect for the thrill. If i can walk into a store and get it, i dont want it. I want to be forced to put in the work. Line up at 4am. Wait in the cold. It makes it much more rewarding. Again, its not a limited edition if everyone has one. You want it? Put in the work like everyone who did get one. I got one. I waiting in the blistering cold at 4am with 9 other ppl. The store only had 2. I was first in line. Got one. Why? Because I'm dedicated and organized (some might say a little crazy lol). My point is, you dont work, you dont get. Nintendo literally does not care. They will make one of everything or 1000 of everything or 100000. Doesn't matter to them. It will make ppl want it more and create a market for it. That's how business works. Sorry if i seem negative. Not trying to be. Just being real. "
304614,I knew about the master edition literally during the zelda footage at the end. I google breath of the wild and the gamestop twitter had it on there. it was like the 4th result. How is it that i knew and you didnt? I was gonna line up either way for the console. You cant expect to get what you want sitting behind a screen. You gotta get up and work for what you want. The old school way of lining up sometimes works better than ordering online.
