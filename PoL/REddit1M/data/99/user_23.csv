10195,"MASTER Edition - - Amazon sold out in 3 minutes. Gamestop available at this moment. Best Buy still not popping up for preorder.  I've got mine preordered in Amazon and Gamestop (one for me, one for best friend). I'll cancel one if I can snag one at Best Buy with GCU"
10428,CONGRATS!!! you were in the small tiny ass opening window !!!!
11502,Well. It looks like Gamestop has PLENTY. it's been available to add into a cart for 25 minutes now.
11674,Gamestop still has plenty of stock as of this moment.
11968,I don't think there is a MAsters or Special edition for Wii U. The pictures for both versions have a Nintendo NS cover art/box.
12896,"Try paypal. Some people are blacklisted from shopping at their online store (no problems in brick and mortar walk ins though). I now am able to purchase from them again is I use paypal. any credit card purchase will just error out cause the system flags you by name and/or address when buying by credit card. This is kind of permanent, but we got paypal."
48691,I think I got blacklisted because I was excessively using coupons. My last good purchase was Assassin's Creed II Collector's edition and I was blacklisted after that.  It seems the margins for profit for each software sale is very minimal and small so excessively using coupons and overselling your used games to them after puchasing it from them to make money(while using a coupon code to get more credit for your games) will black list you. I don't give a crap about the company but there are those odd times where Gamestop is the only place that sells a particular game or item and I have to go to a friend to purchase it for me.  But now we got paypal to let us through their checkup system like some loophole.
