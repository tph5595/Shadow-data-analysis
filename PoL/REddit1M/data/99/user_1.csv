836,If you come across a date when you can preorder in Europe.... just leaving this comment here! :D
109142,"yeah, I browsed the web all day yesterday, the only way, what I found at least, is to buy it in the US and then let a service company ship it to you, which still costs +60€ in tax (I live in Germany, +19%VAT) and shipping costs... so 160€ for the special edition... not worth it. :( Now it's sold out anyways.

I already preordered the switch + BotW Limited Edition here in Europe and maybe, if I'm lucky, they sell the Sheikah Slate Carrying Case separate, if they do that, I'm perfectly content. :)"
116141,"where do you live? I preordered it at a local retailer, not sure if I really am going to get it. I probably take the day off work and go there in the morning. "
150379,"I preordered at MediaMarkt/Saturn, a quick google search told me there is also a MediaMarkt in NL, so maybe try your luck there? I wish you best of luck! :)"
