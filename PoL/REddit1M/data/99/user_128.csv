63698,"So I placed my gamestop order around 3:40 am EST. I got the paypal confirmation and transaction ID, but nothing from gamestop. Is this normal? Should I be worried that regardless of paypal, I won't actually have a switch and master's edition preordered?


Edit: Finally got a rep after an hour. They fucked up my order, and it did not process even though paypal processed it. This isnt the first time gamestop has fucked me over."
