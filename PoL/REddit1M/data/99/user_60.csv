33838,I love how I signed up for Amazon's email notification for when pre-orders would be live and I never even got anything before they put it up and it sold out.
43506,That's what I'm thinking. I actually just managed to catch another opening a couple hours ago for the switch console though but once again they didn't even email. I just saw it by chance. At least I have an Amazon pre order which is way more reliable than Best Buy now. Now to hope I can be as lucky with a restock of the masters edition.
