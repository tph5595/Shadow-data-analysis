39685,Same. I went to mine when they opened and they only had the special and regular up for pre-order.
44586,"Not sure if is this is relevant, but the Masters Edition page on Game Stop's site now has an image instead of one of those gray place holder images. Maybe more pre orders are coming soon?"

47020,Got my Master's Edition on Best Buy! Looks like it's all out now though.
47496,They sold out at like 4am.
47708,Means it's sold out :(
47968,Good luck! 
48072,"Yeah, Reggie said that during today's Treehouse stream. I mean, there might be another wave? I remember during the Majora's Mask pre order craze, Amazon and Best Buy did them in waves as opposed to letting their entire inventory be up for grabs all at once."
48173,"The Masters Edition is only available at Amazon, Bet Buy, and Game Stop."
48475,I would say print out your order form and just go to Best Buy in person and see what they can do for you. Or even just make a payment right now to make some room?
49142,I feel you. I missed out on the Skull Kid statue for MM 3D due to stupid web site glitches. Worst feeling ever.
