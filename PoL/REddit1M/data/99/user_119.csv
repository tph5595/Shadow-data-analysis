And 90% of them are bought by fucking scalpers who sell it at triple the price on Ebay. It happened with the Majora's Mask 3DS, Amiibo, NES Classic, and now this. I fucking hate having to sleep with one eye open because they pop up on Target.com at 3 AM with no warning whatsoever. Nintendo really needs to get their shit together on this."
