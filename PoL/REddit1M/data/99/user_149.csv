371909,"Was able to get a master edition when ordering the switch by chance saw it on the website.

The question is does anyone know what the master sword is made out of? From the YouTube channel Reggie presented it to treehouse it looked like a cheap plastic item or maybe made out of vinyl. The sword wasn't straight it looked like it was bent doesn't look like good quality.  

Anyone knows if so link where you got the info from.
