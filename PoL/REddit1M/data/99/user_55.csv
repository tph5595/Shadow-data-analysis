From previous experiences with fire emblem limited edition I just know it will be sold out the moment its gets online. Maybe I could try and order from a different country."

I'm slowlycoming to terms with not getting limited edition and being content with spending less money and just pirating the soundtrack. Now to decide if I should get Switch just for the slightly better performance."
