39124,"I woke up at 6 this morning and preordered the game and system, not knowing this was an option. I am devastated that I missed out. I hope more stock will become available in the future."
73749,"I want to agree, I really do, but this really sours my experience with the switch right on the heels of the presentation. I got a special edition ordered, but I really wanted the whole kit. I want the statue to go on my shelf with my other collectibles, as I'm sure many others do. My pieces of plastic mean something to me. Something like this should be available in a much greater quantity. There's no reason for them to offer a quantity so low it is near impossible for an average person to obtain one."

I woke up at 6 am, caught the preorder for the console and a copy of Zelda, and thought I was good. I didn't even find out about the Master Edition until later that day when a friend was in line at GameStop at 10 am and texted me about it. I opted not to go to GameStop because I already had my console and thought I had everything secured. Had they announced the Master Edition in advance I would have planned ahead to put in the work to get one. Your argument that I didn't put any work in doesn't apply when so many people weren't even aware of its existence until after it was completely sold out. "
