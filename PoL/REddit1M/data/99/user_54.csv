29753,"I'm extremely sad the Limited Edition in Europe doesn't have the coin or the case, those are the things I wanted the most, beside the super cool box. I'm going to get the normal edition due to Nintendo's poor judgment."
43349,"Right, but I'm going to get the European edition to have the option to change language from English to Italian and I also prefer the UK localisation. The time I saw Splatoon's US version I cringed severely.

I guess I'll have to wait for some retailer or seller importing the single items, the case is the very least I'd like to get my hands on, the black box being the second."
56597,"Nothing wrong, but check the [comparison between the US translation and the UK localisation](http://splatoonwiki.org/wiki/Regional_Differences), you'll see there are many differences. Obviously, as a British English speaker I'll find the US English version peculiar and as a US English speaker an American will find the UK version pretty normal or somewhat lacking. There isn't an awful lot of text in Splatoon, but just looking at [DJ Octavio's puns](https://www.reddit.com/r/splatoon/comments/394gns/spoilers_final_boss_regional_dialogue_differences/) should do the job =)"
56678,I actually didn't know that Australia got the whole PAL package! I though they received the UK localised version stripped out of the other languages!
58273,"Well, I can see what you mean, though the continent is still the size of Europe! With the Switch being region free and not knowing if the Master Edition will be retailer specific or if it will ship to Italy I might just have to wait and see what will be sold there. I wonder if someone could safely ship it to me after buying it, if there's no direct way of ordering it from here!"
