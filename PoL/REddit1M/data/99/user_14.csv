EDIT: [""Buy Physical""](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-master-edition-switch) just shows an embarrassed looking Wario. And their switch [Buy Now](http://www.nintendo.com/switch/buy-now/) page has no actual links to purchase.

EDIT2: I stand corrected. The website is fully Wario. Before it at least was a product page with a broken Buy Physical link.

EDIT3: My heart is being torn. Its back now but the buy link is still broken."
