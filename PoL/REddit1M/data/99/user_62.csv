Personally I just want the pouch. Everything else is extra."
49757,That just means it's sold out
166483,"Special edition is still available on Best Buy. If you have GCU you get 20%.

It might be infuriating, but down the line I'm sure you won't be disappointed. The only difference is just the statue. I personally feel the rest (case, map, ost) are much more interesting."

320471,Uh.. what do you get then? That sounds really lame.. :/
