49987,This is sold out practically everywhere and the only version available is one store has the special edition (no master sword) should i get that one while i can? Or should i wait for the chance to maybe get the master edition and risk not getting either
55427,"Good advice, thank you! I got my special edition pre-ordered through best buy so hopefully the master edition goes back up on amazon, best buy or gamestop before release"
