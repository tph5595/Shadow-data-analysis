46502,"For other Nintendo consoles at least, the Australian version IS the Europe version. Australia is just part of 'Europe' as far as Nintendo's regionalisation goes. Copies of Wii/WiiU games bought in Australia have the same language options etc. as EU (typically English, German, Italian etc.)"
57871,Nope we are too small a market to be our own region. We are literally the EU console and games with an Australian power plug and slightly different boxes/covers to accommodate the Australian ratings instead of PEGI/ESRB. Makes sense - we are 230V 50 Hz PAL just like the UK.
