126696,To anyone that actually wants the statue but doesn't want to pay scalper prices I suggest getting the US Special edition and then the UK Special edition.  It costs more than our masters all together but you get the sword from the UK Version.  Then you can either sell the game or do whatever to recoup some of the cost.   This is the only option I found to have all the pieces of our master set.
