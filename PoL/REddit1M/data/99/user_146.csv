292389,"Dude I love you! After losing out on the master edition but at least getting a pre order for the special edition I've been scrambling to try and find a decently priced master edition on ebay but they're literally all going for $400+ which is insane. Just preordered the UK special edition from amazon so all in all I got the entire masters edition set for around $200 and like you said I'll have an extra game and cd I can sell. Seriously dude can't thank you enough you saved me a bunch of money cause I was probably gonna cave and buy a masters from one of the scalpers. You should make a post about this, I'm sure a bunch of people don't know about this just like me and you'll get some sweet sweet karma :)"
