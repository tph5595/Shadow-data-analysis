50904,"The Special edition is up on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N224U9S/) right now.

And it's up on [Best Buy](http://www.bestbuy.com/site/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-special-edition-nintendo-switch/5730400.p?skuId=5730400) (if you have GCU and want that sweet, sweet discount).

(not the Master Edition, I'm afraid)"
51686,"Order the Special Edition while you can. You still have well over a month to cancel the order, should you get the Master Edition by then.

That's what I did. I'm still holding out hope for the Master Edition, but I locked in a Special Edition order on Amazon regardless."
51742,"I hope that's just an error, and they fix it soon."
51910,"Someone probably mistyped the information, I guess?"
53447,"Europe only gets the Special Edition, not the Master Edition. The only difference is the Master Sword statue, but still, it's annoying that Nintendo gives certain editions to certain regions. (That said, the Switch is region-unlocked, so if you can snag a US order, it'll still work on a EU Switch.)"
