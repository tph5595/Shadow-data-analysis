53093,Can't even find it in any Norwegian shops... FML! :'(
288661,"Thanks :)

And crap... they always do this stuff :( I'd love to get the Master Edition, but if I order from the US, the cost would double because of Norway's retarded customs fees.

I actually have it Pre-ordered from Amazon.co.uk (it has game + sword + cd), but I bet the customs will make it really expensive (even if it's a game and should go free). So I'll check some stored in Norway and cancel if necessary."
