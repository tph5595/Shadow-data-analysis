EDIT FOR CHAT:

12:44 AM PST Rabi(Amazon): Hello Maros128 , my name is Rabi. I'm here to help you today.

12:45 AM PST Maros128: Hi

12:45 AM PST Rabi: May I know the item you like to purchase?

12:45 AM PST Maros128: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MT8SWKC/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484296323&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=breath+of+the+wild+master+edition

12:47 AM PST Rabi: Are you referring that the link you provided and the item in your order are different?

12:48 AM PST Maros128: Yes
I went to that link and selected pre-order and purchased the item but my order is showing for a seperate version

12:49 AM PST Maros128: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01N224U9S/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484297344&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=breath+of+the+wild+special+edition 
This is the item I ended up with

12:50 AM PST Maros128: ORDER # [redacted]

12:50 AM PST Rabi: Okay, I can understand.

12:50 AM PST Maros128: I specifically clicked on the master edition link. And I have been waiting to purchase the item so I didn't lose out to scalpers so this has me a little upset

12:51 AM PST Rabi: In this case, you need to get Wild Master and when you purchase it is Wild Special .
Am I right?
12:51 AM PST Maros128: yes

12:53 AM PST Rabi: For your information, Wild master not yet opened for Pre-order and It seems that order was placed to wild special edition, In this case shall U cancel the order and email you once the wild master edition comes for pre-order?

*For your information, Wild master not yet opened for Pre-order and It seems that order was placed to wild special edition, In this case shall I cancel the order and email you once the wild master edition comes for pre-order?
12:55 AM PST Maros128: Is there a time for when it does go available? Because I don't want to end up missing out because i'm waiting for a delayed email and then it selling out

12:56 AM PST Rabi: No worries, I've created follow up personally and email you once the item is ready for pre-order and so you can access the item for per-order and place the order for the right item?&gt;

12:57 AM PST Maros128: But will that guarantee me the item? Because I am in a lot of pain as I had oral surgery done yesterday afternoon and it's quite taxing for me to remain awake to make sure that I can get this.

12:58 AM PST Rabi: Sure, you'll get this item for sure, Louie.

12:59 AM PST Maros128: I Thought I had already purchased it since when i had refreshed at one point i was given the option to pre-order. and when I pressed the backwards navigation I received the notification ""Important messages about items in your Cart:
We're sorry. The item The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild Master Edition - Switch is no longer available from the seller you selected. To see if it's available from another seller, click here to return to the item's product detail page.""

01:01 AM PST Rabi: I can understand, so once the item is available (Wild Master) I'll send you a confirmation email and your welcome to place a new order.

01:01 AM PST Maros128: thank you

01:01 AM PST Rabi: If you prefer I can help you in cancelling this order,Louie. 

01:02 AM PST Maros128: I would actually prefer to cancel this order after I have for sure received confirmation that I have purchased the Master Edition of the game.

01:02 AM PST Rabi: Okay.

01:03 AM PST Rabi: It would be my utmost pleasure if there is anything else I can do for you today?

01:04 AM PST Maros128: As long as i have your assurance that will be all. Thank you so much for all of you help

01:04 AM PST Rabi: Youâ€™re very welcome.
Thank you for the patience and understanding.
