49930,I have been refreshing Best Buy ALL morning...I finally broke down to go eat...and whadya flippen know?  It goes up and sells outs in the 45 minutes I leave...cant believe it
50539,"I did enjoy the food lol...when I got back I was disillusioned, it let me add to cart, sometimes choose shipping/sometimes only store pickup...either it would reject (any) address or when I chose it store said not available in 250+ miles.  I must have just missed the 15 minute window.  Tried over and over again until it said sold out/greyed out.  "
