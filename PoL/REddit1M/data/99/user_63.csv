37173," Well fuck me for needing to go to work, right? Whatever, I got the Special Edition at least..."
53874,"&gt;Plus, there's always the small chance there will be a second wave. Not that I'm trying to get anyone's hopes up.

I don't know about that, during the Treehouse Live event Reggie came on and said (and I quote) ""when they're gone, they're gone"""
55667,Most do. Best Buy failed to authorize my Switch pre-order last night because I accidentally had a card that expired as my default. It didn't let me update Paypal but it let me change to a card payment method and enter a new credit card. Similarly Amazon has in the past allowed me to update a payment method if something failed. Keep in mind though since these are limited that might bump you to the back of the line if you wait too long.
55779,"Don't get too upset. I was around and trying to order it, every time it showed in stock I'd add it to my card and try to check out, only to have it go back out of stock before I could complete my order. this happened about a dozen times before it finally read ""sold out"" again. I was so pissed, TWELVE TIMES I thought I had it, only to have my hopes crushed by the ""We're sorry, this item is no longer available"" message...."
61085,I hope slim to none. I switched my Special Edition preorder from Gamestop to Best Buy because with that and the amiibos it was cheaper for me to sign up for their 20% off club or whatever. I'd be pissed if even ONE of those 7 things winds up cancelled.
61154,[Nintendo's website only lists those three as authorized retailers at the moment.](http://prntscr.com/dvcbzg)
61278,"I gave up after 8 hours of refreshing all three retailer sites. I had the Best Buy one *supposedly* go back in stock almost 2 dozen times during that timeframe, but now it's just been sitting at ""sold out"" for too long and I'm sick of the false positives. I'm done, the plastic sword and plain black box just isn't worth it to me to keep looking, if Nintendo doesn't want my extra $30 then so be it..."
