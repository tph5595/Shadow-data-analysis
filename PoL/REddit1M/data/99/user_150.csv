It's bad for those fans (like me) that supported Nintendo with the WiiU with the promise of a Zelda game, they didn't gave a shit about it and then they release the Switch edition and you can get the fucking console or the game. It's an insult for those loyal fans that have being waiting for years for this game. I personally not gonna buy a fucking Switch nor Zelda until the prices drops a lot (probably 2-3 years). You can go fuck your self Nintendo."
