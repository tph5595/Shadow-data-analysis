44793,as far as I know Game Stop sold thru instantly. I think Best Buy is the only potential option now for us :(
46244,BEST BUY IS UP JUST GOT ONE
60410,What are the chances best buy cancels some of the pre-orders of the master edition? Haven't they had issues with doing that in the past? I hope they don't screw me cause I canceled my special edition once I acquired their master edition.
