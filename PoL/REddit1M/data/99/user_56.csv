30798,"I missed the Master Edition. I do have a preorder for the special edition though (via Gamestop), which I can cancel once I get the Master edition preorder if it pops back up. I want that Sword (pronounced S-Word).

I did manage to get my preorders in for the BOTW Amiibos.
(Via Best Buy)

I have all of the LOZ Amiibos:
* Shiek
* Ganondorf
* Zelda
* Link
* Toon Link
* Midna
* 30th anniversary 8-Bit Link
* 30th anniversary OOT Link
* 30th anniversary Toon Link
* 30th anniversary Toon Zelda
* BOTW Guardian (Bestbuy Preorder)
* BOTW Zelda  (Bestbuy Preorder)
* BOTW Archer  (Bestbuy Preorder)
* BOTW Rider  (Bestbuy Preorder)
* BOTW Bokoblin  (Bestbuy Preorder)

I do not have those limited edition recolors though. Not like they do anything special."
