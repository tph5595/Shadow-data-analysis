50224,Get the special edition now. You can always cancel and order the master edition
50402,"Your absolutely right sir. I was waiting on Best Buy allll day. Went in 3  minutes. Did I get one? No. So I got the special edition. Prettier box art and the ONLY thing you miss is a sword. If your that desperate for it, I'm sure someone will sell it as a standalone thing on eBay months from now when it releases. Plus, there's always the small chance there will be a second wave. Not that I'm trying to get anyone's hopes up."
