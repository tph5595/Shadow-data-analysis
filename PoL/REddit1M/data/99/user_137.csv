93178,Fucking scalpers dammit. I can't even pre order the special edition off GameStop online. I checked eBay and the master edition preorders are already selling anywhere from $300 to over $1000 plus. Why can't assholes just let the people who actually appreciate the games just buy them. Always about a fucking profit.
