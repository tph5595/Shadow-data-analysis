24003,Who cried over Fi? I was annoyed she didn't leave earlier.
24099,That game is the reason most of the people who talk about zelda talk about zelda. If the first zelda game you had ever played was skyward sword would you really have bothered to keep bring it up? I sure as hell wouldn't.
24152,You.....you are broken inside.
24419,It's a good game with way too much standing between the player and the game experience. Stacked up to either OoT or LttP it pales in comparison.
28982,"Fi will interrupt you without you acknowledging her presence to tell you information you've heard the same way a hundred times before. Even the simplest version of the hud is too busy, and the answers to puzzles are dished out to you. 

In OoT Navi only ever spoke if you were looking at something you'd never seen before or if you prompted her to. Yes, she often interrupted game audio with 'hey listen' but if you ignored her she would leave you alone. "

As for the hud, regardless of information, Link to the Past has the smallest hud relative to the display. "
