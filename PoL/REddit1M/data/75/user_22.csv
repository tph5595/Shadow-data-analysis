That scene was insane, but I feel that it would've been more effective if Fi had a bit of development during the game. She is the Master Sword after all - the basis of the story. 

With that said, I can argue that having her robotic the entire game made that *one* moment of emotion much more effective than it would have been otherwise. 

I guess one can argue for both sides, but what I know for sure is that I much prefer Midna as a partner. "

And I also liked SS more than TP. "

unless you're conquering something...

The updated sword fighting was the really big thing that made me love it. 8 directions to swing in made enemy battle designs so much cooler, and made battles feel kind of like puzzles more often. And the last dungeon was unbelievably good. "
