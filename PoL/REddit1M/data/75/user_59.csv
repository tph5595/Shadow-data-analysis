115097,"So far I've beaten every canon Zelda game (AKA every one on the timeline) except for Zelda, Zelda II, Minish Cap, and Four Swords Adventures (and I've at least briefly played all of them except FSA). And while there are definitely entries I liked more than others, as well as some that I had a lot of problems with, but I don't think I ever played one that I truly hated."
