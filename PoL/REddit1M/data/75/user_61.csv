122656,I still remember when every one hated the hell out of WW. Now things are going a bit better for it. I even saw 3 people say it's the best zelda game ever today without anyone telling them it sucks because of the fetch quest and sailing
122716,I noticed this too. In the beginning she was more robotic and only cared about her goal. Then she started to be more human
122738,I liked it but didn't love it. 
122772,"I also enjoyed them all too, you're not alone. Well all except Links awakening, I really hate that game"
122846,"It's because they are talking about how everyone use to hate it and you are seeing how everyone currently likes it. It was my favourite from the beginning and I don't know how people hated it, I played it 3 times right after each other when it came out because I liked it so much "
122947,Or how the items are never used outside of the dungeon. It happens with every zelda game but apparently TP did it too so it's literally hitler
122961,They all had problems
122998,Way before that. It happened with Zelda 2
123113,This happened with SKyward sword too. Tons of threads about what they want to see and what would be cool in this game. Then it came out and it was lack luster to their impossible expectations
