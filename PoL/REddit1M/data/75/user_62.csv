140735,"I think OoT still probably holds the title for ""most people who says it's the best."" I was one of those people from its release, but SS came in and blew me away. First time I've ever cried in a video game. Yes, Fi was annoying, but the story telling, the game controls, and the art style all culminated in one of the most beautiful gaming experiences I've ever had the grace to participate in. 

I also love Windwaker and Majora's mask. Still getting through ALttP, but being that I was born in '93, I'm a tad spoiled with technology and modern gaming. Old platformers are hard. ):"
