30183,"Everyone loves Twilight Princess *now*, but when it was released the hate for it rivaled, and I would almost go as far as to say that it may have surpassed, the hate Skyward Sword has now. I remember people used to point toward OoT, then point to TP and say: These to games are very similar, therefore this series has not changed at all since the N64 era and therefore has grown *DISGUSTINGLY* stagnant and if you dare to like Twilight Princess you are supporting the death of creativity in this medium (because apparently, there were no Zelda games released between OoT and TP).

People hated it for other reasons too, like how the overworld was just a big empty void just there to pad out the game length, which was a similar criticism leveled against Wind Waker. Which is kinda ironic considering how everyone loves TP and WW now and hates SS because (among other things) the overworld is too small.     "
