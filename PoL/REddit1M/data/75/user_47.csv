58680,"Why does this cycle resonate so well with me?

Although, I really doubt I can recognize Skyward Sword as an ""outdated classic"" in a few years time. As underwhelming as Twilight Princess was I still managed to replay it about 5 times and still enjoy it. With Skyward Sword? I don't even want to play that a second time. Just the plot, sometimes forced motion controls, horrible artstyle, Fi, boring flights, and such just drive me away from ever replaying it a second time.

I'm even more skeptical about the next new Zelda...as I'm really not feeling a Link Between Worlds.

As annoying as she was ingame, she stuck by Link at the very beginning of the game towards the final fight with Ganon. Fi on the other hand, just felt like she was forced as your companion. The story didn't give enough of a reason for me to care about Fi's departure at all. 

tl:dr If Navi made me care about her way more than Fi, than that is saying something "
