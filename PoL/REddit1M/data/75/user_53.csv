90052,"the cycle pertains to the Zelda series once there were enough games to fill in the cycle. the order is chronological (release date), so, of course it works in this order. People won't hate Wind Waker then proceed to say that the as yet unreleased Zelda U is the best game ever. No, they will say that Zelda U sucks because it lost something vital to the series and/or it was hard to play (because of controls) and proceed to say that WW is great because it is classic."
