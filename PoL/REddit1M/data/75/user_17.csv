How the hell did Nintendo create a companion that was hated by many for her hand-holding, but still made about 95% of players bawl their eyes out when she leaves at the end?! That's freaking unbelievable!

EDIT: I've lost my faith in all of you!"

Despite her nagging, she was a MUCH better story element than Navi ever was, who was just...well, there to help you lock on. Fi's story is also the Master Sword's story, and her singing and dancing were always intriguing to watch.

When Navi left, I was like, ""Oh, I guess it's time to part ways. Alright then."" With Fi, I legitimately became sad and it was an extremely bittersweet ending to me for that. Despite all of the annoyances, I grew close to her, especially as a character. So when she left, I felt like a hole just opened up.

tl;dr - It works the other way too. If Fi's departure made me care more than Navi's did, then that is saying a lot."
