A robot doesn't grow a personality in a few weeks.  Ghirahim had a thousand years to develop his persona.  Fi's was just starting to appear by the end of Skyward Sword."
23212,"Nah, I love them all.  Adventure of Link is a blast if you're in the right mood for it, and I really enjoy the concept of the Temple of the Ocean King."
23255,Mostly because 90% of the people who talk about Zelda have only played that one.
23597,"saihenjin didn't say anything about whether she was boring or not, he said they didn't develop her character during the game."
24297,"Well, I would, because Skyward Sword is phenomenal.  It replaced my *real* first, Wind Waker (I'd played others before it, but it was the first one I really got into &amp; the first one I beat), as my favorite."
24502,"What is standing between the player and the game?

Fi only talks as much as Navi ever did, and the controls are perfect 90% of the time.  Is having to press down on the d-pad every so often really that much of a dealbreaker for you?"
24731,"Not to mention the flawless cinematic direction and music.

I have no hate and quite a lot of love for Fi, myself."
24848,"I really don't know where this meme of Fi being overhelpful came from, because I never noticed it on my three playthroughs."
25045,"I think it's pretty accurate, though we still haven't gotten past the undying worship of OoT.  I think it belongs as ""outdated classic"" personally."

Meanwhile Ocarina of Time has six buttons laid across the screen and A Link to the Past has all your ammunition listed.

And can you give me an example of Fi interrupting you or the answers to puzzle being ""handed to you""?  Because I don't recall seeing a single one of those after the first dungeon."
33430,Have you even played Skyward Sword?  That's not Fi.  That's the game menu.  Not a character.
