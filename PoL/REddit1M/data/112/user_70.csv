76343,"So I just found the lost woods and was trying to find a way to actually walk through them properly.

As I failed to find a way for the second part ( [I'd follow the torchs for the first part but then reach a point with two torchs and nothing else](/spoiler) ), I wanted to look into it more - without looking for an explicit solution on the internet (where's the fun otherwise!)

So simply put - is there a way in the game to learn more about what the lost woods are (since I just literally happened to find them randomly lol), or am I supposed to figure out how to browse them by myself? The only mention of the lost woods I've seen in the game so far was [some random guy saying the Master Sword is supposedly hidden there](/spoiler)

Thank you!"

I'll try to dig deeper in that :D"

Thanks :P"
