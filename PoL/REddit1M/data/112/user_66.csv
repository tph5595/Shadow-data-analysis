55060,"Find a wooden shield (most stables and towns have pot lids that will work in a pinch). Then find an enemy that is shooting regular arrows. Stand there with your shield raised, he will continually shoot arrows into your shield. You can then just collect them right there. You can also get him to fire and miss you, then find the arrow in the grass (this can be a pain in the ass though).  
  
FWIW, I never did much arrow farming and never bought any arrows. About 50 hours into the game now and I have more arrows than I can ever imagine using."
