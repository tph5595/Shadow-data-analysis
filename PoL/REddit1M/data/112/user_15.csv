9256,Have any tips on zeroing in on the lanayru ruins one? I went either too far or not far enough and could not spot it for the life of me. 
9566,"No, its like the champion powers, you need to use it all the way up to recharge. "
9606,Is there any resource for all the material requirements for upgrades? 
9672,Alright. I wish you could rotate the pictures 360 degrees to get a better bearing. 
12778,"I know this has been asked to death, but can I get some help with where to find the goron for tarrey town?"
13239,thank you!
15717,"Sweet, thank you!"
15745,"Thank you! I think that should help, I took an odd way to Goron city the first time so I think I didn't meet half the NPC's. "
92582,Yeah I'm with you. I just try to demolish it once I start using it and have some guardian weapons on retainer in case I'm fighting some walkers with a broken master sword.
