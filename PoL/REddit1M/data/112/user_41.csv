Essentially this means you'll be farming Silver Lynels to upgrade your armor rather than easier Lynels. But it also means that it's hard to find the simpler weapons for your compendium photos, as all your monsters will be higher level, so they'll carry the better weapons, so the lower level weapons won't exist as monster kills anymore, and you'll have to look up overworld spawn locations for those weapons."

As you get better at combat, you'll fight guardians differently [by chopping off legs &amp; arrows to the eye to stun](/spoiler) but I fought my first guardians with the tips from that shrine."
