At the early game most weapons have low power and low durability, but later on in the game you will start finding stronger weapons with higher durability. I got to the point where my issue is I keep finding good weapons but my inventory is full of equally good weapons with full durability.

Also a hint: when looking at your inventory, items that sparkle in the top right corner are at full ""health"". It's a good idea to keep track of what weapons haven't been used yet, if you ever need to throw something away to pick up something else.   "

Those encounters are so annoying..i don't mind the sword guys bevause they're fun to fight and you get a decent sword, but the archer guys are annoying to fight and are hard to escape from. Plus their bow sucks."
11905,The latter. 
11981,"I'm not sure how much, but it should stack. Wouldn't make sense why it shouldn't stack. 

I've using stacking stealth bonuses with the sheikah armor, so I hope that it's actually stacking lol"

Just kiddin. I'm not sure exactly if anywhere in game teaches how to fight them, but I'll say there is a specific research lab that will help you better prepare yourself for them."
48076,Sometimes I just want to be able to run pass then like i can most basic enemies. But they keep up for a good while with their teleporting. 
51130,"Yea the archer guys have a better item drop, but I enjoy fighting the big guys. Generally what I do is save the wind blade to fight him, then when I beat him I take the new wind blade and drop my old one. And the cycle begins anew."
63797,"Pretty sure 1 second irl is 1 minute in-game. 

Might be slightly longer, but the clock on your map only shows like 2:00 then goes to 2:05 then 2:10 and so on, so it's hard to tell for sure.  "
76714,"Man I always forget about stasis unless I'm fighting a mini boss or a lynel. I'm gonna use that on them from now on. Thanks

Edit: nice username btw "
