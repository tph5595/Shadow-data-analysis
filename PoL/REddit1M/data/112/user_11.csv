8397,"**2 Questions**:

1) Armour Upgrades: You get the special bonus from them by being 2-Star? So, does the 3-Star armour have the same ""special effect?"" Or the effect gets ""stronger""? (example: Barbarian armour increases attack. Does the attack increase differ from 2-Star and 3-Star?

2) What's the best armour for lowest damage taken? What's the debate in Champion's Tunic and the Soldier Set?"
9828,"so practically, if one has the amber earings, champion's tunic and an appropriate pair of shoes, he has the max defence?

thanks for the help! :)"
