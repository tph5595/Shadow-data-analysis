Upgrading armor requires you to see the fairy cutscene over an over (you can skip part of it, but each cycles still takes a while). Same with cooking. Really annoying, especially because Nintendo already learned the lesson of how annoying this can be when WWHD was released (repeatedly changing the wind direction is a lot faster)."
