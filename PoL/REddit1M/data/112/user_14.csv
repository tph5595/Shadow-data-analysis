9205,"So which shrines require you to beat the Divine Beasts? I had planned to do all 120 shrines before starting the main quest, but I heard a few can only be done after the Main Quest is done. Which ones require defeating Divine Beasts?"
11743,Thanks! I'm surprised I haven't gotten a solid answer on this yet. I've heard there's maybe 4 shrines that require you to defeat the region-specific Divine Beast but results have varied. At some point I'll get an answer.
17221,Yeah I felt the same way. I wanted to be OP when I went in to fight them. No such luck.
