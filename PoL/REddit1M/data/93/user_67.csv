37599,Btw there’s extra dialog if you beat the beasts a second time 
37813,"Btw you have to kill *every* camp guy for the shrine to appear. 

Best tip I got for the forest challenge is use a bomb arrow on those keese so they’ll go away before attacking the camp. Also watch out for bees/hives "
38003,There’s armor you get with the DLC that you can discover before finishing the the divine beast quest or finding the master sword that you might find useful early in the game. You can’t upgrade them but they look cool and some have buffs. If you have 20 bucks to spare I say go for it 
45276,In the DLC you can fight them as many times as you want. The first for the champions ballad gives you a new memory. The second gives you extra dialog from the champions. It’s just an extra bit that reveals a little more personality 
49732,well that's kinda lame. May as well play the cut scenes to the whole game and not play it at all
