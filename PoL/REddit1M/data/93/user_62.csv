39995,"It's not like you are gonna do anything else with em anyways. I used them on mounted enemies and moblins, and anything else I didn't want to deal with up close and personal."
40207,"Heck the only reason I often held back from using them was not because of the fact that I was lacking the ability to get them, but because I wanted the loot monsters dropped more. Using one on a Lynel = No Bow For Me. "
41618,Or Star Pieces! Even if the drop rate is low from Silver Lynels.... I still don't wanna give up the chance!
42580,"I don't know why, but even when I do stuff like that, they just don't drop all the time. Same thing with the dragons."
42643,"I only had about 30, but I had lots of elemental arrows to, and plenty of normal arrows... The Obliterator was more of a panic button than anything else."
44996,"I don't know why, but these kinds of things are always so finicky in my game."
67278,"Like, just the other day I was trying to get Naydra Horns, and I went to the same spot I went to on other playthroughs, and Naydra just wouldn't show up, despite it working earlier. I just think the dragons don't like me, unless they happened to be named Farosh."
