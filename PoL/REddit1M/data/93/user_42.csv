24071,"SPOILERS:

The Yiga Clan killed Cottla and Koko's mom, Dorian's wife.

Their lives are ALL forfeit.  I will hunt them to the ends of the earth if I have to, you hear me, TO THE ENDS OF THE EARTH!!!

(I wanted to say to the ends of Hyrule, but it's pretty clear that there is stuff beyond the ends of Hyrule, you know, with the mountains in the distance and the ocean extending out and all that jazz. :) )"
52493,"What's maybe even more horrible is that according to my memory, this happened RECENTLY.  They did it because they wanted information about YOU waking up, so between the time when you wake at the beginning of the game, and do the whole tutorial on the great plateau (alerting the world to your existence), the Yiga Clan decides it needs a source in Kakariko Village and kills Dorian's wife (Dorian is a former Yiga, so they knew where he was and how to pressure him - he left the Yiga because he met his wife) - all in order to have an inside informant on YOUR movements.

Cottla goes on and on about how her mother is ""hiding,"" somewhere.  Because Dorian's wife and her mother is... well... yeah.  She's dead, but Cottla doesn't know yet.  This is the same kid you get little prizes from when you play tag or hide and seek.

&lt;Fordrus's eyes begin to visibly water&gt;
Who the heck is cutting onions at this time of night?  Jeeze, the NERVE of some people!

Now let's go murder some Yiga bastards."
52697,"I darn well hope we killed him!  See my note above: the Yiga clan killed Dorian's wife, Koko and Cottla's mother.  Cottla doesn't even know yet, she thinks ""mommy is hiding somewhere.""  They did it to pressure Dorian into providing information about Link's movements.

Heartless pieces of bokoblin excrement, death is really too good for them, but I'll settle for death for now and do the whole resurrection/torture thing later if I decide I want to swing it that way."
53470,"I'm tempted to go and taunt this bot, because you can pull my darn from my cold, dead hands, damnit. ;) :D "
56744,"Yes, so mysterious, the deaths of the Yiga, who knows how they happen?  They just start spasming 7-10 times and then die!  YOU CAN'T EXPLAIN THAT!!! :D"
134228,"That's fair, I played Seasons and Ages, but I never did the connecting thing, and Link's Awakening trained me to treat the GameBoy games as alternate universe/dreamstate storylines.  Not exactly fair to the gameboy games or perfectly rational, but there it is. :) :D"
