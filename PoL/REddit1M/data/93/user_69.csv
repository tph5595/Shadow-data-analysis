39290,I could see it in a game like skyrim because the trigger is the right one and you control hands separately but I don't see the logic for Zelda. 
39386,Ancient arrows are relatively cheap by that point any way. You can just go and grind out some ancient parts. 
39432,Yeah. I rushed the phantom armor and it was super useful early game. 
40039,Yeah they become much easier to acquire as you progress. 
41079,Or guts to upgrade armor!
42044,Follow [this](https://www.polygon.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-guide-walkthrough/2017/6/1/15723474/star-fragments-find-use-location) works everytime for me. 
43956,"Weird. Everytime I've tried it, it's worked ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"
59539,"Well yeah that would make more sense if the attack button was the trigger but it isn't. In fact, it's the left button. "
59948,"Try following the guide very closely, you could be just missing something. That, or Hylia is not on your side lol"
60103,"True, I think the point I'm making is, I don't think switching him to be a left would really matter. Like, as long as you explain the controls, I don't really think it would change anything. To be honest, I didn't know he was a lefty in older games because I've never played any others but it's kind of a neat little detail. "
