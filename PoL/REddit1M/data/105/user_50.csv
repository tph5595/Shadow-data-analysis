It's tiring when people let themselves get unreasonably hyped up, only to complain when the game isn't exactly what they wanted it to be. From what I recall, Twilight Princess was initially not that well received after people treated it as the Second Coming of ~~Jesus~~ Ocarina of Time and found themselves disappointed, but now it seems to be spoken about in a neutral or positive light (just to be clear, I liked Twilight Princess). I expect the same thing to happen to Skyward Sword at some point, though the motion controls might hold it back a bit longer (for the record, I never had a problem with the controls)."
