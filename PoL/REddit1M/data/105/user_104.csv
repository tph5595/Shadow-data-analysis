Especially the Elder Scrolls ones, unlike fallout, aren't really that good at showcasing the main story and characters, which is one of the greatest things about zelda imo.

That said, a bunch of zelda-esque sidequests, in a large but **memorable** open world - unlike Elder Scrolls, where it gets so expansive that all the forests and grasslands and such start to blend together and you probably couldn't even recognize some of the smaller locations if I posted a screenshot - sounds amazing."

On the other hand, You could show me a screenshot of any location in any 3D zelda game, and I'd probably know where it is. I'd be willing to bet the same is true of many people who've completed whatever game it is you're taking the screenshot from. Its not guarenteed they'd know it, of course, but there's a significant chance that even a casual player would have the opportunity and reason to explore most areas of a zelda map, even the ones intended to be secret. For skyrim theres probably less than a 1% chance that any casual player would recognize a random bandit camp tucked away in a far corner of the map, whereas they might recognize the cliffs under eldin bridge, or Windwaker's Ice Island, or a specific cave somewhere.

Don't get me wrong, I don't dislike TES. I've played quite a lot of it, its just those characteristics are not what I'd want to see in a zelda game.

Edit: I understand that I'm arguing a difference of degree rather than a difference of type, so it can be hard to define exactly where the line is between the two, but I still think its a change that zelda is better off without."
