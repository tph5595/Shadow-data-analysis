29768,I disagree. Most of those radiant quests are pretty boring but most of the handcrafted side quests were great.

Also, bugs aren't even relevant in this discussion, we were just talking about the quality of the side quests. And either way, Zelda has had game breaking quest bugs as well, so it's not a fair point.

For what it's worth, I'm a long time fan of Zelda and TES. Both are incredible for different reasons, and in my eyes, they're both the best at what they do in my opinion."
44218,"I agree, and I love that type of tale. I just don't understand why it would be okay for Zelda to use those ideas and not for Skyrim to do so.

And by the way, you may be in luck! I'm sure you know about WINE but it is possible to get it to run through that. If you don't want to fumble around with it, then keep an eye out for OpenMW. It's got a ways to go but it's already quite playable to my understanding, it requires the Morrowind data files to run so you still need to own it and have it installed, but I believe OpenMW is Linux compatible right from the bat. Don't quote me on that though, I've never tried to run Morrowind on my Linux installs."
45102,"That's true, I haven't come close to beating it yet though I have a fair amount of hours in it. It's a great game though.

As for Skyrim, personally Oblivion was actually my favorite of the bunch, but I do really love Skyrim. It does definitely have a couple weak quests (with as many quests as it has though, that's hardly a surprise nor a disappointment in my opinion) but that's not the beauty of the game anyway. It's about the exploration and role playing, to me.

Also, side note, I thought the item renting was pretty cool. I prefer the tried and true method, though that still existed in its own way. I am not very far into the game yet, but I thought it was a great way of making a handheld Zelda easily approachable. A large portion of the handheld audience wants to be able to play a game for 30 minutes, and Nintendo knows it."
105307,"That's simply false, there was a major one just a couple years ago with Skyward Sword. And I never said that AAA games get a free pass, I'm not sure why you're bringing that up."
105593,"Indeed, it was cool of them to actually fix the issue. But Bethesda has fixed pretty much every potentially game breaking bug in Skyrim, and it's much easier to get the patch for that game. All you really have to do is start the game up and be connected to the internet, and you'd never even know about it.

I'm not trying to rag on Zelda, I love Zelda, probably more than TES though it's hard for me to say. They're both amazing, one doesn't have to be worse for the other to be amazing."
133469,"That's a totally subjective matter though. I, and many others, think it's amazing and I don't find it to be shallow at all. Yes, there is a lot of ""okay"" content, but there's a lot of excellent content as well. It has a lot more going for it than just being big."
