42823,"I like comparing the sound used during each of the games as an example of the evolution. Take Link's gasp of pain for instance. Up until Ocarina of Time it was merely a blip, a single blip usually shorter than 1/3 of a second. Ocarina of Time brought in the capability to try all sorts of new things, and the added space allowed them to really bring in featured sounds. You can admire the sound evolution yourself [here](http://noproblo.dayjo.org/ZeldaSounds/). Explore with the search bar, you'll find sounds that are similarly named across all the games."

The OoT wrong warp was great, I never really delved into other Zelda games' mechanics though. The infinite swimming in WW was fun.

I really wish I could run TES:Morrowind on linux."
44479,"I've run across it but it was a bit large to digest in one sitting so I put it aside back then. Maybe come fall I'll enter into the fray and make the purchase, I'm aware of a few places you can buy the game from DRM free, I just haven't bothered to do it.

I don't see why any franchise should be incapable of doing something because of the actions of another. As long as the creators are capable of making something fun and immersive I'm all for it. I'll be the first to point my pitchforks at them for fucking up though, I'm sure a lot of people would do the same.  

So far they've done a decent job with each game, I'm not big on the item renting but it's not the worst mechanic and they were trying to explore the concept which hopefully taught them what they needed to make the current game. Ah, I'm a bit reversed on the topic here but whatever, I wasn't a Skyrim person."
45552,It's definitely more approachable as a result which is a positive.
