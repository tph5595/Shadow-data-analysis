23623,"There were side quests in Zelda games before TES: Arena. Hell, there were quite a few games before TES games with side quests.

  So ""because Skyrim invented side quests amirite?""."
33176,"Majora's Mask had quite a few, but honestly people act like when it comes to open world/side quests/whathaveyou people default on Skyrim for some odd reason. And it's not like I'd brag about the majority of side quests in Oblivion and Skyrim. Outside of a few stellar guild quests/side quest lines (like Dark Brotherhood in Oblivion) they're all rather repetitive and boring.

  So Oblivion and Skyrim had a lot of side quests. So what? Why does ""more side quests"" have to equate Zelda to Skyrim? Why not Ultima? Wizardry? Planescape: Torment? Fallout?"
77852,"People still play P:T and Fallout. New Vegas is rather recent. And we also have other open world games with side quests like GTA, Dragon's Dogma, etc. It has nothing to do with being ""hipster"". The game series I mentioned were incredibly popular. It's not like I listed some obscure titles.

  &gt;The idea of them is repetitive, but the execution isn't.

  Did you play Skyrim? It had incredibly repetitive quests. ""Go here, oh no! SHOCK! DRAUGR! kill draugr"" or ""go here, kill these guys"" or ""go here, help kill these guys"" etc etc. They might as well have called it ""Dungeons &amp; Draugrs"".

  But I'm not here to critique Skyrim on all its flaws (but I will if you want me to, honestly the worst RPG I've played in a long time) I'm just curious as to why people feel it necessary to compare Zelda to Skyrim because of side quests. As if side quests are new to Zelda. Maybe it's a bit elitist, but it's like wondering why Akira Kurosawa films are like ""Westerns, but in Japan!""."
