I actually wouldn't be against that, I thought the ores in Skwyard Sword were a pretty neat way to add a bit of a level up system for your weapons, and with an open world, I'd hope they'd expand upon the idea. Only thing, I hope they remove the constant reminders that pop-up every time you pick up one of them. 

Interactions with characters and trading sequences that flesh out the world would be preferred, of course, particularly ones that last a long while that send you on fun journeys of fighting and exploring... But I'd also love the simpler secrets, like burning down a bush to find a hidden door."
