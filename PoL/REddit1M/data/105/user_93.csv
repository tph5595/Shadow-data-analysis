43413,"I hope by ""side-quests"" they don't mean the likes of those in games such as Skyrim. I just want a nice, dense world to explore. The Legend of Zelda needs to throw out its aspirations for epic narratives this time around and focus on telling the story through player-experience. Sure, certain details in the game could hold more significance than others, but stop with the linearity; we need more free form Zelda games. I'm really tired of cutscenes throughout Zelda games and the extremely predictable dungeon formula. Ideally I want cutscenes to bookend the game rather than mark every turning point. Also please, there needs to be a more refined combat system. Not to say that there hasn't been any good combat systems in Zelda games; Wind Waker had a fairly good one, but there was nothing that the game challenged you on to evolve the way you approached a confrontation. I guess that I'm sort of asking for a more approachable version of Dark Souls, but how would that not be awesome? Much of the Legend of Zelda revolves around the idea of discovery and that has been missing from recent Zelda titles. 

I hope side quests end up being chance encounters with deities or monsters, or something like stumbling across a cave or dungeon. I kind of doubt that it'll be that though; it'll probably just be ""Go pick 10 apples and feed them to the horses"" or ""There is a cave over there. Go get the treasure that's inside the cave."" 

Every time a game does the ""Go here, do this"" thing I'm immediately reminded that ""Oh yeah, this is a game."" I really don't want TLOZ to become a To-Do list.
