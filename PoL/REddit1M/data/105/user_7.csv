8494,hopefully it has the way more than all the other zelda games but still having the zelda quality.
22148,skyrim but without shit combat. 
22325,when I play a new installment I usually expect it to be better.
31110,Well I just recently got into Zelda games about a year ago with OOT being the first that I've played. I might not be like most people but I don't cling onto the first Zelda game I played. I'm always pleasantly surprised that I found other zelda games I liked more as the more zelda games I played. 
33184,When I play a new game I always go with an open mind. I never assume it will be bad or will be my favorite. I'm just saying it would be nice if Nintendo made my new favorite Zelda game and I truly believe they are capable of doing so.
