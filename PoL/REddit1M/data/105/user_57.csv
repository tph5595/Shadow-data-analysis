32883,"Dragon's Dogma has that, to an extent. Lots of different big monsters in that game, including Beholders and Hydras."
32961,"Phantom Hourglass kind of had that problem too, but it was easily forgivable because of how fantastic the actual content was."
33394,"Skyrim on Ultra looks like crap, don't even give me that. Skyrim with lots and lots of mods, however, is fantastic. And if you go with the ""Alright, Skyrim is a beautiful game for being on console"" argument, I'll present you with:

Dragon's Dogma

Banjo Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts

Far Cry 3, BD, and 4

Halo franchise

Dark Souls (you can't quite tell, but the textures are actually ridiculously high resolution, could have easily been a first-person game)

Sonic Unleashed and Generations

Fable 3

Uncharted 3

Gears of War 3

LittleBigPlanet 2

Battlefield 3

Portal 2

Dead Space 2

The list goes on, and on, and on."
