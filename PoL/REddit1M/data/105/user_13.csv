13782,"It's probably overly hopeful to want way more than the rest of zeldas, but if it is just a bit more than MM or WW I'll be very happy and I think that's a very reasonable hopr"
13839,"Hopefully it means stuffed with side quests in the way MM was. I mean that game only had four temples, but tons of content!"
29286,"Rupees as rewards are the worst. *At least* I like upgrades for carrying more stuff as rewards. Like the seeds/deku sticks/deku nut upgrades in Ocarina. Those are essentially useless upgrades, but they *feel* much better to earn than rupees. You're making it toward 100%.

But I'll pretty much always stick by masks in MM  as the best side quest rewards. Every single mask was useful, if even just to earn you a single heart piece. Many of them had more interesting uses that weren't necessary to beat the game though, like the stone mask, giant's mask, bunny hood, blast mask.."
29970,"That's a very simplified way of looking at it. When it comes to Zelda they aren't making the same game over and over but iteratively better (like say a CoD, or a racing game). They take a gameplay and setting foundation and build a new game every time basically. 

You can't just make ""improvements"" to say Majora's Mask and end up with Wind Waker. They have entirely different core mechanics, worlds, progression, mood. 

And if you somehow expect every Zelda installment to be ""better"" then I suppose you've been extremely disappointed in the series as a whole since generally people think of OoT or LttP as the ""best"" in the series (and those were a long time ago)"
32137,"Oh good. Yeah, I don't cling to the first ones I played either, and I've been playing them for over 15 years. But I always expect the next game to be fun, new, and different. If it happens to the best Zelda game ever made, that's awesome. But since I come to each Zelda for a different experience (not a ""better"" experience than the last) I'm always happy."
52973,"That was always so frustrating. Honestly most of the time I wish I would take it anyway despite it not fitting. It's not like I was ever going to go back there to pick up the money, but then the treasure chest icon would never leave the minimap."
53155,"Nice. I never noticed the similarities between the giant's knife and razor sword. However, at least Biggoron's Sword was just as cool-looking as the giant's knife. I'm sure I'm not the only one that thought the razor sword looked badass and wished you could just use it for the rest of the game."
