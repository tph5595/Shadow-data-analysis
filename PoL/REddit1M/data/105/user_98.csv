I might try the put some money a side each day, but when you can literally run down to Â£2 in your bank, its a tough one! 

We'll get there some day man! :)  
We have probably over a year to save before ZeldaU."

I once tried to save for a Wii U when I saw Windwaker HD, but damn energy companies decided to screw me over with a price rise and that fund went in a day lol

Weeks of saving, one day of destruction! 

For me its being unable to work due to illness, so funds are tight, I have been tempted to get one on finance and bite the bullet for some entertainment.. But considering the debt, It does scare me so I will probably try save myself haha.

I hope your move goes well and you will be basking in Hyrule glory in no time! :D"
