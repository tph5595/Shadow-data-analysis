44820,"Gold Skulltulas (as well as Maiamais) were a very different thing. They always made a sound and were in places you had to reach anyway or that were explorable, so it was possible to get them all without the need for a guide. Bugs, Poes, Gratitude Crystals and others like those are not fun because they're in random places and finding them is a tedious chore that takes too long without a guide. "
