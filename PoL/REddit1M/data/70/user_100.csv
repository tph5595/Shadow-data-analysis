&gt;Hyrulean Adventure is the main campaign of *Four Swords Adventures*, and can be played by one to four players. It consists of eight worlds, each with three stages and a [boss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boss_(video_games\)) battle. The graphics are similar to that of the Game Boy Advance version, but the maps are static rather than randomly generated, the top-down view is taken from *[The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past)*, and gameplay includes effects from *[The Wind Waker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_The_Wind_Waker)*. The graphics also include enhanced atmospheric effects such as cloud shadows that slowly move across the ground, heat shimmer, dust storms, and fog. Music is based on that of *[A Link to the Past](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_A_Link_to_the_Past)*, but is rearranged in places.
