1714,"I don't understand why everyone forgets that Ocarina and MM had cartoon graphics!  Why does everyone think that they were serious in the graphic department, because they weren't.... at all.  The only one with semi-serious graphics was twilight princess and even that didn't have completely realistic character models.  Just because it's cell-shaded, doesn't mean it won't be taken seriously.  It's people who can't look past the graphics that are the problem, not the people who care about the content and not the suprficial details.  I, for one, think this is an awesome art style that adds a depth to the scenery and turns the world into a work of art!  There will be so many interesting things to see in this world and this art style will make them 10x cooler! It'll add style to the game, that I think TP lacked, honestly.  Personality is part of the game.  I won't downvote you because that's not what downvoting is for.  But I do strongly disagree with you"
