2058,"Let's compare: [SS](http://www.blog.jaychan.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Link-Skyward-Sword-610-igx-584x303.png) vs [WiiU](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BpyJ5zqIIAEgNYg.png)


Also, look at his [bracers](http://img4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20110722140937/zelda/es/images/1/13/Ganondorf_Artwork_3d.png), aren't they familiar?
"
2520,"I vote more for magic but honestly, I hope he's a boy... The plot would derrail into how Link is a girl really quick and I'd hate that... We've seen what happened in recent metroid. I'd love Nintendo to pull a caracther like this off but I'm sorry, I don't trust them with my most loved franchise"
3467,Metroid other M
3834,"Well you've got a point there... But as I said earlier.... I love link too much, sorry"
5416,"What is more relevant though? Other M is the most recent game and I feel that nintendo hasn't done a femenine character since because they didn't pull it off then, and I don't want them to try it again on my favourite franchise, thank you very much"
6160,But not always has her character been developed well. [Here's a video that explains it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LVOd3NuKfkY) the core gameplay was great... But sadly the story didn't give nothing new and revolved too much around Samus
6625,"But that didn't happen in Other M! They focused on her emotions and tried to give her a more ""humane"" feel... And kinda failed *horribly* I **hope** that if they decide to make link a girl **they'll** have the sense to do it right. Then I won't have a problem"
7022,...That's kinda what I've been saying all along
7929,"Well yes, but it was the last game done by Nintendo where the protagonist was a girl, and failed at that. I don't have anything against femenine protagonists at all but I don't want Nintendo experimenting again on that, *especially* on Zelda which explicitly states that Link is a boy various times if you read the story literally (hero&gt;male)"
8126,It isn't *that* different from SS though...
8863,"Well..... Link is that, just a link between you and the game, that's why he's called that, so *I guess it could work*
It wouldn't be the legend of Zelda for me, though"
9443,"About to start that... but yeah, I get where you're coming from"
11725,"I'd be okay with that... But I guess it would be hard to implement: think of the narrative, it would be weak, since they wouldn't be able to establish the same relationship between all characters versus if they only had to do one genere. Zelda has almost always been guided by Link wanting to rescue Zelda at it's core. This wouldn't work. Also, the archstory wouldn't make sense"
13785,"...No one would buy that, it would be even more forced than the three story split in OoT... It's obvious that Zelda has always been the tipical knight saves princess, more obvious or less, but it would be weird to see a female link do all the knighting, and not from a role standpoint! But due to the fact that the franchise has been established as Link male Zelda female and that's the core. Changing that would break what makes a Zelda game for me: the motivations would be different, the interactions between characters, etc. I'm okay with them starting a new Ip or a new take on the series (imagine a steampunk Zelda game!) but not a game with the tipical hyrule like what we saw on the trailer, it wouldn't be the same."
16728,"But, as cool as that sounds, the ""curse"" of the godess wouldn't exist, so there would be no link or zelda (maybe?)! I think that first it starts after SS but they go back to the old times, get all this ""magi-tech"" and use it to defeat the first ganon."
68803,May be...
68867,Where did he say that? Whaaat? He could mean by that that the person on the trailer was Zelda all along...
69623,"thanks! edit: actually, what if the game goes on about how a random boy/girl *becomes* the hero of time? *that* would be amazing. He/she isn't the hero by some reincarnation, but by right!"
71690,"&gt;Perhaps. But wouldn't that be the Link in SS?

Well, not necessarily: as a hero of time, he/she could come from the future and live in the past, but in /u/TedJustice theory there would be no Link, Zelda *or* Ganondorf, which could make things complicated in the overall-arch and in-game aswell. I'd like to see the ""before"" times, but as I said, traveling from the future (maybe grabbing weapons and getting help from the ancestors against an upcoming fight with Ganon?)"
73389,"Well yeah, but Link has had power over time in many games (Phantom Hourglass for example, or SS itself) and this wouldn't be new. 

&gt;they could use the game to show us more of the Zelda lore.

But the problem here is that you know how it's all going to end: the war is won by the *godess* not a hero, and it results in a phyrric victory that scaterrs and collapses civilizations. That's why I don't want the game entirely focused on that era, even if you can travel back to that, like (minimally) the time chronolites on SS or a more developed version of the Hyrule castle in WW"
73883,"Indeed :D!, But then again, every single Zelda game is just that, a legend"
