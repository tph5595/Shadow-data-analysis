Yeah, it's bright and colourful. If you can't take it seriously than that's not a failure on the games part, that's your inability to get appreciate it for what it is. Think you can't create feeling with cel shading? Remember the first time you get to Hyrule in Wind Waker? Or the final battle? Or the look on Link's grandmother's face when he leaves? Emotion and feeling for days. Skyward Sword had lighthearted moments, sure, but the backstory alone was incredibly dark and sombre. Hell, A Link to the Past had it's moments and you can't call it anything graphically brilliant. 

This subreddit is really getting to be an MM circle jerk. Has been for a long time. Don't get me wrong, MM is fine, but it's nowhere near my favourite in the series. It just seems that the ""dark"" and angsty Zelda titles seem to hit a chord with a particular audience here. Maybe it's an age gap thing. "
