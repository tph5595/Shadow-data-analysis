3354,"I doubt it.  It seemed like the whole point of the hood was to reveal Link as female when it was removed.  

That and Link's face looks more feminine that usual.  Just ignore the fact that Link has always been male in the past and look at Link's appearance in this one; it definitely looks female to me."
9626,"The fact that Link was revealed with a hood makes me think that the idea was to hide a surprise (the gender). 

It also looks like Link may have breasts but it's difficult to tell.  This is based mostly on the front of Link's chest tapering down to the waist where in Skyward sword it was the opposite (it tapered out as it got closer to his waist).  

The ponytail is something new that suggest it could be a female Link (obviously not conclusive though).

Link's face looks more feminine that ever before (which is saying a lot considering Skyward Sword Link had a pretty feminine face).  Link also looks thinner than in past games.

And last of all, if it were not for any previous preconceptions on the character, I would most certainly think the character is female on appearance alone.  The only thing that makes me even consider it being a male is that it is Link who has been male in all the past games.

Granted all of this is just speculation and it's impossible to tell either way."
10495,"It's Nintendo, they aren't going to give Link huge breasts if they make him a girl in this game.  Plus there are far too many things point towards female to make me ignore it.  Ponytail is new, a more feminine looking face and build (whether or not that is just Link being younger), and the hood for a unveiling.  Not to mention they talked about breaking previous Zelda conventions.

Regardless, there is no way you can say that it doesn't look like a female Link at all.  It's literally pointless to argue that it is definitely argue that Link is definitely male or definitely female because it's so ambiguous at this point."
12872,There is literally 0 way to tell.  So what is the point.  All I'm saying is there are definitely feminine features and that COULD mean a female link.
13203,Ok kid. 
14138,"What are you even going on about.  You say Link looks effeminate and androgynous....that means it's a possibility based on looks alone that link could be female. 

"" It should be obvious to everyone that Link will never be a women. "" 

I don't know where you get that from because Link is a different person in most of the games.  A reincarnation of Link could certainly be female.  The key is that it is impossible to know what the gender will be and so there is no point in arguing your point any further unless you can dig up a quote from Miyamoto stating ""Link will never be female""."
14532,Samus doesn't get reincarnated.
15054,"Yet there is baby Mario, a Zelda that isn't a princess, several Zelda games that don't take place in Hyrule,  several versions of Link all coexisting (The Four Swords), games that don't have Ganon as the villain.  Nothing is really set in stone."

Can clearly see a bust and the face does not look male at all imo."
21612,"You can't say just face it until it is official. I'm far from the only person who thinks Link looks like a girl.

22066,"I never said he was a girl.  I said it COULD be a girl because it looks like a girl.  

I still don't understand why you are so bent up on that.  Would it really piss you off that much if they did switch his gender up?"
22949,It's not important for Link to be female...
23105,It's also not important for Link to be male either.
23277,lol
39104,"Link was made cartoon-like in Wind Waker.  Wouldn't that classify as a similar situation? Link's gender likely has no significant impact other than appearance and voice. Similarly, Link from Wind Waker was just a cosmetic change.

It turns out it may be Link anyways.  I'm curious, how would you feel if that character is actually Zelda or a child of Link?"
40758,"Yeah, I wonder.  I kind of agree.  I think if it's not Link it would be pretty cool to get away from the typical story line. 

If Link were to change gender, it wouldn't really bother me.  It would be like the Wind Waker art style imo because it would still fit into the lore of the game.  If it were a character like Samus or Mario, I agree it would make no sense and there would  be no reason to change gender as it doesn't make sense with the story.  So I can kind of see where you are coming from. 

Personally I would be excited about a gender swap as it would essentially be a new story element (further explaining the specifics of how the reincarnation works in the Zelda universe).  I also think it is because Link is so androgynous anyways that it would barely affect the appearance and thus wouldn't harm the feel of the character.  It would be a bit different if they overly feminized a female link (hair farther below the shoulders,  heavy makeup, etc...).  That would just feel cheesy. "
