8595,The gender thing is not a rule and has never been stated by Nintendo as canon.  Reincarnation as a general concept also lacks such a rule.
8944,"It's been discussed over the past year on reddit fairly frequently--the ""what if there was a game with Link as a girl?"" idea.  It's interesting and I'd love to see how they do it, but I don't think this teaser necessarily implied Link's gender either way.

People are pointing to the restyled hair (pony tail, gasp! Men can't possibly have pony tails), ""feminine"" features (not a far cry from the SS look), and the right-handed bow shooting.  The most compelling to me is the right-handedness, though that could be for a number of reasons (motion controls, Link learning to steady the bow's aim with his dominant hand rather than pull the arrow with it, etc.)  We also assume that character is Link, but it could easily be someone else.  The fact that s/he was in disguise is interesting, though it could simply be a mechanism for dramatically revealing the new look.  However, maybe Link needs to take on disguises in this game.  The horse also lacks Epona's typically blond mane--maybe they are both in disguise."
8989,Nor A Link Between Worlds.
9071,That's not what reincarnation is.
9789,"Right, I was just saying that it's been an idea floating around so I thought maybe people are clinging to it. "
