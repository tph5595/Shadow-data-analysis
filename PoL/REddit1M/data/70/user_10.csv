1516,This is either a very young Link or it's a girl. Either one is fine by me! I've been thinking about it recently and there's no reason at all that the spirit of the hero should HAVE to be reincarnated into a boy each time. 
1610,They wouldn't dare make a Link without green tunic as at least an option!  I'm super glad they're taking more liberties with it these days though.
27036,Why definitely? There's nothing definite about it. 
28067,Shiek and Metroid would like a word with you.
29137,"Yes I do. You're right. I've never actually PLAYED Metroid, I just knew the main character was a girl. "
