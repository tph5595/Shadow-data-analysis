53296,"Let's review some things; Zelda's hair is always a bright yellow goldish color.  The hair color for this character is definitely the hair color most attributed to Link in practically all previous games.

However; all of the proportions for this character are not male in the least. Look at the shoulders, the neck, the angle of the facial structures, the eyebrows, the shape of the eyes, the hips, the shape of the legs.

frame by frame look at how the hero jumps off of the horse.  You will see side-boob underneath their right arm.  Look at how the light and shadow plays off of the chest during the arrow shooting portion; this is a girl.

It also isn't Zelda."
53385,"They said in the interview that it is not necessarily link.

That does not mean the same thing as what you said."
53417,Except Zelda has golden hair.
53463,"Watch the hero jumping off the horse frame by frame.  There is definitely side-boob.

Also, look at the hips."

No offense meant."
60158,"I don't disagree that it's Link.

However, this is a girl."
62652,"That's fair.  For my part, I have trouble seeing a boy.  I will agree that at certain angles, the character seems androgynous, but there are certain angles in the video where I can see nothing but girl.

I guess we'll all just wait and see.

EDIT: Although there is all this...

Note at Time index 3:26 the curvature of her chest as well as the curvature of the back and shoulders, and again at time index 3:27. Look at 3:27 and how the arm contacts the shoulder, the shape of said shoulders in relation to the neck and head. Look at the thighs.
Watch at Time Index 3:32 as she jumps from the horse. At 3:34 there is again more indication of curvature of breasts. At time index 3:39, note how the chest folders OVER the leather strap."
206393,"And as I've stated elsewhere; nowhere in what you just pasted does he actually state the gender of the character in the reveal is male.

You are assuming.  Just like the reporters were assuming when he inferred ""Nobody explicitly said this was Link"" as meaning the character was not Link.

Eiji Aonuma is being cagey and dodgey about the gender issue, and what you've quoted doesn't (In fact) clear that up at all.

What is clear, however, is that the character shown was Link, he has clarified that it is Link.

He has not clarified the gender."
