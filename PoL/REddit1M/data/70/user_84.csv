37439,But this doesn't rule out the possibility of having Link's soul/essence/wathever in a female body.
38301,Your openess to possibilities is ridiculously low.
38350,"I'll high five you for being cool. I agree with you. This ""Link"" even has intense eyelashes..."
38714,"&gt; It's just not going to happen, they're Iconic characters from the 80's which aren't going to change.

Unless you're Moyamoto himself, you're in no position to state such facts. Everything you've been writing so far in the gender debate are **your beliefs** and they're **as valid as anybody else disagreeing with you**. So quit screaming like a stubborn goat it'll never happen nor Link in Wii U is a boy because the truth is: **you. Don't. Know.**

Review your discussion skills when it comes to speculation, you've been forcing your view on everybody so far. "
39208,"&gt; I was pissed off in what they did with Dante in DmC, don't fuck around with Iconic characters,

... Link has been redesigned countless of times, the same goes for the personality, and you were able to deal with it. Your comparison with Dante is clunky.

We had the mature ""TP"" Link, the ""toon childish clumsy Link"", the train engineer, the lover (Skyward Sword). Link had many reboots. You couldn't deal with Dante's change for certain reasons, but you didn't mind Link being reinvented with each game... Yet going for a gender change would be a nightmare to you. You seem to be selective in what is acceptable and not when it comes to an iconic character.

It's alright to not want it, but your desire got in the way of a debate about speculations and possibilities, which is unhealthy for a discussion."
40121,"Don't take it the bad way (though you're perfectly allowed to), but you're the kind of fan who is unhealthy in the long run for a franchise. I mean, just look around you. The majority (if not everybody) is thrilled/hyped/speculating on Link's gender without issue. They're open to the idea and excited for this possibility. You're not. You want something to be set in stone because ""you like it that way"". You're even inventing reasons (""the lore""?) to add weight to your arguments. Your perspective prevent evolution and change.

Any fans of any franchise in the world scream and walk with torches and pitchforks the minute any kind of important change happens. Resident Evil's fan base has been in debate/fight for years ever since Capcom stopped using the fixed camera angle and slow paced gameplay for something more action oriented. The famous classic vs. modern entries. The same happened with Tomb Raider when Crystal Dynamics took over, bringing in their own vision.

I'm not saying all changes are good, but sometime they can be. Unfortunately, fans in general have this mentality that for a franchise they like to be good, it needs to remain the **same** until the end of time and if the game studio dare to touch something, it's the end of the world. This lack of open mind toward any major change is harmful and bring divisions among the fans... Since most of them become **possessive/entitled/over-protective** toward what they love.

""I like this game THAT WAY, I **don't** want it to change"". So long for any kind of evolution huh? Fans seem to forget they've been given what they want since the beginning. It might be far fetched, but the fear of change is also very common within the society and a major obstacle for progression.

Just a piece of mind I thought I should share. That said, I have nothing else to add. Time will tell.

40871,"&gt; Resident Evil characters were always the same characters,

Well... Biologically yes, but personality-wise, Leon was changed completely (if you're familiar with the franchise, you'll know what I'm talking about). Most characters got super-ninja-esque ability, bullet-time speed and all. I don't think we can really speak about them being ""the same"" anymore. Tomb Raider got rebooted twice. I ended loving the newest games as much as I loved the classics. But some are unable and prefer to hate Crystal Dynamic's game. It's their choice but I just don't see the point.

&gt; I want change in Zelda it was getting stale but changing the characters for the sake of changing them isn't where you begin.

Well that's assuming they changed for the sake of it, which I doubt is the case, especially considering Nintendo's background. They've been making polished games for *decades*.

&gt; You begin with gameplay, environment, items, combat, how big you want the world and an interesting story

When a game development begins, there's a brainstorming, then the first initial concept arts... And along the first concepts, there are the first lines of the story, to guide the game in a certain direction. If Link was set to be female, I don't think it was a last minute decision because ""convention lulz"", it might have been initially decided with the very very first concepts of the story and the visuals. All I'm trying to say is:

=&gt; Instead of panicking and searching reasons for something nobody is sure of, just take a deep breath and take things as they come. If anything the Link we saw wasn't Link but a tease to the storyline, or perhaps it was him (or her?) I don't know. But it's pointless for now to fear anything and jump to conclusions. If in the end Link is a girl, I'm sure Nintendo will have one big good reason for it. I've never been disappointed/disgusted with any Zelda entry and it's not tomorrow it'll begin. Have faith, *they're good in what they're doing*."
