If you have to analyze something frame by frame to try and see something that isn't even visible, especially when it's clearly not there from the hundreds of other frames where you have a much better view of him, then I think your over analyzing it. 

That's not even the part that gives it away though. Look at these,  [New Link](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BpyJ5zqIIAEgNYg.png) , [Skyward Sword Link](http://www.blog.jaychan.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/Link-Skyward-Sword-610-igx-584x303.png)

The hair pattern is the same... Down to the spots where the hair breaks off it is exactly the same. The only difference is that the new one pays better attention to detail. It's a 14-15 year old looking link."
59167,Maybe someone found him young and raised him with or among the gerudos in this one?.. Would explain the bracers and perhaps he wore that cloak to hide all the features that would obviously give away a hylian?

205979,"Zelda series producer Eiji Aonuma has now cleared up any doubt about the identity of the protagonist, insisting the trailer does show Link.

""It's a rumour,"" he told MMGN. ""Actually that comment I made jokingly. It's not that I said that it wasn't Link. It's that I never said that it was Link. It's not really the same thing, but I can understand how it could be taken that way.

""It seems like it has kind of taken off where people are saying 'oh it's a female character' and it just kind of grew. But my intent in saying that was humour. You know, you have to show Link when you create a trailer for a Zelda announcement.""

TL;DR: It's a male Link"
207052,"As someone stated elsewhere nintendo isn't the kind of company to genderbend their protagonist to gain sales.

""It seems like it has kind of taken off where people are saying '**oh it's a female character**' and it just kind of grew. But my intent in saying that was humour"", Aonuma is a troll and he got people to talk about the game which is his job.

He could have said ""It seems like it has kind of taken off where people are saying '**oh it's not link**' "", But instead he chose to directly address the gender issue and then call it a joke. That's enough to solidify it. You just don't like to be wrong."
