39775,"I don't think Hyrulean ever appears as a word in any Zelda game. Hylians are the dominant human species native to Hyrule. I can see where you can get into the semantics that ""Hylian"" is only ever mentioned in context of things belonging to the Hylians, but at the same time, when referencing other things, the situation is avoided by using things like ""X to Hryule, y from Hyrule"" and so on.

If Hyrulean appears as an adjective and I just don't remember it (likely, as there's a shit ton of zelda-verse to remember) I'd gladly concede the point, but most references to things belonging to Hyrule (the kingdom of Hylians) is referred to as Hylian."
