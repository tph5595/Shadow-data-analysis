42972,"I'd like to start by saying that I'm incredibly upset that you've been downvoted so much for the sole reason of sharing your opinion that so many others disagree with. Personally my favorite Zelda game is (and will be for a very long time) Twilight Princess. I absolutely love the atmosphere and air that the beginning of the game has. It starts off simple and bright, but as soon as your adventure truly begins it slowly becomes darker as you enter the Twilight and discover the adverse affects it's had on the denizens of Hyrule. The art style and direction also emphasized the melancholic tone and, for me, created in incredibly immersing experience. In the end, the art style chosen to be used deeply affects the mood of the game. While story is great when used to display feeling and emotion, when the art complements it as well this results in an even more engrossing experience.

That said I truly believe what is most important to the art style is that they accurately portray the mood that the company hopes to convey to the player as they play through the story. While a part of me craves the despair seen throughout Hyrule that will always intrigue and excite me, I understand that the same art style wouldn't be nearly as effective if used for an entry such as Skyward Sword in which you have very colorful personalities such as Zelda, Groose and the rest of the cast. An important thing to remember is that Zelda games are always making a unique experience for every title. Eventually another game in the franchise will come along and house a more serious tone with more realistic graphics to showcase it's atmosphere. Don't lose hope, I'm sure that Nintendo will eventually release another installment in the series more catered to our liking. Unfortunate, this year isn't the one for you to be ecstatic about, but it's only a matter of time before more fans like you or me become more vocal about wanting another realistic and slightly more dreary title towards the Zelda development team. Nonetheless, just like you I'm thrilled for the new title announced today and can't wait to see what Nintendo has been cooking up over the last few years next holiday."
