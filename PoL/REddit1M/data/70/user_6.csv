1198,"I'll be downvoted for this, but I think that the cel-shaded look takes a lot away from the impact the Zelda story can make. Skyward Sword is beautiful (when emulated), but I can't ever seem to take it seriously when it needs to be taken seriously. It's too cartoony.

Majora's Mask was dark, mysterious, and made you become invested in characters. Ocarina of Time may have had it's goofy moments (Which, don't get me wrong, is and should always be a part of Zelda), but when it was supposed to be taken seriously, you could feel the tension. Think of Link watching Ganondorf chasing Zelda outside Hyrule Town.

Then there's the penultimate battle with Ganondorf in Twilight Princess. Sword to sword, face to face; it was amazing, and the graphics added a sense of reality to it that the cel-shading just doesn't.

Overall, I'm excited about this Zelda and of course I'll be buying it, but I am extremely disappointed that Nintendo refuses to fully utilize the Wii U, especially after teasing us with their tech demo."
18303,"OoT and MM had ""cartoon"" graphics because they were made so long ago. If you look back on any game made during their time, they'll all look cartoony now.

I agree that there should always be a lightheartedness to the Zelda series, it's what makes it so nostalgic and not just another RPG. But it's 2014, they have a brand new console that they proved CAN make a very intense, realistic looking Zelda, yet they decided to use cel-shading regardless to give it the painterly beauty.

As for Wind Waker, I completely agree with you that the art style was spectacular and worked for the game. Link was a child, and it added a good bit of youth to the game for it to look like a cartoon. And I loved it.

This Link looks almost like a young teenager, not quite a child but not quite the ""Man"" Link from TP. The battle scene we were shown looked pretty badass, and if the game can turn from peaceful to dark that quickly, it'll make for a great game.

But honestly, this really needs to be the last time they use this tactic. Maybe they used Cel-Shading to save room for the vast world, maybe they used it for the painterly effect. But it definitely wasn't because the Wii U couldn't handle realistic graphics. 

The reason I'm disappointed is because they showed us a beautiful game world during the tech demo, then backed out of it. Honestly, those were the most beautiful graphics I've ever seen. While I'm not a graphics whore, I think that they should utilize the Wii U to it's fullest. The reason OoT made such an impact was because it was ahead of it's time. It needs to happen again, and I think that through all their ""innovation"", the graphics will be the ultimate icing on the cake that perfects the series."

My main point is not that I hate the game or how it looks, but that I'm ultimately disappointed that Nintendo would tease us with what they're capable of, then give us Skyward Sword HD."
