4445,"As a long haired guy with a fro, I approve of both of your long hairs and the idea of Link having long hair."
4974,What about all the other Metroid games where Samus being a girl doesn't matter?
5068,"Because Zelda fans are some of the most, stubborn, tradition-based fans around. "
7824,"... you realize Other M was done by Team Ninja, right?"
8804,"... so they aren't allowed to change it?

I'd fully embrace a female Link - or a gender option. Just write the story in the same way."
11490,I think the best would be an option. That way you can choose a Link you identify with more.
12633,"How wouldn't it work? Why can't a female Link or a male Link want to rescue Zelda and save Hyrule? What archstory wouldn't make sense that there's a Link who isn't a man? I mean, it never says that the Hero HAS to be male; hero is just the English masculine form, but maybe in Hylian there is no difference between Hero and Heroine? Bam, it's just a translation thing and it all makes sense again."
32251,There are multiple Links and only one Mario or Samus. It'd be like complaining about a blonde Bond or black Doctor. 
47264,"So a white character like the Doctor (from Doctor Who) becoming black is okay, because disliking that is racist, but disliking a character being female isn't sexist? Or am I misunderstanding?

My point with Bond was that those complaints were dumb. 

I can understand liking a male Link, but a female Link wouldn't ruin the character in my opinion."
50690,"I guess I don't see how a reincarnation of the sprit of the hero being female messes everything up.

For instance, I agree with the Doctor, mainly because he identifies as male. But it also would make for an interesting character development to have him be in a female body. Handled wrong it'd be terrible, handled right it could be good. Why can't this be the case?"
