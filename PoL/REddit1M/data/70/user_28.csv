3295,"I really, really hope so. I see a lot of people saying there seems to be a hint of a bust, and someone said the gasp at 3:08 sounds feminine. Though I can't hear anything on my shitty speakers.

That plus coupled with the lack of a face reveal until the last minutes... I dunno. I would lose my shit if we got a female Link finally though. Especially in a game that sounds this amazing."
3390,"&gt; The plot would derrail into how Link is a girl really quick

...What?"
3717,How is that relevant to Link being a girl or not? Other M had nothing to do with a similar issue. Not to mention Zelda is still being handled by the original team and not passed off.
7506,"? It doesn't screw that up at all. The concept of reincarnation doesn't have anything to do with the sex you're reincarnated as. Also a female Link doesn't have to mean a male Zelda. While *I* wouldn't mind them going that route without removing the typical romance angle, there are still several titles with no romance between the pair at all to save the poor pearl-clutching bigots from ""the gays."""
8558,"I'm certainly no lore expert, so if that's the case, well. Eh. I'll have to poke around to find some sources on that then. Little disappointing if that's how it goes though."
9050,"I don't think it'd be like making Samus a man, since again, Link isn't established in-world as the *same* character in every game, sequels aside. If the curse weren't there it'd be fine to make him a female for one incarnation.

Same as how a lot of Doctor Who fans want a female Doctor. Sure, it'd be weird after 50 years of 13 men, but there's nothing *strictly* saying he can't regenerate into a woman. "
9894,"Well, yes, I know, but I mean logistically, lore-wise, there's nothing mechanically/physically preventing it, were it to be an option. "
