121938,"Actually, ""Hyrulean"" is used as [the main campaign name in Four Swords Adventures](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Four_Swords_Adventures#Hyrulean_Adventure). 

I don't think ""Hylian"" has ever been used to refer to anyone aside from long-eared humans. Also, thanks to Skyward Sword's introduction of the goddess Hylia, it can be safely assumed that the long-eared humans, who share her image, are named after her."
