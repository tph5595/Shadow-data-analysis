18692,"Link being reborn female isn't lore breaking, it's entirely possible and doesn't change or mess up anything. Link almost never has a romance with Zelda in the games, only hints like winks and staring into each other's eyes. Usually Link ends up liking a female other than Zelda anyway, such as Malon/Midna/Marin.

People also originally speculated Yuga was a female reincarnation of Ganon(Demise) but it just ended up being an effeminate right hand man who worked for Ganon."
