5171,"Nope, just a regular looking Japanese teenage male. "
5233,"Still looks male to me, guess you don't play enough Japanese games to realize that sometimes the teenage males are very feminine "
5415,"That's just how the japanese like to show their young teenage boys. Link always looked like a women, guess they're going to the young teenage look with this one. Probably around the age of 14-15. "
5783,"Everyone is calling Link female, I'm just surprised that people still haven't realized that the japanese like to make their young teenage looking boys effeminate.  "
5826,Probably at 13-15 young male Link. He has some Native look towards him atm with his long hair. Definitely a male though. 
5841,JUst you
5949,"Well he's kinda right. The curse place on Hylian and the First Link stated that they would be reincarnated for all times. 

Kinda screws up the reincarnation of Link if he pops out as a girl and Zelda as a boy. "
5985,Samus was always a women. 
6042,"Most definitely a he, Link always looked feminine but I guess he's younger in this game so he looks even more so. I'm guessing around 13-15ish.  "
6460,Well seeing how young he looks and that he's flat chested I can safely awesome young boy instead of girl. That and the lore kinda makes it so Zelda and Link always come back as themselves with just a different life. 
6525,Because her story isn't important at all. Metroid was all about being a badass space bounty hunter and killing shit. 
6921,"Yeah that's why Other M sucked. Samus is a badass, she isn't supposed to be all human and what not, she's the Boba Fett of Metroid.

Sorry to say but Link will never be a girl/women, the lore already stated that Hylian and Link will always come back. Hylian and Zelda so she can be reborn and Link as the protector or what not for all eternity. They kinda wrote themselves to the wall on the fact that Zelda will always be female and Link male.  "
7767,"You don't understand, the reincarnation isn't like our world reincarnation. It's only applies to 3 things in the Hyrule history and that is Hylian, Demises Spirit and Link. They will always come back as themselves gender and all, expectation of Hylian loosing god hood and becoming mortal as Zelda. 

It's a curse placed upon them to keep coming back over and over again . Their spirits will never be at rest. Link will always be male, Zelda female and demise coming back in whatever villain decides to show up. "
8330,"Most be the shadows you saw because he's most def is flat chested in that clip. Even more so when you see him draw the bow back and his shirt clings to his chest, no breasts there. "
8812,"Meh, they would never change the genders of established characters anyway. It would be like making Samus a man, just doesn't sit right. "
8869,"Guess you're glossing over the whole, you will come back as yourself and forget everything to do battle for all eternity bit. "
8910,"You are correct, keep forgetting the people and kingdom are named after her. "
9219,That's not how our reincarnation is. We're talking about the Zelda universe reincarnation that is only on 3 people in the Zelda universe because it's a curse placed on them. Nothing out of religion so our world reincarnation doesn't work in the game. 
9292,"Actually in doctor who there is a reason why there won't be a female doctor, he never wants to be one. It's stated that other time lords have done so but that isn't for him. 

"
9940,"Really, in the teaser he definitely doesn't have breasts. See him draw his bow, no breast what so ever, also I'm guessing the cloak was just to unveil his new young look than anything. "
10809,"Ponytail =/= Female, also japanese love making young teenage boys look feminine, this isn't new. When they said they were breaking away from previous Zelda conventions I think they were mostly talking about the world and combat. We're seeing new technology that hasn't been seen before in a Zelda game and a huge world to explore in a 3D world. Also huge breasts =/= no breasts like you see in the teaser. He literally has nothing there, if they were going the tomboy route they could at least given a little bump on the chest. Even Sheik on the n64 had a little bump on the chest. 

I also heard rumors about they been looking about internet play. If anything it's more about the gameplay and the world than the characters.  "
13067,"I can tell, it's obviously just a effeminate young Link. Not the first time this has happened in a japanese game.  "
13328,"Seems you're aggravated, I'm not sure why. It should be obvious to everyone that Link will never be a women. Nothing in the trailer screamed women just effeminate. "
14405,"Same reason Samus will never be male, because that's not who the character is meant to be. You can keep going on and on about your maybes but it's not going to happen ever. "
14688,"Doesn't' matter, she just as Link are an established Icon. You don't just change an iconic character because you feel like it, look what to capcom with Dante in DmC: Devil May Cry. 

Iconic characters never change for a reason. Link just like Mario and Samus are the faces of Nintendo. 


Also the curse already said they will come back as themselves so that means gender and race. Can't change that really. "
15299,"And yet they still had Link, Mario and Zelda as themselves gender and race. They can take liberates with the story and plot but they can't vastly change the character. Baby Mario was a spinoff only in the yoshi island game which kinda gives a background story of Mario and lugi. Zelda games were always had different plots because of the curse and link and Zelda were always their respected genders. The 4 links was just because of the 4 sword and non princess Zelda was because of hyrule being flooded and her having no idea about her ancestors. 

 "
18624,I'm really hoping we can use it throughout the game. 
19053,That's more like Nintendo just recycling characters. They really don't have a place in the reincarnation plot. 
21375,"That's just the shadow of him being hunched like that and he does look male. Just very feminine looking, just face it. Link is still male. 

This [image](http://i.imgur.com/bAzwj6E.png) is a much clearer view without any shadows. No breasts what so ever."
21890,"Looks like a girl =/= is a girl. Of course he looks likes a girl, that's the whole effeminate thing comes from. Even in that thread you linked shows a lot of people always said that Link was also effeminate they just went into more so in this game with the style they're using. 

So yeah, face it, Link will always be male.  "
22008,What about marth?
22374,"It's most definitally not a girl though, the only feminnem features he has is on his face and his slender build. That's it. 

I don't understand why **YOU** are so bent up on this. Link was always a guy and now that he's looks more girl like you are so desperate for it to be true when the probability of that happening is near non existent.

Why is it soo important for you for Link to be female? The only reason why I don't like it is because I don't like it when they changed established characters just for the sake of change, if they wanted to do that create a new IP and character. I don't want to play tomb raider without lara croft of Metroid without samus. I don't want to play Devil May Cry without the Dante I come love and replaced with a rebooted version of him.

Link and Zelda are constant characters and changing their gender just for the sake of change is stupid.  "
22996,You're right it's not so there is no reason for them to change his gender. 
23186,"It actually is since that's the Iconic Look of him. Male guy with blond hair, blue eyes and a green tunic that wields his sword with his left hand. That's the iconic Link we all come to love, it's very important to keep the icon alive. "
27341,"Because the only thing that makes him look like a women is his facial feature and slender build. There's nothing else that indicates him in being a women and they're just not going gender bend an iconic character just to changed things around, that's not what Nintendo is all about. "
28337,"Samus was big surprise since they never stated if she was male of female until the en of the game, after that she was always female, it would be unthinkable for them to change her gender to just change things up. 

Shiek wasn't an established character and there was also no mention of her gender either and was a huge surprise when it turned out to be Zelda. We have never seen sheik again and probably never will, that was only for the plot of her hiding, same with pirate Zelda. 

Those two are very different then taking an iconic character and changing their gender for the hell of it. You wouldn't want Samus as a man would you? I sure as hell don't, we don't get enough badass women bounty hunters, shit now I want another metroid game. "
29823,"If anything it's because it's just a tease they put together. This looks like his village cloths you see in WW and TP. I could've sworn he also only swings his sword with his left hand, everything is mostly down with his right. "
30498,"No way in hell is link a gerudo, there is nothing that would indicate such. No brown skin, red hair, rounded ears. The Link in the teaser is while skin, pointy ears, blue eyes. He was always reincarnated as a hylian anyways just like the first link was. 

Also all female gerudos regardless of who the father are always born with the same traits, brown skin, red hair etc etc. "
31090,Oh I know but I'm saying other than his sword is there anything else he wields with his left hand. Pretty sure in TP the GameCube version he uses his right hand to throw the boomerang 
31531,Link existed back then but not Zelda. Before SS there was only Hylia so yeah it's most definitely not before SS. 
31868,Not if they want to destroy an iconic character just for change they won't. It's like turning Samus into a man or Mario it a women. It's just not down with an established character since the 80's. 
31997,"Looks about 13-15ish really, if he was a female he would have had breasts by now. Definitely not a girl in the pic. "
32182,"It would surprise me, they wouldn't change an established character from the 80's just for the sake of change. "
32494,"And each link is basically the same each time. Left handed white male hylian in a green tunic. Only thing that every changes is probably his hair color and that was because of tech issues back then, concept art was always a white male, pointy eared hylian boy. 

It's minor changes that isn't too big like turning Mario from carpenter to plumper. Not a big issue that piss off the fans. 

Changing him from male to female would be like the change Dante got from devil may cry and that iconic character was only been in the gaming industry for 13 years.   


Also people did complain about bond being blond, not sure about the whole black doctor thing, that's not even remotely the same, that's just being racist. "
37690,"That's also stating that Zelda will have her soul or whatever in a male body. It's just not going to happen, they're Iconic characters from the 80's which aren't going to change. 

The japanese love honor and respect and totally changing a gender from a character is total disrespect to the original creator without permission. They take that shit very seriously, look at what happned to megaman when his creator left capcom, we will probably never see him again because Capcom is pissed off at the original creator even though they hold the IP. Same with the creator of Dante from Devil may cry when he saw the new Dante, he really was pissed off in how they changed his character but DmC was created by a western team so they didn't give a fuck. 

It's too big of a change to ever actually happen.  "
38644,"Oh I'm open to change of the story and area, the character themselves no. It's like playing a male Samus or a female Solid Snake. 

I was pissed off in what they did with Dante in DmC, don't fuck around with Iconic characters, if you want to change things up make a new IP that changes the characters drastically then just make a new character and new IP. "
38935,"W/e man, we'll see. I'm sure 98% sure there not going to change the gender just for change. "
39343,"WW is just an art style, that isn't really a big change at all really. If the character is Zelda or a child of Link and not actually Link they they can kiss the SS reincarnation curse good bye and just not have either Zelda or Link in the games any more and just explore the world of hyrule with other characters. 

I rather they just made it a spin off game then Legend of Zelda, spin offs are good. Megaman and mario games had spin offs with different characters so why not Zelda? I would actually love to play a game as Impa and explore her story and peoples background. "
39596,"Just but all Links were the same, silent protagonist that are lazy in the beginning and begrudgedly or forced into heroics against their will. The only really difference between each Link is art style and hand placement of the sword and probably hair color. They're all white males that have pointy ears. 

Changing a gender is completely different from changing hair color or art style. Each reinvention of Link doesn't change his personality or major looks in any sort of way to think ""This isn't Link"". This is actually the first time anyone is **ACTUALLY** confused in who the hell that person was in the teaser because of his effeminate looks. 


If they want a female protagonist in a zelda game, fine, make a spin off. I would love to play as Impa and go more into her backstory and her people. "
40523,"I never said to not change the gameplay or environment. Hell even the characters backgrounds can change but Link has always been constant and changing it now is stupid just to change him. He's still going to be a silent, lazy person who becomes heroic after being forced to, that is his character. 

I'm happy with change, look at what they're doing with Zelda U, it's fucking fantastic and I can't wait to hear more of it.

 Resident Evil characters were always the same characters, people didn't hate the characters but the gameplay for good reason. The game turned it's genre into something very different which is the reason people play the game in the first place, it went from survival horror to Action adventure game with some horror, it lost what made the series so good.

It's like changing Dark Souls into Devil May Cry with a lot of combos and super sayian mode that powers you hope and heals you at the same time. 


I want change in Zelda it was getting stale but changing the characters for the sake of changing them isn't where you begin. You begin with gameplay, environment, items, combat, how big you want the world and an interesting story. Loving finally seeing some advancement in technology in Zelda, it has long been needed. "
40967,"I'm just seeing since Link is such an established character in the Nintendo lineup it will be very difficult for them to drastically change him and Zelda. It doesn't stop them from making spin off series which probably this franchise needs, now that I said it I really want to play as Impa. Seeing her in SS and now Hyrule Warriors really makes me want to play her her for a whole action adventure game.  "
41138,"Hell I can understand Rookie Leon turning into secret agent Leon. He survived Racoon City and basically being force into the agency to protect shelly. Wesker went full Neo on us with the T-Virus he injects into himself (which was awesome, don't front). Christ Redfield went full steroids on us but him being all military dude bro is kinda expected, S.T.A.R.S was a very special unit.

"
47657,"I thought you meant an actual Doctor and not The Doctor from doctor who.....if he turned black I wouldn't give a flying fuck. 

I'm not disliking female Link because I'm sexist but because that's not who Link is, it's the same as making Link a gerudo or a zoran/goron. It wouldn't make fucking sense at all and according to you he can be anything because of reincarnation. 

I wouldn't want a blond Bond either but they made it and I lived with it, still wish they hadn't and I also don't want a Male Samus or a Tomb Raider without Lara Croft. It won't be the same, some of that feeling that made the game Iconic would be gone. 

In my opinion gender bending any established Iconic character is a big nope for me, doesn't matter who the fuck it is. It's one thing of changing Bonds hair color but if they gender bended him you can sure as hell be sure people would be piss. Same with the Doctor, he clearly stated he doesn't want to regenerate as a women even though the Time Lords can. "
80259,Thing is gerudos don't raise males at all. The only time they actually care for a male is with their century child 
180184,"No way in hell is correct because Gerudos will never raise a male child that isn't their own or any child really that isn't Gerudos. That's how their tribe is like which is heavily implied in MM and OoT. 

Gerudo braces just mean that he got them in a trade from them. Same reason why young link has Goron braces in OoT. Also Link was always good in horseback riding and marksmanship, that is one of the reasons why they let him wander around their fortress in OOT. "
182262,"&gt;Where is this rule written?

The Gerudo[1] are a recurring race in the The Legend of Zelda series. They are a reclusive tribe of thieves that consists entirely of women; however, every hundred years, a man who is destined to be their king is born. They have dark tanned skin, golden eyes and red hair. Gerudo warriors frequently wield glaive-like weapons and scimitars. They are known to have relations with Hylian men.

Meaning that they're consisted of women until the century child. They don't take in men in, only to mate with them. 

&gt;But his primary combat skill was always sword and shield. Where are his sword and shield in this clip?

If you look closely at the horses backback you will see the sword. This is just a teaser so of course they're not going to show everything. 

&gt;Exactly; if he earned their respect in previous games, why is it so farfetched that he would have some sort of connection to them in this game?



Because he hasn't earned their respect that we know of in this game. If he did then the only thing that is certain is that he's able to trade with them which would make the clothing thing there. 


Gerudo connection isn't silly, him being raised by one or being one is the silly part. He can trade with them, it's been shown in the past they trade with outsiders all the time except in Termina, they're just pirates that fuck 
shit up. 



Also a big hint why they never will take Link in is because of this little known fact of them
&gt;Those born into Gerudo society typically have little respect for the Hylian people, and the only men they ever truly revere are the males born into their tribe every hundred years. They usually seem to show distaste for Hyrulean culture, as in their eyes living in separate, wooden houses, worshipping Din, Nayru, and Farore, and having differing gender roles between men and women are all blasphemous.In Gerudo culture, the tribe is usually seen all living together."
182715,"So what you're saying is that Geruods aren't Gerudos anymore because time is different so their traditions doesn't matter anymore? 

You're trying to fit Link in with the Gerudos by forcing it and by not going what's already established with their culture.  If anything he bought the cloths in a shop that deal with Gerudo traders. It's probably going to be exactly like when you buy a Zora tunic or a Goron Tunic. 

&gt;where does it say that they absolutely would never raise an outsider as one of their own?  

Also I already posted why they won't in my last comment. The reason Link was taken care of by the Kokiri is because they had no idea he was Hylian, only the Deku tree did and he kept him hidden cause he felt great destiny from him. Gerudos won't give a fuck because they really don't like Hylians. "
183219,"Again you're not reading my whole comment. 

&gt;Those born into Gerudo society typically have little respect for the Hylian people, and the only men they ever truly revere are the males born into their tribe every hundred years. They usually seem to show distaste for Hyrulean culture, as in their eyes living in separate, wooden houses, worshipping Din, Nayru, and Farore, and having differing gender roles between men and women are all blasphemous.In Gerudo culture, the tribe is usually seen all living together.

They don't like Hylians, they wouldn't care for a boy child from Hylians. It's in their tradition, hell the first time Link sees them in Oot he's thrown in prison. 

Also like I said before the Kokiri had no idea he wasn't a Kokiri, they all thought he was one of them. The only person who knew he was Hylian was the Deku Tree, they don't even know who he is when he's an adult, they all thought he died when he left the forest because they thought he was like them. "
183376,"The Deku Tree broke the rules because he knew of his destiny. Also the Deku Tree doesn't have the same disrespect against the Hylians like the Gerudos do. 

&gt;You JUST link an excerpt saying that they are known to have relations with Hylian men... you're winning this argument for me against yourself

When did having sex =/= liking and love? They only go to Hylian men and other people because there's only women in the tribe. They need to repopulate somehow. Those men are dropped in a second when they're no longer needed. "
183499,"The Deku Tree didn't hate the Hylians, he feared for his Kokiri. He didn't want them to wander off outside the forest because he knew war was raging on and didn't want to put them in danger. 

Again he sense the density of Link when the mother came running into the forest. It pertained to his forest and people as well. Geurdos are a nomadic tribe, they would have just left the land for a new one if shit hit the fan. 

"
184157,"&gt;Besides, if they're going to mate with Hylian men, and Link being Hylian, wouldn't that make more sense to raise him as one of their own? They could ensure he grew into a strong warrior which would be all the better to mate with in the future, and he would be one of them instead of being a complete stranger. They probably would want to bring a man in, especially one they could shape how they wanted.

No because Nintendo would never do that, that sounds very much like grooming which is closly related to pedophilila. 

&gt;The whole point is that Hylians were forbidden from the forest

No they weren't it was the Kokiri that were forbidden in leaving the forest. Hylians can come and go as they pleased which is why adult Skultos or w/e are in the forest, they're lost adult men and women. 





"
185090,"&gt;there is absolutely nothing preventing the Gerudo from taking Link in as one of their own.

Actually there is, Hylian male boy.

&gt; Use your fucking imagination; Gerudo thieves kill his parents, aren't heartless enough to abandon a helpless child, take him in and raise him, he earns their respect as he grows into a talented warrior. Just one of a million possible scenarios if you have even an ounce of creativity in your brain.

So they would kill his parents but raise the boy because they're not that ""heartless""....no that doesn't make any sense at all.

&gt;""One day, to escape from the fires of the war, a Hylian mother and her baby boy entered this forbidden forest.""

Because people go missing in that forest, not because the Deku Tree forbids it. There is a reason why it's called the Lost forest. 
 "
186167,"FINE YOU WIN!!! LINK IS GANONDORF AS WELL BECAUSE HE'S GERUDO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
