Anyway, I really like /u/TedJustice 's theory of a Zelda where we get to know more about the goddesses and that takes place even before the events in SS.

What Aonuma has said, if he didn't just mess with us, would make for a really interesting Zelda game in my opinion. "

I don't really see a problem with not having a Link, Zelda or Ganon in the game. The way I see it, as long as it's in the Zelda universe it's a Zelda game. If they do this, they could use the game to show us more of the Zelda lore."

Anyways it's just all speculation and this is a theory that might not fit into the canon story, but I still think it would be cool to see."
