389962,"Every 4 spirit orbs you obtain nets you an upgrade on stamina or a heart. You have to visit goddess statues to receive the containers. The first main quest you receive is when you get the paraglider and it points you to Kakariko village. If you follow that questline it's pretty simple. I went around and tried to gather as much weapons as I could because that's how you ""level up"" in this game. More damge usually means better durability. Good luck and enjoy the endless exploration! I've had it since launch and about 460 hours later I still only have like 400 korok seeds"
