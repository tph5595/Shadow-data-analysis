421183,"&gt; Most towers after the first couple are impossible to climb without falling or being attacked

Cook stamina-replenishing foods or elixirs, and eat/drink them before you fall. 5 Stemella mushrooms will restore you to 200% stamina, 5 endura carrots is 300%, staminoka bass will give you 300% + 5 hearts. Cook restless crickets with bokoblin horns or moblin guts to get 100-200% stamina, 4 tireless frogs + any enemy body part is 200%. You can climb to any height if you pack enough food.

&gt;  Wtf do I do? Where do I go?

You just explore until you find things to do. There are two 'story quests' but they both involve exploring until you find the necessary places. If you want them, head to Kakariko Village and speak to Impa. She gives you the two quests, which are:

1. *Captured Memories*: find 13 sites in the world associated with Link's memory and watch the cutscenes that trigger. You speak to the painter seen in town and at stables to get clues.
2. *Free the Divine Beasts*: find 4 towns with divine beast guardians, board them, and kill the bosses infecting them.

The idea behind BOTW is that it's totally open and nonlinear. From the moment you get the hang glider, you can do any quest in any order, and all of them are 100% optional. 

When you get the hang glider, you are given the quest ""Destroy Ganon."" The game is so committed to nonlinearity that it's possible to have destroyed Ganon within 20 minutes of that, without using glitches to skip anything. If you know where to go you can head directly to Ganon the moment you're told to and kill him on your initial 3 hearts without doing any other quest. "
