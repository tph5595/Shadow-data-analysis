306352,"I constantly wore the stealth armor early game, because it made gathering food and elixir ingredients so easy. I can basically just walk up to critters and grab them (a lot of times, I don't see the critter until I'm prompted to grab it). Also, you can swim right up to fish, and walk right up to most animals (from behind)... a bonus for both hunting meat and training your first horses. Also, it's really great for avoiding hordes of monsters you might not be at a level to battle yet. If you do want to fight anyways, it makes sniping and sneak-attacking monsters is so much easier.

Near the village you bought it in, you'll encounter fairies, and they're much easier to grab with the stealth armor too. I think I have like nine right now.

I don't want to spoil anything, but later in the game there's a certain mission you have to complete before you can free the Gerudo Desert divine beast, and it's much less frustrating with the stealth armor.

Finally, looting Hyrule Castle is much less frustrating with the stealth armor when you're finally ready to go there."
