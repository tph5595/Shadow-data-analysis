280681,"I wouldn't try to uncover the whole map right away. I would follow the main quest for a bit up to the point where Impa gives you the memory &amp; beasts quests. At that point the game branches out and allows more freedom. The game nudges you Northeast but it's up to you what direction to go. In general if you wander into a harder area (like Hyrule field in front of the castle) just avoid it till you think you can handle it or find another way around.

As for difficulty, the only ways to get stronger are doing shrines (hearts/stamina), finding stronger weapons (the difficulty ramps up after you start defeating certain types of enemies but you also start finding better weapons as drops), and upgrading armor with the fairies (if you haven't found a fairy yet investigate around Kakariko village more thoroughly)."
