144415,"Hi, I'm still playing and so avoiding gameplay spoilers. Yet I must know, has there been a thread where someone scanned the maps from Breath of the Wild Explorer's Edition, and as of today, the Expanded Guide that just released?

Another question I might as well get out of the way: has ANYONE on r/zelda opted-out of downloading the DLC Part 2 for the sake of posterity? Since you can't download them individually, the only way to play Part 1 by itself and document exactly what changes were made is if you bought a ticket and have either had ""Automatic Update"" turned off, and/or had Breath of the Wild physically and have not played it since December 12th. Alternatively, anyone who bought Explorer's Edition with the DLC Pass and stopped playing before Part 2 would have this. It may not seem important but if this game has a legacy akin to OoT someday it would be a shame to lose this."
206061,Yeah but I'm still looking for a direct scan. It's not right that the best scan available is from Amazon. https://i.imgur.com/Pfw7Mpb.jpg
