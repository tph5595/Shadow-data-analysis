362391,"Doesn’t matter if you’re burning bow durability because the lowest top-tier lynel bow (32x3) is plenty strong enough to do this in combo with 3x attack power. And it takes much less than a bows full life to kill one. So no matter what you get a fresh bow that is at least as strong as the one you have, and ou can add it to your collection or just replace the one you used if you’re already full.

Durability is entirely a non issue here. 

As for arrows; I’ve never been short on arrows after the first two beasts. And the shops will auto-restock if you drop below 50. So assuming you know how to farm money, that’s entirely a non-issue as well.

People always make excuses about why chaining headshots is sub-optimal but I think they’re just trying to fight it because it feels cheap. Which is true; it’s sort of game-ruiningly simple. But it is still the easiest, fastest, and most efficient way to farm lynels."
