anyways, I know that if you come across 3 apple trees if you make them match you get a seed.  However sometimes I'll come across 3 that have 3 apples each and already match (in some random locations which leads to me to believe there's a seed there).  What do you do with these?"
271551,They're not in a perfect row but they're all close together. Maybe it's not a seed then.  I'll try and get a screenshot when I have a chance. 
387554,"I honestly don't use the stealth armor much. That said, i don't want to give any spoilers but there are some sidequests where the stealth armor is VERY handy.  


I don't like crafting much, so having the stealth armor is useful in certain situations so you don't need to worry about potions.  "
388943,"Beginning is tough, and botw is not really like any other Zelda game (maybe the first NES one comes the closest but obviously much more to do here).  


That said, yes in the beginning everything will kill you.  You need to be sneaky as to how to take out monster camps, you'll usually see boulders or an explosive barrel, etc nearby and can cause a lot of damage to them like that.  Or you need to take out the guys on watch first so they don't alert the rest. 


Some monsters, such as the open world bosses you just need to run from in the beginning.  


It gets much easier once you have more shrines where you have better weapons, etc.  


When I first started I died so many times in the beginning (and I've been playing Zelda since I had an NES as a kid when it came out, so it's not just because you're new to the series). After I beat the first divine beast, it became muuuch easier.  I haven't died since and have logged a ton of hours. 


Even still though, I make sure to have a lot of healing food on me and have to be smart about taking out certain camps.
