199607,"Grind stone taluses and take out any ore deposits you find. That is 100% less tedious than cooking. I have more diamonds than I had about 50 diamonds and sold half and have tons of sapphires and rubies. Also, farming Farosh is really easy, a little tedious, but quick dragon parts. "

And jpmondx's response didn't really make it that clear, but whatever weapon you attack with while mounting the Lynel will not take durability damage, so switch to your highest attack weapon while mounted. Should be able to get about 5 hits I believe. "
