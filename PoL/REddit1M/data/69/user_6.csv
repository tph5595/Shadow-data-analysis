18607,"Apologies in advance for a pretty common question since it was released (I just beat the main story on Switch): is the DLC fun? The cost isn't the issue, but if it's something I can hold off on doing in order to play other games, then I don't mind taking a break. I'm most interested in the Champions' Ballad specifically because I know I'm not going Korok hunting (although I understand the appeal of the mask).

Follow-up: is the Champions' Ballad more difficult (i.e., is it Master Mode), or is it the 'same' difficulty as the original story?

Thanks, all! Appreciate this community a ton!"
28584,Thanks! I appreciate the feedback. Looks like I'm going to take the plunge!
28625,"Awesome, I appreciate it! Looks like I'm going to make a purchase when I get home. The complexity of the shrines and challenges is definitely appealing.

EDIT: accidentally a word"
84888,Trial of the Sword was the other part I was interested in when it came to DLC 1. Good to know you enjoyed it because that's probably what I'll want to do first before DLC 2. Thanks!
