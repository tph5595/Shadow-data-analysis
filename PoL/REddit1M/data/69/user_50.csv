You shouldn't have to ditch your five shot, just switch to a different bow (and honestly, the goldens are so useful for dragon parts that I would recommend keeping one in your inventory anyway)."

You just have to pick it up within a certain amount of time - I think it's before 9am, but it could be that you have 24 hours. "
