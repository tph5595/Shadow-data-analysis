89918,"you can get one once a night by doing the following, which I believe is the fastest, most refined way I've found:

- go to top of dueling peaks, place travel medallion at the very top. 

- get flame weapon and have cold armor piece (just 1 works)

- camp until night

- look towards Hyrule castle all night (you don't have to watch, you can just check the landscape around 1:30am to see a yellow light pillar, which is pretty visible)*

- paraglide over to star fragment. They disappear at 5am, so if it falls after 2am, I would just try again instead of pushing your luck

- repeat


I've gotten over 15 in under an hour this way
*helps to have 3 stamina rings or hasty elixirs to run faster

If you get a 3x shot or 5x shot bow, and use 3x attack up, get a headshot, and when it's leaning over, get 3-4 more. Then, once it stands, if you get your timing right, you can headshot it right back to its stunned kneeling position. I've taken out golds this way in well under a minute"
