If you spot one, run up to him and climb on top of him because he'll get up and reveal his weak spot and you can hit him with some cheap shots or sometimes even instakill him making the fight easy as shit."

Get familiar with the combat system. Dodging attacks with jump, timing attacks and dodges specifically. This is what I did and it helped so much. 

Also keep exploring, don't feel the need to rush into the main quest objectives but I will admit that it might be worth your while eventually although it will be difficult. If you just keep roaming around, you will come across certain places and other things that will help you advance a lot. I'm not going to spoil but I've been surprised a lot. What I liked to do was look at my map, look for a place that looks a bit out of the ordinary and try to see what I can find there. I found so much cool shit that way that's a bit more ""end-game"" but kept me incredibly interested in the game."

[I have acquired some star shards (might be wrong name, I play the game in my native language) from Lynels, chests and a sidequest. Without giving away too much, can anybody give me a hint on where to go or what to do with them? I'm lost.](/spoiler)"
