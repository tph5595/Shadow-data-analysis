Just depends on what resources you want to use in the kill, which is determined by why you're killing said lynel in the first place.  The FASTEST way is to pop em with an ancient arrow, but that uses resources and sacrifices drops entirely. No wrong way to do it as long as the magnificent evil beast dies in the end."

Far Cry 3/4/primal, Just cause, Skyrim, hell GTAV?  It's an open world exploration game.  The game comes from exploring, learning about the world, uncovering the story as you go.  Have you tried the game at all or just watched someone play?"
229776,"If I had assumed you were trolling I wouldn't have answered at all, like I said.  I answered on the offchance you weren't trolling.  Have you considered doing some of the quests to see the storyline come out more?  You really need to leave the plateu (after getting the glider) for the quests to really show up.  

Its also possible you simply won't like the game, like you said, but I'd reccomend working on your phrasing if you ever want to ask a real sincere question like this.  You accused me of being egocentric, but you're stating your opinion as though it were fact, but I'm understanding that your opinion is yours through that.  Assuming your own opinion to be the truth and not being able to understand that other people think something is great even though you don't see the value in it is a far closer representation of egocentric then what I said.  However I have no evidence that you're egocentric or an asshole at all, so I'm not going to personally attack you."

I was talking about zelda there, BOTW specifically.  I would be happy to answer any more specific questions you have."
