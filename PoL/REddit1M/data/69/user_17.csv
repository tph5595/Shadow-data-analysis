114482,Like the red lynel by Zora's domain is there any location that will always have a blue lynel? I need one for my compendium and don't want to buy it 
179222,Thanks! I found it and the white one in the second gatehouse. Do you know if they drop mighty lynel gear? The one I fought didn't drop anything and I still need those for my compendium too.
182426,Are there any lynel drops in the dlc? I know you fight the blights again somewhere
