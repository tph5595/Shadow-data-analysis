446428,"I'm doing the kass shrine quest where I have to shoot an arrow between 2 rings, and I've done it multiple times, between 2 different pairs of rings, and then I looked up a guide to find the correct pair. I shot the arrow through those too, but it still didn't make the shrine work. I'm thinking it's because I have a 5 shot bow, so All the arrows are not going at once, but if the game is going to make me ditch a good bow just to open a shrine, it is bad game design. Is it because of the bow that I cannot activate the shrine?
