Don't be one of those people - targeting enemies is a staple of the series and it gives you so many more options, both combat and movement-wise.

You can sort of get by if you just run at stuff and press x, at least in normal mode, but imo it's much more clunky and less enjoyable that way."

DLC pack 2 starts near the end of the game, DLC pack 1 will give you a challenge at some point about... I want to say half way through, but since this game is almost completely non-linear it really depends what you do and where you go."
208639,"To be fair, your original post was pretty dismissive and needlessly inflammatory to begin with, and there have been plenty of people in the past who have come here to say similar things purely with the intention of trolling - so I don't really blame him for reacting that way.

If you just can't get into the game and you genuinely don't understand what people see in it, there are so many other (less abrasive) ways you could've asked."
209004,"I believe it's possible to uninstall the DLC and play the game in its original form, but I don't think you can disable DLC pack 2 while leaving pack 1 available (if that's what you were asking)."
212504,"I don't get it. You just wrote out a whole thing to the other guy about how he should try not to be so egocentric because it makes him come off as an asshole. Is there some kind of weird disconnect there, where you apply completely different standards to yourself vs others?

Read your post(s). Read everything he said in reply. Whose post is more inflammatory, who comes across as more of an asshole?"
224477,"So the game is actually very different to most games in the series and I totally get why it could be a bit overwhelming at first.

One thing to note is that the game is almost completely non-linear and you don't necessarily *have* to be doing anything in particular. If you haven't at least gone and done the sequence of quests involving Impa, it's worth doing those - but otherwise, the world really is your oyster.

But you're actually not limited in any way once you've left the great plateau. You can actually go anywhere and do pretty much anything in the game with the toolset you currently have - it just will be more difficult to survive with low hearts, and you'll have trouble climbing for very long without stamina upgrades. So it's possible to climb those towers, you just might have to be creative in your approach and/or work out a way to take down enemies guarding them.

Having done multiple playthroughs of the game now, I can say that you'll inevitably make progress in one form or another no matter which direction you run off in - you'll run into enemy camps which will drop better weapons, or find a tower to unlock a portion of the map, or you'll come across shrines for spirit orbs and weapon upgrades.

My opinion? Instead of worrying about what you *should* be doing, just do whatever you *want* to do. Play around with game mechanics, head towards whatever looks interesting on the horizon and see what happens along the way! There isn't really a wrong way to play this game and everyone's experience is different. Honestly no matter which direction you head in, everything will work itself out in the end."

One thing I'll say is, just from watching a few of my friends play, I've noticed lots of people play the game while literally never targeting enemies with ZL. Don't be one of those people - targeting enemies is a staple of the series and it gives you so many more options of movement and combat in general.

Also try varying your approach. Instead of running at enemies, maybe approach from a distance with a couple of shots with a bow first before closing the distance and going in for sword swings. Watch their attack patterns and see how they telegraph their attacks - you'll start to get a feel for what they're going to do and how you might avoid it. If they do a horizontal swing, you can backflip to avoid it. If they do a vertical swing, you can hop to the left or right. If you do this with perfect timing, you'll even activate a ""flurry rush"" which is like a bullet time mode which gives you an opportunity for several free hits."

469432,"I think it adds a decent amount of content to the game. 

It gives the option of a second (more difficult) playthrough, an interesting challenge about halfway through the game, plus a whole extra section of content that opens towards the end of the game. There are also a bunch of extra cosmetic armour sets and other helpful items scattered throughout the world that he might enjoy finding."
549980,"I guess just explain to her that you can press ZL to center the camera directly behind Link, and that ZL is also the target button. 

Side note worth mentioning: locking on to enemies by pressing and holding ZL is great for keeping your camera where you want it to be, and it gives you so many more options of movement/combat. I bring this up because having watched several friends/family members play the game, it's alarming how many people go through the game while literally never targeting enemies.

Otherwise, she'll just need practice manually controlling the camera with the right stick. After a while it becomes second nature to just adjust the camera on the fly, but it might take some getting used to if she hasn't played many games that have camera control."
561673,"Honestly, I doubt I could find it. Nintendo doesn't really release detailed patch notes anyway, so there wouldn't be any official documentation of changes made to the game.

I probably just saw it in the middle of a discussion in passing."
