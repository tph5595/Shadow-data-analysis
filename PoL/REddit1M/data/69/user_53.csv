- In Kakariko Village, you can buy Sheikah armor that will make you silent and make you move twice as fast at nighttime, so you can sneak around and kill everyone under cover of night.
- Don't neglect food. It can not only restore health and add attack or defense buffs, but over-fill your health and stamina. Any food with 'hearty' in the name can heal you beyond 100%. You can cook a hearty steamed fish dish from fish, radishes, and truffles that heals you to 100% *and* adds 19 bonus hearts to your health meter -- so right now you could have 22 hearts.
- Sneak attack enemies. If you can sneak up slowly behind an enemy you can press attack to one-shot them with a blow to the head.
- Use your bombs. Throw them off cliffs, tumble them down hills. Drop them on the ground then flee past them, luring enemies into the blast radius. 
- Use the environment. Arrows and wooden weapons can catch fire, then they deal bonus damage, set enemies on fire, and insta-kill ice enemies. If you have an electric weapon, lure enemies into the water to hit them all at the same time. In a thunderstorm, throw metal objects into water and lure enemies into it, and lightning will kill them. 
- If you dodge an enemy attack at the last second you will go into bullet time, and can pull off an inescapable combo.
- The professor in Hateno Village will upgrade your stasis power so you can freeze enemies.
- You can headshot enemies which, if it's a sneak attack, often one-hit-kills them."

613437,"Apples and wood are some of the most efficient fuels. There's a huge orchard near Mt Satori that contains ~100 apples on ~20 trees, surrounded by smaller non-fruit-bearing trees, all of which replenish every blood moon. Head there, totally destroy the place with bombs, and grab everything off the ground. It takes 5 minutes and provides enough material for about 10 full tanks.

1 apple, wood, bokoblin/moblin/lizalof horn or talon, chuchu jelly = 10% of a tank. That's the strongest stuff. Rare high quality items are actually worse -- dragon horns/scales only do 2%. Putting in a fairy or ancient core does double the effect of everything else you put in, and the effect does stack, but it's never worth it. Just run your bike on apples and wood, they're efficient and easily replenishable."
613914,"You're doing it right. Basic ancient things (ancient screw, spring, gear, shaft -- just not cores), basic enemy parts (mokoblin, bokoblin, lizalfos horns/guts/talons, keese wings, chuchu jelly), apples, wood, flint, amber, Hylian shrooms, salt, and blue nightshade are the most efficient fuels, each restoring 10% of a tank, and they're also the most easily-replenishable items. It's designed to run on common easy to find stuff. Rare special items like dragon parts, hearty fruit/fish, Lynel and Hinox parts are actually much *less* efficient, to discourage players from wasting them.

There's a massive orchard near Mt Satori that will have ~30 trees and ~100 apples, regrowing every blood moon. I just go there and harvest it by blasting bombs and running around grabbing stuff off the ground, and that fills my tank 10 times."
614306,"[You can. The Master Sword is totally optional, as are the divine beasts. They only work to make the fight easier. By default Ganon has a ton of health. The Master Sword does double damage and won't break, and every divine beast you complete will knock 1/8th of his health off. So having the Master Sword + all 4 divine beasts makes Ganon about a quarter as hard. But you can still kill him perfectly fine using tree branches from the plateau if you have the patience and dodging skill.](/spoiler)

[I killed Ganon without the Master Sword and with only 2 beasts complete when I unintentionally walked into his boss room while looking for Hyrule Castle's shrine.](/spoiler)"

True, but it's not that big a deal IMO. You go through maybe 100 rupees worth of arrows and 1/4 a bow to score what is IIRC is the most bountiful drop in the game. And by the time you're fighting the harder Lynels 100 rupees is nothing."

Late reply, but... I'm still really really eager/hopeful to see the past Zelda games on the Switch, for a few reasons. Yeah, you can play them on past consoles, but only the Wii U can play all of them, and it doesn't do them all well (the DS and 3DS games have ~192x144 or ~420x250 resolution and look awful on TVs), plus Wii Us are the rarest console and increasingly expensive, and the games are out of print in some regions. I would really love to see the Zelda back catalogue released on the Switch, portable and at native resolution. I'd happily pay $30 a pop just for straight ports, let alone remasters. (Spirit Tracks and Phantom Hourglass would need some remastering to dodge the stylus and microphone requiring features but other than that I don't think there'd be any problems.)

My dream is an Ocarina/Majora/Wind Waker/Twilight Princess anthology on Switch that lets you toggle between the original graphics and the remake graphics, just running at native res."
615854,"&gt;  Zelda has had a completely different name each entry.

Nitpick tangent: A Link Between Worlds is called A Link to the Past 2 in Japan. (Or more properly, ALTTP was called ""Triforce of the Gods"" and ALBW was called ""Triforce of the Gods 2."")"
