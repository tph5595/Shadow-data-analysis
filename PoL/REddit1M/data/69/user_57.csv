548169,you have to do quests to get things started and maybe to avoid this in the future test a game out at target or something before buying or watch a youtube play through of a quest so you can know what you’re buying and if it’s for you. 
548377,also i’d suggest getting the armor as soon as possible if you’re interested in using it a lot bc as your character progresses the armor from the dlc becomes kind of useless in comparison to other armor
548594,i still love stealth armor and i’ve played through the game three times. it’s super useful especially if you decide to complete the compendium (hope i spelled that right lol)
