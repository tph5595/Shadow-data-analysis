22958,"Even if you agree with the idea of including pronouns in a fictional space that has no need for them, it is pure speculation. We don't know what their preferred pronouns would be. The people who would argue for inclusion of correct pronouns would also argue against the idea of assigning pronouns where the preferred ones are not known.

So yes, please keep the Zelda universe clear of this sort of thing until the very moment that a character expresses their desired pronouns."
