13614,"Is the new information less accurate? People will just read the wiki and see ""she"" and correctly figure they are female. Or people who rather focus on the pronouns will also find out what they want.

I guess my question is... who loses because of this change?

idk It's a video game and I don't see why this is an issue from either side of the argument."
28820,"I understand your example of ambiguous genders, but It's also clear on the Wiki that Zelda is Sheik.

I can't possibly think of a situation where someone thinking Sheik is a man would ever lead to anything... bad, embarrassing, or anything really "
103207,"&gt; I would then think that either he is a male... [an] inaccurate interpretation

&gt; ...although the persona of Shiek *is* a male.

I feel like you might be making a good point, but I'm just be reading it incorrectly. 

You said it yourself that it can't be summarized in a single word so I don't see how calling Shiek ""a he"" or ""a male"" is really any different from one another. ""Zelda is a female"" and ""Zelda is a she"" have identical meaning to me, and I'm sure I'm not the only one. As with nearly *every* fictional character, you can pretty safely assume cisgendered unless clearly stated otherwise."
103503,"Well it's not listing their ""preferred"" pronouns actually, just the pronouns used to refer to them in-game. Sheik's changed in between games and is listed as so."
103990,"I guess I'd argue which is more relevant information when talking about the character. ""Is Link he or she?"" is a lot more important to know than ""Does Link have a penis or a vagina?"""
104283,"I don't think calling a character a ""he"" necessarily means that character identifies as a man. Even though Sheik is a woman in disguise, being called ""he"" in OoT shows that other characters perceived Sheik as male which I think is an pretty important aspect of the character and the disguise."
