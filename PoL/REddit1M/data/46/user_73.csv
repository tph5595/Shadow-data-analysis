242490,"I don't quite get this. People are posting the idea that this is ""politically correct"". But why/how?  
A male is a genetic code and female is genetic code. And the phrases him/her refur to the genetic code.  
  
This is furthering my theory that society is turning to a point of equality beyond equality; where women are not alloud to get pregnate because men can't get pregnate and urinals get banned from men's bathrooms because women can't use them."
