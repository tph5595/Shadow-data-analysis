1268,"Is there any evidence that this is done by the Wiki Administration and not just some random person who decided to edit the Wiki?

I agree. While I see the concern with gender/sex/identity, I think that the character's in the game don't really have a sexual identity. Link, in it's canonical form, is a Male. Ganondorf is the sole male heir in a female dominated race. Zelda is a female.

Anything else you assign to them is up to you. 

It could be an easy fix to change Gender to  ""Biological Sex: Male/Female/Unknown/(Insert Other Options)"""

96551,"It's not that it would lead to anything bad, it's just inaccurate. Especially as the change is intended to bring more accuracy, when in reality it makes it more confusing.

Wiki's aren't designed for people who know everything already. That is literally the opposite audience for Wiki's. If I were completely ignorant of the series, which I am for many other series that I visit wiki's for, I would see Shiek and see the pronoun as He. I would then think that either he is a male, or that he is transgender and identifies as a he. Both are inaccurate interpretations. Shiek still is still Zelda who is still a female, although the persona of Shiek is a male. Cross-dressing and disguise is not the same as transgender and almost the opposite. It is a special case and can't be accurately summarized in a single word.

Even the case which the moderator rests upon is shakey and does not warrant a full wiki wide change. If the team feels that it is important to make the pronoun distinction, it needs to also recognize that it is giving innacurate/incomplete information. We know many of the characters are likely cisgendered. Nintendo has given no indication otherwise, and it is a misrepresentation of a series, however minor."
160084,"The difference is in the implication. It gives the impression that all characters need to be addressed in this way because there are a lot of cross-gender roles and it's important to the story to know that. There is more potential confusion because, like you said every fictional character in this universe is cisgendered (barring 2 or 3 questionable cases like Shiek, Calamity Ganon, Fi etc).

Furthermore, if we're all assuming everyone is cisgendered according to their pronoun, how is that any more politically correct or culturally sensitive than simply saying female or male. Effectively, by saying they are equal interpretations, you are also arguing that the pronoun change did not need to be made.

Basically, the pronouns give an extra layer of ambiguity, an expectation that the change was necessary and provides useful information. Through the Shiek example, we can see that even in the case that it is supposed to help, it is still lacking. The best solution is to keep the field as it was, either changing gender to biological sex if we want to be more politically correct, or keeping gender and addressing special cases on a case by case basis (On Shiek it would say Female (see Below)"
