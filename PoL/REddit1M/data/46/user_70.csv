189779,"I haven't noticed this until recently (I mostly go on the wiki for details on items and locations for my perpetual Hyrule Warriors ideas). Seemed like a pointless thing to have in the first place when it was still gender (maybe good for some out-of-the-box examples like Gohma), and then having them change it to pronouns for a few flimsy examples... I don't like to attribute to malice what stupidity can cover, but it does seem like there was a concentrated effort to make this policy as low-key as possible and then counter every challenge afterwards with 'there was a vote'. Also, when I read the original vote, it DOES seem like there was a majority against the action, but it still got pushed through anyway...

I'm wondering if this will explode like Silent Hill wiki's infamous circumcision debate; Zelda wiki's pronoun debate doesn't have quite the same punch however..."
