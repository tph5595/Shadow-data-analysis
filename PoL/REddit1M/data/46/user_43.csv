33249,Zelda Universe and Zelda Wiki are managed by a bunch of immature fucks. The owner couldn't manage a personal tumblr page to save his life. Low quality garbage

80901,You're telling me. The entire lot is messed up.

This theme is now super laggy and old, but they spent so much and insist on keeping it around. That leaves the site looking like a run-down 2002 meets modern responsive abortion."
