It's making something ambiguous that isn't and doesn't need to be. It's not added clarity, it's less clarity.

I think the biggest hold up is really that it was basically one guy that decided the entire change and technically the vote he held actually went against it but he did it anyways. If the community wanted it to be done that's a different story but it's pretty clear they thought it was unnecessary purely based on the lack of interest in the vote."
21821,"&gt; My overall question is: why is this being discussed here? I read the sidebar earlier and it's clear I'm in the wrong sub, I'll be popping into /r/truezelda I guess. I just don't think the Zelda wiki is really what should be within top 5 posts on this sub. Specifically, because this isn't really about Zelda. To me this belongs somewhere in a meta discussion of wikis, not here. I agree the community has every right to be as angry as they like, but I don't see why it's on reddit. I was mostly just here for killer fan art and tattoos, and watching for announcements of games, or discussing the games.

Honestly, if the people here didn't want to discuss it, it wouldn't be one of the top threads. I agree that it is a little out of place here but if it got posted and people are discussing it clearly it struck a chord with some of the users. You have every opportunity to not click on the thread or to decide to ignore it (as I was originally going to do, but then I got bored) if you don't want to be seeing this kind of thing.

subreddits *can* occasionally go off topic with posts and still generate some good discussion. I don't really see this thread as much of an issue."
24424,"Hm? I'm not against you or anything and I get that you're playing devil's advocate but at the same time you can't get rattled when you say that you don't know if this really belongs here and someone says it belongs just fine and if you don't want to see it don't click it, it's a completely valid thing to say. 

Of course you're allowed to discuss whether it belongs here, just as someone else is allowed to speculate that it does. I specifically worded my response in that manner because you said you come here to look at fun things like tattoos and such, which you can still do just fine by ignoring all the politically charged stuff if you so choose.

I get it man. I play devil's advocate on here all the time but quite frankly it just isn't effective when conversing with like 99% of redditors because they seem to live in this bubble where you should only be exposed to things you agree with. Getting someone on here to be genuinely invested in what you have to say is like trying to shoot a particular raindrop out of the sky during a storm. You're pretty much shooting in the dark and hoping to get lucky. This entire site is structured to support everyone's bubble as well, as long as you think in the same manner as the majority at least.
