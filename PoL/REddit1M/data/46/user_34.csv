20553,"It's a clarity thing. Saying some is male/female/unknown is a lot clearer. They have a penis/vagina/whatever-the-fuck, got it. 

By switching to pronouns, it can make people overthink the character by trying to interpret what gender they identify as, adding an artificial layer to a character's complexity. Zelda's characters, like most of Nintendo's other properties, are meant to be relatively simple and easy to understand (with a few exceptions). 

Link is the male hero vs. Link is the hero who identifies as male, which one is clearer and simpler?

Yeah, it's a little trivial and no one really loses, it's more of people not wanting to turn nothing into something. Keep the gender/sex stuff that comes with fandoms out of Nintendo properties, you know?"
