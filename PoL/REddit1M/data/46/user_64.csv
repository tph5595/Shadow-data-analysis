117971,"I think most of what you're getting is annoyance rather than hate.

Everyone knows the character of sheik was supposed to be Zelda in disguise and was a ""big reveal"" later on in the game. People aren't mad because a subject involves gender identity issues, they're annoyed because it really doesn't. "
