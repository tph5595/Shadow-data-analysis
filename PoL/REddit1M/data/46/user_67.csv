If someone looks feminine, I use she/her, if someone looks masculine, I use he/him. This may be a bit harsh, but if you're that insecure about getting misgendered, you yourself might be the problem. I can relate to that, I have been called a she/her/girl on numerous occassions in my angsty teenage phase, it was definitely uncomfortable getting misgendered. But those problems stemmed from my insecurities, not from everyone else around me."
207637,"Meh, we also use a single set of pronouns for objects in the English language. That doesn't get really confusing or is a pain in the ass, is it? So no, I don't think clarity is hurt that bad. They don't really remove issues, they are unnecessary. It's in the same vein that you don't have to declare the skin colour of someone every time you refer to him/her."
208132,"I don't see how it would treat them more equal. It's already pretty silly that we make a pronoun distinction between man and woman. I just use 'he' for masculine and 'she' for feminine features. And again, it's silly to think that me not wanting to use correct pronouns means that I think you're less equal.

Honestly, how much does it come up in conversation anyway, since I already barely use he/she/him/her. I mostly talk in second person. Maybe I'm wrong and pronouns are significant in someone's self-image, and I should adjust my opinion accordingly, but so far I'm sceptical."
