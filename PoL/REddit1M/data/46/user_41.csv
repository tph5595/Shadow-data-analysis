27921,"I'm not against a person using different pronouns if they have a particular gender identity. That said, the people who made this happen need to take a look outside of their little world bubbles. Changing an entire wiki to use only pronouns - a wiki that's meant to provide accurate information - is just wrong. Zelda Wiki has a tendency to do stupid things though. I actually joined it several years ago to try and help clean some things up, but they have ridiculous policies that in my opinion have adverse effects on the ability for average Zelda players to get accurate information. There was little I could do to fight those policies because the staff had their heads up their asses."
