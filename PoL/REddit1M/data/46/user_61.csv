113491,It's useless and unimportant what color my neighbor's house is. I would be pissed if he repainted it every two weeks.

135502,Really? Because it's being put up on the Zelda wiki. I don't go there to hear about it.
146600,"I don't browse the Zelda wiki often. But yes, I would have eventually noticed. Nintendo games often have sexually ambiguous or questionable characters. Birdo, Tingle, Samus before she took off her helmet, etc. And for the most part, their appearances are what we would use to determine pronouns."
149442,"Birdo uses feminine pronouns. And I suppose Tingle was a bad example, yeah. What about Sheik? Zelda used masculine pronouns when disguised but was definitely still female."
152585,"My point is that it is very rare that a person will prefer masculine pronouns and dress feminine, or vice versa, but it is relatively common for a person to be male and dress feminine. Therefore, sex is harder to infer."
