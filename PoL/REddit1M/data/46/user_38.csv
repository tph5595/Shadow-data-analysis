23188,Zelda is not a they. Zelda is a she.  People are ignorant.
23339,"The main pages I noticed that got hit were Zelda, Shiek, and Link.  Why are people being completely retarded about this?  Zelda and Shiek are shes, and Link is a he."
24630,"I don't understand why adding preferred pronouns to FICTIONAL characters makes anything clearer.  Including changing EVERY pronoun in the articles to they.

The articles are basically globs of confusion now."
25512,"For now they have their gender/sex, but how long until it's all they?  
But once they are all theys, the articles are going to be very hard to read.

I don't think it makes sense for Link.  Every Link is a he still so that pronoun still makes the most sense with the least amount of confusion."
