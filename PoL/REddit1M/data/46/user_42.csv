It is a way to escape from all the draining bullshit that we have to deal with in our everyday lives, including politics. Link is a Male. In this politically correct society, that just isn't enough. Political correctness is bullshit and any person that takes part in it and enables it is a person I do not want to associate with. Go be politically correct somewhere else. The Legend of Zelda isn't about political correctness. It never has been and it never will."
