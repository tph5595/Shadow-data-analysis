8266,"For example on Link's page it lists all of his different characteristics and instead of there Gender (Male) it lists ""what pronouns they prefer"". That kind of thinking usually only lines up with tumblr/stereotypical SJW type ideologies. By replacing gender with pronouns it looses the sights credibility because only tumblr, a pretty infamous site, cares about pronouns. This is a wiki. It's purpose is to inform without any bias on political views and should only present things in an objective manner. By presenting pronouns, it looses the objectivity by seemingly trying to be too politically correct. "
