12247,"I am cisgender, and I used to frequent tumblr a looooot, especially the SJW sphere. I'm curious: I always thought it was individuals who did not identify as cis who would designate pronouns. When have any of the characters, in dialogue or game guide, ever indicated they identify as anything besides their presumed genders? Link being male, Zelda female, etc. I feel like doing the gender to pronoun change was needless and if anything would send the wrong message to people who never played the games but are researching them. For these uninformed individuals, their take-away from the Wiki will be that the Zelda Universe is populated SOLELY by transgender individuals. Given that is not the case at all, that could cause major confusion and possible backlash on the games themselves, the developers, the wiki staff, or any online forum for Zelda. This isnt politically correct, it is simply useless and can possibly have ramifications down the road. If something isnt broken, why try to fix it?"
19604,"Oh! I did not know that it was becoming more popular to do that. That is interesting, thank you for informing me. Although it does seem like something that applies best in a conversational situation, moreso than designation of fictional characters and stuff. Like, when you meet someone, you want to know what you can call them so as to not offend them mistakenly, meanwhile with well-known fictional characters, it's safe to assume what was presented by the writers is fact.     
     
In this particular case, attempts to popularize pronoun familiarity I think misfire. I feel like a video game community and forum for lore is neither apt nor terribly safe for any kind of progressive change. Not to suggest Zelda fans or the wiki is not progressive of course! Zelda fans all come from incredibly diverse backgrounds and upbringings, so I could never put a label on the community as a whole. But I think attempting this sort of dialogue and change in a medium like the internet is not a good idea just because things can go from calm discourse to DOXing with a single news article covering the issue."
