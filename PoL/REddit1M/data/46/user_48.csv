56385,"I'm honestly very confused about what the goal of such a change actually is. At best this seems like trivia, rather than actual information relevant to the info box. At most, you could maybe make the argument that Fi probably should be categorization as something like R2D2 is, as having feminine programming. 

If anything, saying what pronouns they use only makes the issue more confusing, rather than clear. Zelda probably didn't identify as a man while she was running around as Sheik, and it makes no sense to suggest otherwise.
