0,"The [Zelda Wiki](http://zeldawiki.org/) is changing character genders to their pronouns.

Instead of Gender: Male/Female/Unknown, they replaced it with Pronoun: him/her. Now, while personally I think this is a bad idea because it's very ""un-Wiki"" of it, I'd like to see what Reddit thinks.

**Edit:** Might as well weigh these in here, I think the guy who suggested it was a Tumblr SJW. Also, only 10 people voted when the forums asked, and since very few people actually commented I'm going to go an a whim and say it was because almost nobody gave a shit. Also, it was a matter which should have been a matter between Wiki Team staff ONLY! And only 4 voted, 2 for and 2 against. Excluding the guy who suggested it it was 1 for and 2 against. The moral of the story is nobody gives a shit about pronouns. 

Also, before you say ""why not have both"" it would really just be clutter to have both.

2. Yes. It's clearer to have genders than pronouns. "

Now, I can in no way endorse or support witch hunting... but Incan't stop you. Just try and use this information for research purpose only."

7617,"Yes, by removing other accurate information, the gender. Also, pronouns would only matter for a MINORITY of characters. Not like the gay population sized minority, I mean like 5 people out of hundreds minority."
8013,"I think pronouns shouldn't be on every page. On FEW pages such as Shiek (since it's Zelda in a disguise) where she went under male pronouns because fake identity.

On characters who have clearly defined genders, such as Rarau, it's unnecessary. He uses male pronouns and it's not disputed otherwise. Pronouns have no place on his Zelda Wiki page."
9296,"I've seen this before. We call it MOAHSS. Moderator-Of-A-Huge-Subreddit-Syndrome. This may be a forum/Wiki but it applies. Either a moderator/admin will lose interest and quit (me, example) or they will go power mad and think they are in control.

The term MOAHSS as I recall was coined by my friend /u/Mizuneko-chan"

A motto I live by. *(clicks fingers and puts them in a pointing motion)*"
15706,"If a Zelda character was trans I'm certain their character bio would say ""Gender: Transgender (Male to Female)"" or something like that. With no need for pronouns."

69911,It removes accurate information and replaces it with something that makes it look like Tumblr-SJW bait.

Poor robot, unaware he's being used in the SJW agenda."
