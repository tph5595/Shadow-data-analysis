15338,"I mean, conservative estimates put trans people at around 1% of the population, which is about as many people as there are in Australia. 
It doesn't really remove any information. We're getting the canonical information (the game refers to them as he/she/they) without any assumption placed on it.
Personally, considering Nintendo very specifically makes Link androgynous and ambiguous (I know they said he was male, but that's a footnote on ""we wanted people to think is he a boy or a girl""), I don't see why everyone is so worked up over it."
15463,"Actually, lots of people encourage using pronouns instead of gender as a way to indicate your gender presentation to others, so that it becomes a more normal thing to do. There's nothing weird about cis people designating their pronouns.
It's an incredibly minor change that makes some people feel more comfortable and transmits the same information equally as effectively, really."
16523,"Which immediately singles it out as a separate category which, in 8/10 contexts, is unnecessary.
Hence, using pronouns, instead of gender (especially male, female, and ""transgender"" which is inappropriate categorisation) puts everything on the same level at an overview. "
20084,"Well, the unfortunate truth is that people who are against social changes like this are out there (and in here, mind you) and want to escalate these things so that they won't be taken seriously.
I agree that it's more important conversationally, and interpersonally, but I think that using it for things like this can serve to normalise it, and eventually I'd hope that we have some kind of system across the board that is inclusive of everyone.
I have no misconceptions about how Nintendo is presenting their characters, but to say this sort of thing is inadvisable on the Internet is, while not untrue, something I can't agree with. The Internet is no longer just a platform, but a part of life, and so you can't just keep things out of it. What I really don't understand is how so many angrily transphobic people like Link, a character who is so deliberately androgynous and not adherent to gender norms."
205854,"They also serve to distinguish between people while talking shorthand. Single pronouns remove some issues, but can make clarity a pain in the ass."
216381,"It's much more common to be referring to a lot of people by pronouns than it is to refer to a lot of objects. I personally don't think we gain much from cutting down on personal pronouns, though I think ordered rather than gendered pronouns is interesting. Too late to change though, I think"
