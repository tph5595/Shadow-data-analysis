10173,People sure love to shit on things they supposedly find 'useless and unimportant'.
12832,Precisely what I said. It's useless and unimportant. Why bother? Why care? Who gives a shit?
51766,"No, that's not it. Don't pretend like you don't understand. All of you people who shit on this kind of things say you do because ""it's irrelevant and it's not important"". Yet it seems to make you irrationally angry... Which is crazy right, for something that you supposedly don't care about at all?"
131206,"But... Why would you? Mind your own business, why would it bother you?!"
134753,"Oh but, contrary to your painting neighbor comparison, you can totally chose not to hear about all that shit."
139448,"&gt;I'm really annoyed that we have to put up with this political bullshit that doesn't matter at all in the long run.

That's kind of my point. You really don't have to put up with this political bullshit if you chose to just ignore it. You're the one making it political by raging about something that most people wouldn't even have noticed."
140666,"&gt; Really? Because it's being put up on the Zelda wiki. I don't go there to hear about it.

Let's be honest for two seconds here: if this post didn't highlight it, you wouldn't even have noticed."

Tingle, sexually ambiguous? He's weird as fuck, but there's no question about his gender whatsoever.

Besides, we certainly won't determine pronouns using their appearance, but what we know about them. Birdo's a dude, Samus a chick. End of story."
152046,"Oh yeah, if I remember correctly, Birdo was a male originally but in more recent game is supposed to be a female? And Sheik is using a masculine pronoun in order to make him pass as a guy, because she's in disguise.

In any way, I still don't see the trouble in this ""problem""... If there is confusion because of this, it's because it's already confused, like with Birdo..."
