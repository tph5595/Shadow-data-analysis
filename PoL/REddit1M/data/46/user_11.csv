7703,"I'm so disappointed to see fellow Zelda fans downvote the person who said they're happy about this


As a trans person... Who fucking cares. It's a video game, specifically a Nintendo game. It doesn't really need to be changed at all.

That being said, I think Pronouns are a good idea for clarity. She/he used in certain ways can actually be grammatically incorrect, where as with pronouns you only sacrifice syllables. It's a pointless change IMO, but whatever.

But I don't understand this backlash towards it either. Does it affect anybody? Not really.

I think they should have just changed it to ""Sex: Male"" and ""Sex: Female""

Also, please don't relate anybody who cares about gender issues to the insane SJWs on tumblr. I for one am not like them, and associating all people who care about gender issues to them is wildly unfair.

It's such a slight change I really don't see why there needed to be a post on it. So you could voice your dislike of tumblrina SJWs? I don't see the point.  "
8500,"Yeah but I don't understand why it matters at all. Does it affect you? Not really. If you read the wiki a lot I suppose it does, but other than added clarity, why the hold up on it?"
8581,"If people still leave the page alone about it, make it assigned sex. The solution to this was way easier than they made it"
8869,"Saying ""only Tumblr cares about pronouns"" is pretty disingenuous. Lots of trans people care about pronouns a great deal.

I'm guessing you aren't trans so you don't know what it's like to experience dysphoria. Some people have it worse than others. I'm trans and I don't personally give a flying fuck about pronouns. People can call me him or her or my name or a baby version of my name or a female version of my name or asshole or dyke or whatever. I don't care what people call me, what matters to me is if I'm an asshole or not in truth. But some trans people care a great deal, and not all trans people are tumblr SJWs. Tumblr users are the most extreme and vocal group (of the tumblr users that are SJWs) but certainly not the only people who care about pronouns.

I'm fairly certain I know some cis people who would care if I called them a her if they're a straight male, as well. ;)"
10659,"Well, we don't know EVERY gender. There are ambiguous or sexless characters in the universe. It's usually implied though, yes.

But yeah I definitely agree. If you see my other comment you'll see I do; this is a pointless change ultimately, and the change made wasn't even the change most trans people would want to see.

But ultimately I'd like to see a little less.. Brigading and negativity and stereotyping and hate on this sub. That's mostly my point"
20502,"If you read my other comments you'll see I absolutely agree with you. It shouldn't have been done at all, it's stupid and I think reverting it would be absolutely fine.

I originally said ""If you read the wiki a lot I suppose it does, but other than added clarity, why the hold up on it?""
By this I meant to be asking OP, other than his wanting of added clarity (by reverting changes), why the hold up on it? I suppose I wasn't being clear by not using proper nouns for the ideas I was conveying. Funny that! I didn't mean to imply that ""Preferred Pronouns:"" is adding clarity. Typically in writing, adding a pronoun to a sentence adds clarity, which I mention in my other comment as well. ""I'm friends with John, Macy, and Tom. He goes to the store quite often."" --&gt; ""I'm friends with John, Macy, and Tom. Tom goes to the store quite often."" adds clarity. Obviously, I still disagree with ""preferred pronouns""

I think the obvious solution is either saying ""assigned sex"" or ""sex"" instead of gender. If it's reverted back to just ""gender"" that's fine with me, I don't care.

My overall question is: why is this being discussed here? I read the sidebar earlier and it's clear I'm in the wrong sub, I'll be popping into /r/truezelda I guess. I just don't think the Zelda wiki is really what should be within top 5 posts on this sub. Specifically, because this isn't *really* about Zelda. To me this belongs somewhere in a meta discussion of wikis, not here. I agree the community has every right to be as angry as they like, but I don't see why it's on reddit. I was mostly just here for killer fan art and tattoos, and watching for announcements of games, or discussing the games."
20794,"I'm honestly not trying to be that argumentative, but; Birdo ring a bell?"
22891,"And I discussed it with them, because I wanted to. That's fine, but am I not allowed to ask that question while discussing?

I think this topic got lifted (top of ""hot"") because the title was a bit click-baity. It's a controversial topic, especially these days, and the comments were a bit odd so I commented on both.

I don't really mean to say that I care that much about the thread. It's out of place, but again like this entire discussion I don't care. What I do care about are people lacking logic or scapegoating people I identify as. See: ""the only people who care about gender issues are tumblr SJWs"" (being that I care about gender issues, not that I'm a tumblr user.)

It's not that I care about this really; it's just that I'm obstinate and like discussion. Instead what I get is downvoted for discussing it, and like your comment ""don't click on it if you don't like it."" I like discussing things, and I intend to. I'm *all* for good discussion, like I hope I made clear, but I get the impression that either A) I'm not making myself clear, which to me trying to make myself clearer leading to people think I'm overly-invested in this, or B) People are getting stuck on me being being devils-advocate."
25089,"Like I said below, I didn't mean to imply it makes it more clear.

But globs of confusion? I don't see how any of these pages are more confusing based on one change. A change, I might add, not made on all characters. Saria, for example, still has Gender: Female.

Which article are you talking about? If the pronoun is preferred as he/him, then they would use he/him in the article.

If you're referring to Link's page, they do that because Link appears in more than one game, and thus there are multiple Links. They is more appropriate."
25529,"&gt;You can't get rattled

I'm not, I'm asking a question in a thread. I'm asking if this really belongs here; I don't see anywhere where that's against the rules or implies that I'm upset about it. Asking a question entails no feelings, you're reading into it.

&gt;tattoos and such
I specifically made this remark because that's not at /r/truezelda. What I meant by this is that I'd rather be here, but still think this click baitey title about a wiki, barely related to Zelda, shouldn't be here. Sorry for the confusion there; all I meant was that I don't care about shitposting, I care about politically charged drivel interfering in a subreddit about a video game.

&gt;Getting someone on here to be genuinely invested in what you have to say is like trying to shoot a particular raindrop out of the sky during a storm.

Yup"
26444,"I don't think you get Preferred Pronouns.

Let's look at [Sheik's](http://zeldawiki.org/Sheik) page, specifically because she/he has two pronouns listed and Sheik only appears in Ocarina of Time. Every use of the word ""they"" that I skimmed over in the ""Biography"" page was referring to Link and Sheik in a pair. Thus, they is appropriate.

Other than that the page uses ""He"" for most of the page, due to the fact that Sheik is male (even if it's Zelda in disguise) in canon. The Persona of Sheik, is male. You can't deny that, that's known before this whole battle. The page read so before, all the admins changed on the page was instead of ""Gender"" like on Saria's page, they put in ""Preferred Pronouns.""

On Link's page every time ""they"" is used the writer is referring to ALL of the Link's collectively. Example:
""They are chosen by the Godesses to protect the land from evil wherever they deemed necessary.""

Later in the article, it reads ""Link starts his journey as a child or young adolescent Hylian and has not yet been depicted as being older than his late teens at any point of the series. ""

So, in summation:
I don't know what you're talking about. 

Preferred pronouns act like this: ""Hi! I'm transfemale. My preferred pronouns are she/her/herself. Or you can call me by my name, Lucy!""
People would then proceed to call her Lucy, or when referring to her in the third person, say her/she etc. Or, someone might say something like, ""Did you see Lucy's new hair?"" ""No, where did they get it done?""
I absolutely agree, they is less clear here. But it is acceptable. *However,* I have yet to find a case like this in the entire pages that have been changed on the wiki.

Pronouns take the place of a noun in a sentence. There are three types of pronouns: Subject, Object, and Posessive. They is usually only used in the Subjective type, where ""he"" and ""she"" also falls into.

Edit: I'd also like to make a point that they don't use ""Sex"" only ""Gender"" and ""Preferred pronouns.""

I think it should just be ""sex"" to end this pointless debate"
31079,"&gt;I'm 100% positive Nintendo intends every character to be the gender that they portray them to be.

Hey man, I didn't make the 100% guarantee. Downvote me all you want, Birdo is that 1%. There's also characters that are purposely ambiguous so that both males and females will play them. They use androgyny as a design choice, and I hate to break it to you, but Link is fairly androgynous."
91275,I... Guess? I don't see much of a difference. I think that's pretty opinion based
123279,"Which I understand. And like I said, the issue should be nonexistent.

I'm a trans person, as mentioned in my previous comments, and I see no issue with how the wiki was.

I'm getting hate and annoyance. The private messages calling me a man in a dress is hate (hilarious hate because I haven't even begun transitioning or presenting female yet). The downvotes regardless of me contributing to discussion and playing advocates is annoyance. You're correct in that sense for sure.

I'm not sure where I say people are mad about the topic though. I said it's a controversial topic, which garnered the attention it did. A day later and I'm still getting replies after all, and most of my comments are getting more and more downvotes and spam. "
