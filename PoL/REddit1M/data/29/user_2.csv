302,"~~Hmmm, I don't think so. There's always a series of town quests that pop up after the divine beast is complete. I don't think you can do the quest for the pants until you've finished vah ruta.~~ I may be wrong on this.

EDIT: The quest becomes available as soon as Muzu tells you about the Shock Arrows"
595,Actually I just discovered that the quest becomes available as soon as Muzu tells you about the Shock Arrows and it is possible to have all pieces before Vah Ruta. So good luck!
