31720,Does every Lynel in the game become silver after you beat Ganon? Because I haven't seen any red or blue ones since (except the one at the top of Zora's Domain)
108432,"I only killed 4 Lynels before beating Ganon though. The red one at Zora's Domain twice, a blue one in Akkala, and another blue one in Hyrule Castle. "
