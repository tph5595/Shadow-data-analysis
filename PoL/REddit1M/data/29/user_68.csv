20235,"I suspect that I'm missing something, but can the Sheikah Sensor be set to go off when you are near Captured Memory locations?  I get how to do it with pictures you snap (take picture of thing, it's tagged, set Sheikah Sensor to go off when near thing).  But I'm not sure if it can be used to help locate the memory spots.  

I don't want to use a spoiler map and just go A to B and was hoping this was an option to set (but I can't find it despite all my experimentation)."
