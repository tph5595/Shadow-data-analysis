I'm completing them just for the sake of completion, but tbh its pretty boring. They should have given more love to the sidequests, since the Beasts &amp; the story itself is quite short. "
16162,"I agree. I'm not saying that every side quest should be long &amp; elaborate, but having 90% of them being fetch quests is not okay. Even some of the shrine quests were fetch quests.

To comment OP: I recommend buying the some armor in Kakariko that helps with your stealth. "

39933,"My best horse is a 4/4/5, I found her in the same herd/area where you find the giant horse. 

She's solid brown with a white stripe on her face. I gave her a mohawk. :)

One of the loading screen tips say that horses that are a solid colour always have better stats than one with spots or patterns. I don't like that mechanic, personally...I want to ride around on a pretty painted horse without feeling like my horse is vastly inferior to other horses. :(

40102,Good luck with that. Nintendo isn't going to port any of their IPs to PC...the Zelda series is a major console seller.
