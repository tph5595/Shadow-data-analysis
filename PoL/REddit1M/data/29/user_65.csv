I remember fighting him and getting my ass handed to me as well. Don't listen to all these ""sneak past him"" people. It'll feel a lot more satisfying when you beat him.

You wanna stock up on TONS of health food to bring, then make a few defense and offense meals, start with all defense until you get his health down enough to change it up.

It's all about learning his attacks, and timing, and quite a lot of dying lol. You can shoot him in the face while he's charging to stun him. While he's stunned get some extra hits in or if you're quick enough you can mount him and hit him while he's bucking. If you've upgraded stasis twice then use that as much as possible, but if not then no big deal. 

When he's about to shoot fire try and run towards him, if you can hit him before he starts then he'll get stunned, if not just circle his blasts while closing the distance so you can hit him afterwards. 

Riding his wind currents after he shoots fire can be somewhat helpful, just don't stay up too long or he'll bring out his bow, always avoid him bringing out the bow.

Just go for the arrows to the face to stun his charges. When he's close get ready for lots of back flips, get those prefect dodges going, sometimes you can get those back to back when he does his close swings. 

Just git gud man, you can do it, dying happens a lot. But his weapon drops and monster parts are worth it :) "
