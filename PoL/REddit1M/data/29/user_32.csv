10916,"How many tiers are there of effects and resistances?

The resistances, I thought for sure there were only two (before you are immune).

For effects (defense, speed, attack etc) are there three tiers or two as well? I've seen mention of ""level 3 speed effects"" in a thread?"
11010,How long do you think that bow lasts as compared to a standard bow? 5 times longer... 10?
11117,Can't argue with that.
