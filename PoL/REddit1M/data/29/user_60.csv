15588,"Opal and Amber are used very sparingly with stuff you can get. If you sell all them and find a use for it later, you can easily find ways to get the 20-30 you'll need to get those items (which are not really needed anyways). Just imagine each as a ~50 rupee bonus.

Sell all Luminous stones but about 60, if you're looking to get all armor sets.

After completing one quest, you can trade 10 for one diamond, which is a good trade. Diamonds are good for late game weapons, but weapons that drop from late game enemies are better than those. Any rubies and sapphires you collect above 12 can be sold with no regrets.

This all applies for everything up to the mid to late game. For more uses in the late, late game, you can check this very much spoiler free Item Stocking list:

If only the screen is broken, you can solve them without the screen. The screen does nothing but display a fading ""touch here to play on the screen only"" message. If the whole controller is broken, I'm not sure."

None of them are exceptionally difficult, if you have food prepared.

For specific directions, you can talk to Impa."
