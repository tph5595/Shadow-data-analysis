12867,"Playing on The Wii U. I have a busted Wii U gamepad and am using the Pro Controller. Am I in a situation where there are unbeatable shrines? I have no intention of replacing or repairing my gamepad, and am not looking to get a switch any time soon. Are there any workarounds at all for motion based puzzles?"
