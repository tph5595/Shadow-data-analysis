10944,"I think I'm only missing the stone talus located inside Hyrule castle but I can't find it :\ can you guide me?

(preferably with the shrine inside of the castle as starting point)"
13495,Thanks! I found it :D 39/40 though :\ gonna have to check the guide and go to all the other locations until I find one without a star..
14561,"Yeah :\ should have done that from the beggining but, since I was missing 10-15 of each I thought it'd be easy to keep track.. nope

Gona use the skulls to mark all their locations though instead of using the 5 colored marks each time like I've been doing."
35308,I had to check more than half of them but I finally found it :D
44047,"Yes, here's where/how:

Accesing thourgh the docks (on the north iirc), after going up the first set of stairs, you'll see torches and a pile of wood in a bowl. Light up that wood and the shrine will reveal itself."
