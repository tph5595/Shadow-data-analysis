42438,I bought the monster saddle and bridle from kilton. What horse do I put that in and how do I do it? I took it to the girl at outskirt stable and she says she has nothing big enough to put on him. But I do. 
88574,Oohh.. I figured it would work on the BIG horse. The description on the bridle and saddle mention it must have been made for a monsterous horse.
