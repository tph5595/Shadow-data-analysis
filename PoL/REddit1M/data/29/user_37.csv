11757,"It's in the caves underneath, with a bunch of ice in it, iirc. Go out of the entrance of the river, past the prison and the entrance should be somewhere close to the water, somewhere on the north-west side of the castle."
12443,"To add to the others, I like to use Stasis on them. It gets in a full sword combo even on silver ones and they get stunned even if you only hit them once in Stasis. Good when they do an attack you are not used to dodge and you get some additional hits in before they recover. 

And high level ones can do a roar attack, followed by an explosion. If you stand close to them, you won't get hit. Just don't stand close to the sword when they ram it into the ground, before the explosion. I usually stand between the front- and hind legs. I'm not sure if attacking it will make link take a step back, into the explosion, though, I usually stand still and attack in the short recovery phase."
12901,"If you want to find a full list of quests, google will help, it did for me anyway. But as the others said, most are pretty useless, apart for 100% completion.

As for quests with good rewards, doing most quests, including some shrine quests in the Gerudo town will give you a unique reward.

In the south, in Lakeside stable a young lady will give you a quest which rewards you with an armor piece. It's pretty easy as well."
13844,"I just used a skull symbol anytime I killed one of the bosses when I farmed the Taluses and Hinox, exactly because of this. Though it's probably too late for you :/ Keep it up, at least you will be rich by the end of it. :D"
14226,"Without a gyroscope, some shrines might be impossible, at least in the ""intended"" way. With some imagination, you might find workarounds, but I wouldn't get my hopes up. I have the switch version, so I might be wrong and there might be a way of doing it on the pro controller, but I would't bet on it."
14487,"It's the shrine in the akkala region, the big spiral on the coast. The quest triggers by examining a stone tablet somewhere around where you found the orb."
33925,"The general stats depend on their color, single color horses are generally better than those with a different colored backside. (Somebody ingame confirms this, I also think the single colored always have a wild personality)

I also think it depends on where you catch them. The ones close to the twin peaks are generally worse than the ones found in ""late game"" areas. I found one in the north of Ridgeland Tower with 5 Stamina, 4 Speed, and 5 Strength (might be 4, I don't remember, but I think it was 5). I don't think there are ""perfect"" horses, though."
34171,"There's a guaranteed blue spawning inside the 1st gateway tower (it was called something like this anyway) inside Hyrule Castle. Other than that, I also haven't seen any non-silvers, apart from the Zora one."
