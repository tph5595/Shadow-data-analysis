2634,I did this today...I think they do regrow but overtime as when I returned there was one back on the tree
70436,"I am having difficulty finding a Korok seed. According to the guide, there is a seed above or very near to the Hyrule Town Ruins Gate. I found one that does a race (to the main fountain) to the left and on my right an archery challenge near a ruined Guardian. Does anyone know where this 3rd seed is?"
73363,They probably will but in time. When they opened Zelda pre-orders they had some restocked. I would have a guess when the DLC for Zelda arrives they will restock
73604,Ah that might be it. Do you recall what sort of challenge it is?
75315,"I'll have a look at the rock later. Thanks anyway :)

Getting close to the end now. 810+ Seeds :)"
