15689,"There are three factors to consider, the pre-dungeon entry section, the dungeon/boss section, and the reward for beating it.

In my opinion, the easiest to hardest ranking for the entry sections is this:

Very Easy: Rito -- 

Easy: Gerudo -- 

Medium: Zora -- 

Hard: Goron

***

Ranking the dungeons and bosses easy to hard:

Very easy: Zora -- 

Easy: Rito -- 

Medium: Goron -- 

Hard: Gerudo

***

Ranking the usefulness of their items from most to least useful (though all are really useful!):

Most useful: Rito -- 

Very useful: Zora -- 

Occasionally needed: Gerudo -- 

rarely needed: Goron

***

That's just my opinions, of course. Nothing that's labeled as ""hard"" is really that hard, though the Gerudo one did give me a few headaches trying to figure it out, and the boss is challenging because the mechanics needed to beat him are a little clunky. Nothing is too crazy though.

Based on that I'd say hit the Rito first, then Zora, then Goron, then Gerudo"
16198,"I'll mirror what everyone else is saying. I used to run in terror from them but finally got the gumption to try. First things first: upgrade your slate to Stasis+ so you can freeze enemies. Also stock up on bomb arrows.

The trick is to stun them with an arrow to the forehead. Technically you don't need bomb arrows to stun them, but that gets you more damage. If you hit them at close range though you'll lose some hearts.

I start the fight by freezing him with stasis, and then I hit him with a bomb arrow as I approach. I'll get in a few sword swings with my best sword and then stasis will break.

The Lynel, upon taking so much damage will retreat and prepare to charge you. Hit him with another arrow to stun him again (you won't have time to wait for stasis to recharge). Then run up and mount him and spam the Y button. Once he kicks you off you'll land on your feet. Hit ZL to target him again, get another arrow to his head as he charges, rinse and repeat.

Depending on the variety, he may shoot fireballs at you, so just run in a circle with him ZL-targeted and after the third one, bean him with an arrow, mount him and wail on him.

That's my method. I don't bother with fury rush and so on because I can't get it perfect and don't want to take too much damage. A few meat skewers (15 hearts) and Mipha's Grace are enough to make him dead within a couple minutes."

This is a lifesaver, imo.

ZL targeting keeps the gyro close to his head, so you only need to make minor adjustments to nail him in the forehead.

Without ZL targeting you're moving the reticle all over the place, and the Lynel is usually too fast to get a good shot in."
41406,"Yes but the trick is to hit A the moment you hear the beep.

It charges and charges, then BEEP and laser blast. Hit A right as you hear the beep and it'll go right back at them.

It's going to feel like you're a split second early but you'll actually be right on time"
