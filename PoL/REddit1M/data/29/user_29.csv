10729,"Ancient bow from Akkala tech lab is my current bow of choice. Costs 1,000 rupees plus some ancient springs and screws and a giant core. Totally worth it. Otherwise I like finding the Lizal bows with like 36 power. "
11734,I just got it yesterday so I'm not sure. I read in a thread here yesterday it lasts over 100 arrows of use
11794,So I unlocked the whole map and completed my 40th shrine yesterday. Haven't dealt with any of the 4 beasts yet. Which one should I go for first?
11891,"You can always save up by selling extra meals or play that bowling game to farm rupees. I haven't done the bowling thing yet but I'm consistently around 3,000 rupees just by selling extra meals, monster fangs and stuff like that, and amber/luminous stones etc. "
12114,Sorry to highjack but where exactly is Hyrule castle? I have the whole map unlocked but I'm not sure... are we just talking about Ganon's castle in the middle of the map? I'm afraid to go there and trigger anything endgame related 
12443,Thanks I guess I'll do the same. Which region would that be?
12505,I'll probably do the same but I do want to check out Gerudo town to use some amber and opal and all that for earrings (?i think?) 
23445,Good point... is the ancient armor really that good? Or just protects against guardians? (Which don't scare me now that I have ancient arrows and decent parrying skill)
43553,"I see, so it's better to sell off those items for rupees you think?"
43624,Good point haha I did Rito anyways
