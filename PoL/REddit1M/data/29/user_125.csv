71070,"1. Stasis+. It's a short time, but it can help stall them if they're about to shoot.

2. Regular arrows. Shoot them in the eye and it paralyses them.

3. Take out their legs. This also paralyses them.

4. Guardian Weapons (sword, axe, spear). These take out their legs in ONE HIT. Go farm them in Tests of Strength shrines, or other shrines you know of with the little ones.

5. Perfect parry. Even a pot lid is unbreakable if you do a perfect parry on their beams. Takes 3 direct hits.

A good strategy is to run up and shoot it in the eye with an arrow. Whack it's body a few times, and then take out a leg. Hit the body a few times, take out a leg. Rinse repeat. Sometimes they'll crawl away quicker than you can get to one of the legs, so that's where arrows and statis+ come in handy.

If you're good a parrying then I think it's the quickest and most efficient."
