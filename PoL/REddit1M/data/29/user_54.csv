14725,Just got to the place where I need shock arrows from a Lynel above Zora's Domain. This monster kicked my ass 5 times over and it's the first monster to do so. Am I missing something in fighting him or can I just not do this quest yet?
20729,Oooohhhhhhhh. Thanks. Hadn't thought of that. What a clever trick.
