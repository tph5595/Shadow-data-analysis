9175,"Here's what I do:

* Wait for a moment you can get close enough to do a Charged Attack with Urbosa's Fury

* Using the Fury will hurt and stun them

* Wail on them while they are stunned

* As they begin to get up, charge up Urbosa's Fury again

* Repeat until dead

It's so far the easiest method I have of taking down those harder enemies. It may take longer between them to recharge the power, but at least they'll be dead and you'll be alive."

Second off that's a known bug where you have too many Blood Moons in a small window of time."
9655,"Yeah, but they buck you off after like, four seconds.

I find cheesing it with Urbosa's Fury is the best way to do it.

Or if you like using the bow, lots of face shots."
9668,"If you want to try a bow, shooting them in the face also stuns them."
10296,"Well, after you defeat one lynel, take its bow. The three shots helps.

I make sure to ZL Target and then get a finer aim with the gyo controls. The three arrows at once helps me be sure my aim wasn't too off as one of them will hit."
