61023,"Use a shield to bounce back the shots. Target the guardian and there's like a second right before the guardian shoots where it turns blue. Hit A during this second and you'll reflect the beam at it. Do this 2-3 times and you'll have killed it. You can use any shield for this, and I'd say use a crappy one, because if you miss the timing, the beam will destroy your shield. Also, might be worth it to invest in the guardian clothing, since it greatly reduces the damage when you miss."
