17961,"No, no need to buy the jewelry. The jewelry resists seem identical to the equivalent head armor, but it breaks the set bonus, so there's no game play reason to wear jewelry, while there's definitely a game play reason for wearing all 3 pieces of appropriate armor.

The jewelry exists mainly for aesthetics, for armor sets with helmets/hoods, so you can see Link's face/hair while playing, instead of seeing a helmet/hood all the time."

It's the best way to start the fight, by sneaking/gliding up, mounting, and bashing him until he bucks you off. Then knock him down and do it again. I make it sound easy, but knocking him down is tough (I'm sure some people can do the arrow in the eye thing on demand, but I'm not one of them)."

The prime meat can be hunted via the repeatable deer hunting mini game in Hateno village.

There's zero use for either prime meat or gourmet meat, other than rupees. If you want heart food, use other meats instead, as prime/gourmet meat is more valuable cooked &amp; sold."
20256,"I know you want the Stealth armor right now, but it's faster to tame a horse, ride into Hateno, galloping past all the monsters, and play the deer hunting mini game there for the rupees you need to buy the Stealth armor back in Kakariko.

Edit: never mind, I saw a later comment, and realized you're selling amiibo drops for rupees."
21316,"Nah, if I had amiibos, I'd sell everything they drop that's not a diamond, sapphire, ruby, or topaz. I'd even cook all the food drops, 5 at a time, and sell those too.

If you have enough amiibos that you can buy the Stealth armor right away from drops, do it and replenish your supply tomorrow or the next day."
32046,"Levels needed to reach max effect:

* Cold / Heat = 2 levels
* Stealth / Climbing / Flame / Guardian / Attack / Swim = 3 levels

Set bonuses are different than resistances or effects, in that you can reach maximum effect without a set bonus, if you wear mismatched items, or eat special food while wearing a partial set. Note that nearly all the immunities are set bonuses.

A really common (at least for me) purposeful set break is to wear your snow boots or sand boots. Sure you lose your set bonus, but you run faster, so it's worth most of the time, when you aren't facing a monster that does elemental damage."

It looks like certain attacks do a minimum amount of damage, no matter how much armor you wear, and max Hylian armor hits that threshold."
