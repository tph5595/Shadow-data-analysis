Incidentally - Riding (Day) incorporates a loose interpretation of Zelda's Lullaby. During the day your traveling song is Zelda's, and during the night it's Link's."

But, no, it's not constantly repeated like in Link to the Past or Majora's Mask. Instead it acts more as a leitmotif for Link, like Zelda's Lullaby does for Zelda."
88437,I thought the Master Sword doesn't take damage when it's used against Ganon and the Divine Beast bosses. Might be wrong though...
