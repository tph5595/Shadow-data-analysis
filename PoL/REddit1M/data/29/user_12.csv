5368,"Just last night I was climbing a tower. Game clock read about 6:30 in the morning and a blood moon suddenly and instantly occurred. I get to the top of the tower, and it's roughly 3 in the evening and boom, another blood moon. Am I affected by the blood moon bug a how could I fix it?

Edit: cocks can't tell time"
