53933,"So we have three timelines, three main characters (Zelda, Link, and Gannon), and the Triforce.

What if in each timeline, one of the Triforce were stronger or more potent than the other two for that timeline.  For example, in one timeline, the Trigorce of power had more influence over the timeline than the other two.  In another timeline, the Triforce of courage was the most influential.

At the end of each timeline, one of the three main recurring characters survives, while the other two die off.  In the timeline that is influenced most by the Triforce of Power, Ganon ends up the only remaining main character, with the lines of Links and Zeldas coming to an end completely.  In the Courage timeline, Link is the last one alive, Zelda's bloodline dies out, and Gabon is destroyed forever.  In the Wisdom timeline, only Zelda survives.

The end of each timeline leaves the realms that they contain out of balance.  Courage and power are no longer tempered by Wisdom, etc.  Because of this, the realms collide.  They collapse upon themselves in a kind of apocalyptic chaos.  This creates a new Hyrule, with elements of all three timelines.  This new Hyrule contains Link, Zelda, and Ganon once again and the Triforce are now balanced in power/influence equally.  The peoples of each timeline are now intermingled together in a single realm, and share their respective histories.  They rebuild Hyrule together, move forward in a unified timeline, and the saga continues.

It's a stretch, for sure, but I think it could be a workable idea."
