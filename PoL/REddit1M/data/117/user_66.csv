56021,"This shouldn't be too bad of a rude awakening. They only issued an official time line at the insistence of fans, and not because the original Zelda for NES was ever supposed to be connected to Wind Waker. Nintendo makes up the stories that best fit their vision for the current game, and then move on. Sometimes this results in direct sequels (Majora's Mask, Phantom Hourglass), sometimes in indirect sequels (Wind Waker), and sometimes in works with no real connection to other previous Zeldas (Twilight Princess or Ocarina of Time). The official timeline was also convenient marketing for the at-the-time new release of Skyward Sword, which is the ""first"" game and about the creation of Hyrule and the Master Sword. Though I do appreciate that the statues of Hylia in BotW look the same as in Skyward Sword. But it's weird to talk of Hylia at all when the creation myth presented in Ocarina makes no mention of her. And that's because she was invented for the purposes of Skyward Sword.

Really, Zelda has mostly been a repeated retelling of the same story. Nintendo will make changes where necessary for the purposes of the next game. And there's nothing wrong with that. There's even great value with veering significantly from canon, eg Majora's Mask, which is still one of the most unique game concepts, even after 17 years. And there's not a Ganon or Kakariko or Master Sword to be found in it. Sure, it can be confusing when you find explicit references to Ocarina in BotW, but those are just pleasant easter eggs for nostalgia's sake. If we honestly try to bridge the two games, we'll be reduced to unnecessary nitpicking, like ""how did Kakariko end up so far away from Death Mountain?"" It doesn't actually matter, just enjoy the great game!"
