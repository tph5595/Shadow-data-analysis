39765,"I've always interpreted the LoZ series exactly like ancient myths of our world. This was my stance before Hyrule Historia and I've been pretty stubborn on it even with an ""official timeline"" existing.

**They're different stories created by different people over the ages with a loose connection of characters, icons, and themes.** Sometimes they **do** appear sequential, and sometimes they don't line up well *at all*. It's precisely like if you tried to put in order every story about Zeus and the Greek Pantheon or Odin and others from Norse mythology. You couldn't, really. You have a clear starting point, and then a mess of things in the middle that have a very vague sense of order, and then if you're lucky you have an end point (Norse mythos has Ragnarok which marks a very clear end time for the age of the gods, similar to how BotW is easy to identify as the last entry in the LoZ so far).

These are stories passed down through generations and the ages. They were told as bed time stories or at a campfire. They were meticulously recorded by historians and checked for accuracy.

This also helps rationalize why certain visual elements of the games are only *somewhat* consistent, and the various discrepancies with the topography. Take Gohma for example. Gohma is always a large on-eyed arthropod... but it frequently looks completely different while still fitting into that simple description that you'd likely see in a myth. Gohma is seen as a large eye with insect legs in older 2d games, then an eye with pincers in Oracles, then a strange bipedal insect in OoT, then more of a long centipede type monster in WW, then a giant spider with an eye on it's back in TP (named Armo**gohma**). Bokoblins and Moblins frequently look completely different but retain their core identity. **Ganon(dorf) himself** is both consistent and inconsistent. Ganon is always a porcine beast, and Ganondorf is always a male Gerudo, but despite always being the incarnation of evil and arguably the same being over the ages, his personality is always different enough that it's often hard to consider then the same person (arguably enough time takes place between games that a person could undergo these changes, though).

Even if no one wants to agree with that theory, the game themselves present enough evidence that the timeline shouldn't be viewed as a strict flow of events like real history. It simply can't be. WW and BotW can't coexist in the same timeline for example. BotW can't be after WW because the Zora don't exist anymore in WW and even if they did the Great Sea is devoid of fish (excepting the strange sapient fishman). If the Great Sea were to even drain away then where did the Zora come back from? Likewise WW can't be after BotW because Ganon has foregone the cycle of reincarnation and exists as a supernatural incarnation of malice. Ganondorf in WW is clearly still a lucid Gerudo male. However they're the only two games with Rito in them. One was obviously told first and then someone heard it and told his own *better* story (or else the Rito simply do exist in whatever present time these legends come from but no one knows when they actually appeared). Then of course you have things like Minish Cap which doesn't even appear to take place in the common interpretation of Hyrule, and LttP and aLBW in which **many races like the Goron, Gerudo, and Kokiri/Korok don't even exist at all.**"
