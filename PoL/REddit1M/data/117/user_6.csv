3484,"While I firmly believe BOTW takes place in the downfall timeline after AoL, I'm also beginning to think this will be the last game in the whole timeline. SS was the first, kinda makes sense to have BOTW being last since they were released back to back on consoles. Also having SS and BOTW being at the start and end of the timeline makes it easier to fit in future games between them. 

I'm honestly starting to get the feeling that the 3 timelines will all converge at some point and BOTW is the last chapter leaving Hyrule to be happily ever after. For some reason I just got the feeling that Demise/Ganon has been purged from the world for good and the ""true ending"" actually does feel like the world is at peace. 

Granted whatever they have in store for the DLC will probably prove this wrong. "
7077,"Have they ever confirmed WHEN the hero is defeated? Does he die against Ganon? Does he die before pulling the master sword? Does he die falling out of his treehouse at the start of OoT? The sages from OoT could all have awaken, like the adult timeline, depending on WHEN the hero dies. "
7839,"Also the towns in AoL being named after the OoT sages kinda confirms that. Even the trial and ""execution"" scene from TP (child timeline) confirms sages were awaken in that timeline. 

I guess one of the few things that happens in all 3 timelines is the awakening of the sages. "
