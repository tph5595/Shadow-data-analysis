256,"He's a bit vague there, but the impression I get is that he's considering abandoning the idea of the triple timeline split, but also waiting to see how fans interpret things. "
1288,"I agree, but probably not yet. I think it won't be until we get a more story-oriented game, rather than BotW's ""throw continuity to the wind and just have fun"" style."
3986,"There's no meaning to the claim that timelines ""converge"". They can take place in series or in parallel, but one future can't have two pasts."
4836,"Same thing as splitting the timeline, really. WW and TP are (last we heard) mutually exclusive canon. "
5760,"Maybe TES made that mistake, but I'd rather they just declare that there is no Zelda timeline than give a copout that boils down to ""the goddesses rewrote history to contradict itself for no reason""."
12556,"I think that if TP and WW take place in the same timeline, then TP *has* to be first. It's a direct sequel to OoT in a way that WW isn't."
12692,"Some games (TP, SS) embrace continuity. Others (WW, BotW) ignore it and let things work out later."
15760,"That makes a lot more sense, yeah. I can definitely buy that BotW is so far in the future that the different timelines don't even make a difference anymore."
24092,The point is that the previously-known timelines are no longer considered accurate. (Which has happened many times before.)
24440,"&gt;Fujibayashi and Aonuma also took on a question regarding where Breath of the Wildâ€™s story is positioned in the history of Hyrule

&gt;there are some occasions of canon histories becoming slightly changed."
36895,"Yeah, that idea is actually perfectly fine and even seems plausible for BotW."
38221,"Ganon is already in all three timelines, and there's no reason we wouldn't expect him to be. Ganondorf is the same person whose powers come from the same source in all three."
38434,Personally I think it would have been more elegant if they had made the LttP timeline stem from the timeline Link goes back in time from in Majora's Mask. Where Link never returns from the woods and is presumed dead.
123067,"OoT was a huge retcon to LttP at the time it came out, before they decided to call it an alternate timeline years later. And just recently they changed their mind about whether the Oracles had their own Link or not. Continuity has always been a tentative thing in this series."
