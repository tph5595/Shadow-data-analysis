1323,"Any time aounuma says something along the the lines as ""leaving it up to the interpretation of the player"" it just further cements my belief that the Zelda timeline has gone so far off the rails over the course of the series that even the creators can't keep up with all the inconsistencies and convoluted details. They have tried to clear things up with their hyrule history book but it all still seems like a mess. I don't even care which game falls where in the timeline I think the best way to play the series is in release order if someone chooses to play them all back to back.  "
17225,100% agree with your comment.  The real charm to Zelda is the gameplay and the iconography of the setting the games are set in.  Try to dig any deeper for any nuances  in the story and you might find a few call backs to other games but a whole lot of headache trying to find a perfect placement for them in a timeline. To me that just seems pointless and doesn't fucking matter at this point.
