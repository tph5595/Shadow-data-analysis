37745,"Abandoning the split timeline, but still using aspects from each split, is an unsatisfying answer and an unsatisfying way to do things. It makes no sense in plenty of established ways. Ganon never exists until OOT's adult timeline, for example. The hero's shade never exists until child link in OOT goes off on his own. Those two things cannot coexist in one timeline. But apparently now they ""just do"" which...ugh. Not a fan."
