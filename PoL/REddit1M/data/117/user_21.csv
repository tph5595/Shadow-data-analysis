It came as a major surprise when it first got revealed, and I think that where people think that ""Link is defeated"" being a possibility in each game makes the timeline messy, I think it opens up tons of new possibilities and encourages people to continue theorizing every time a game comes out.

Retconning, however, I have always had an intense hatred for. Why bother theorizing about timeline placement when pre-established facts are subject to change or removal? Aonuma said that history books change, but that is very different. It is reworking what we know to move closer towards a single, unchanging truth. We want to know what happened, and how it happened. However, when you're dealing with a work of fiction that is subject to retconning, there is no single, unchanging truth. They can change what that truth is, and that makes theorizing about timelines totally pointless."
