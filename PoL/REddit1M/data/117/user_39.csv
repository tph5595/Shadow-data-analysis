22868,The fact that they basically made players using console commands and mods part of the canon through CHIM is just my favourite thing about ES lore.

Basically CHIM is a kind of Nirvana that allows one to completely alter the makeup of the universe. It's implied through a bunch of the texts that player characters using console commands and/or mods have reached CHIM. 

The wiki description 'Once CHIM is achieved, people experience a state in which time is bent both inward and outward into a ""a shape that is always new"" as well as an incomprehensible sense of the Godhead. One who achieves CHIM is able to observe the Tower without fear and reside within it' sounds awfully like the *loading a save, quitting, loading a save* cycle that testing mods out creates, with the final state being a stable game."
