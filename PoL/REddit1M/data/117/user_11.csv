4790,"All the ambiguous timeline stuff with this game is weird to me, because it wouldn't be that difficult at all for the devs to figure out how to solidly place a game at a specific point in the timeline. There are huge spans of time, in all timelines, where we have basically no information as to what was happening at that time and they could do anything story-wise, including introduce a new hero. I guess you could take that to mean it doesn't matter where a game falls on the timeline, so we should stop worrying about it, as it certainly seems like the developers have. But then why did they go to the trouble of spelling it out in the Hyrule Historia? Why didn't they just say there's no chronology and it's not always the same universe?"
