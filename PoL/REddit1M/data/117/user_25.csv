70041,"I was referring specifically to the Law of Excluded Middle, which states that for any proposition either that proposition is true or it is false.  On a proposed convergence timeline it would be both true and false that the Hero of Time defeated Ganondorf.  This proposition is blatantly absurd, akin to asserting that married bachelors exist in the convergence timeline, and thus renders the entire Zelda universe an exercise in absurdity, effectively shooting suspension of disbelief in the face.

To give some philisophical context, there is a growing use of possible worlds talk in philosophical communities.  Possible worlds need not be considered as concrete entities *ala* a multiverse, but rather as a maximally consistent collection of true propositions.  In no possible world is it true that a married bachelor exists, for this hypothetical object is impossible and no state of affairs could render it actual.

Thus, the proposed convergence timeline does not even fall within the realm of possibility and its necessary entailments would run counter to the very foundation of reason that should be shared between the actual world and those of fiction.

70203,But logic though
70739,"On a serious note, I understand what you're saying but immersion within a setting can be a very real factor when it comes to enjoyment of that setting.  I myself find it difficult to enjoy a setting where there is little actual thought put into the world-building and how its fantastical elements interplay with its mundane.  I originally came to love Zelda during the Wind Waker days where, prior to the change in management that came after Twilight Princess, more emphasis seemed to have been placed on background lore and environmental story-telling.  The relative de-emphasis on this come Breath of the Wild certainly played a role in   how much ""fun"" I had with the game, so questions like this one can matter for those weird people like me who really like story in video games.  I know that Breath of the Wild was attempting to return to Zelda's less story-focused roots, but in my modest opinion the story of later titles was a flat out improvement over the earlier."
