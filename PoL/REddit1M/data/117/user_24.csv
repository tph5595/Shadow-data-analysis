11541,"SPOILERS KINDA, not a big one. 

Zelda herself references 3 heroes when blessing link in a flashback, a ritual to divine his worthiness to wield the master sword. 
She says hero of heavens, hero of time, and the hero of twilight. 
Child timeline. But meaningless, because the game itself pulls elements from all past zeldas. 
I think the dragonbreak is real, and that its so far into the future that all possibilities have simply become legends and all significance of those events with exception to oot are null and void. And i prefer it that way. The timeline was a wound in the lore of the world that needed to be fixed so history could move on."
