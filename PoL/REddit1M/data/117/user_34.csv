16833,"I was discussing this with others in another thread. I initially thought the child timeline as well, and I don't think this technically rules anything out, but supposedly there's a monument in the Zora area of BotW where Ruto is referred to as a sage.

And whether any of the sages were awakened or if *other* people acted as the sages in Twilight Princess is really, really vague and hard to tell. If Ruto didn't become a sage in child timeline though, then this might not be child timeline.

My current theory is that the Zeldas know about the other timelines and legends."
