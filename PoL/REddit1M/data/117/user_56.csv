38107,"What I get is that the history in-universe is changed, due to the 10,000 year gap. We already know this, though, since the Triforce is only known as a Sealing Power now, and Ganon's origins is a fairytale. "
38565,"&gt; Look at the state of this stuff over time. LoZ and Zelda 2 are consistent... and then LttP comes out and it makes no god damn sense relative to either. LA could be anywhere, whatever. Then OoT comes out and it's a prequel to events talked in LttP... sure. LoZ and LttP still don't really make sense together, but sure. MM is another side story, we're doing good... then WW hits and makes no god damn sense relative to LoZ or LttP. Oh and look at Twilight Princess making no god damn sense relative to LoZ or LttP or WE.

wtf are you even on about here? Why do TWW and TP have to make sense relative to games that are on completely different timelines in the first place?

If you take time to actually notice and do some research, the timeline in HH stays consistent with developer quotes and in-game evidence. FS was the first story until MC came out, and that was the first story until SS came out, which stays consistent with the SS &gt; MC &gt; FS order we have right now. OoT was always after SS and MC, as that wasn't an origin story ever. TWW was always several hundred years after OoT, and PH and ST were sequels. That stays consistent with the OoT &gt; TWW &gt; PH &gt; ST order. MM was a sequel to OoT, and TP was always the aftermath of Link going back in time at the end of OoT. FSA was always after FS, and technically it still is. That stays consistent with the OoT &gt; MM &gt; TP &gt; FSA order. OoT was always a prequel to ALttP, which was always a prequel to LoZ. AoL was a sequel to LoZ. LA was always after OoT, but since OoT was a prequel to ALttP, it's only logical that LA comes after ALttP. That stays consistent with the OoT &gt; ALttP &gt; LA &gt; LoZ &gt; AoL order (I didn't include OoX since that... kinda doesn't matter much?). Put it together, you get the timeline in HH. 

Claiming Aonuma never cared about the timeline is utter BS, since they pretty clearly had it in mind way before HH came out. I'm honestly seriously tired of this ""timeline don exits"" or ""the devs don caer"" shit that's been tossed around recently. Here's an idea: *maybe actually do some research because it's really not all that complicated as you all make it out to be.*"
38662,"&gt;Aonuma dropping tons of hints about a timeline placement

&gt;game itself points to a pretty obvious placement

&gt;""nah, he doesn't give a fuck about timeline placement lol"""
43589,"&gt;Here's something to add to your research. Didn't they also move the games around in the newest art book? These guys are really consistent.

Miyamoto is also notorious for not caring about story in *any* game, let alone the Zelda series. That's why most people look to Aonuma's quotes on the timeline. But thanks for that, that confirms that they at least have been thinking about a timeline since '98.

Hyrule Encyclopedia was also not made by the developers, and the authors even admitted that they took liberties on the lore. Thus, it's pretty much as canon as the manga.

&gt;I've played all of them, in order, multiple times, over a span of nearly thirty years now. And never once did I see any compelling evidence for alternate realities.

OoT pretty clearly has two endings. The credits sequence showed what happened after Link and Zelda sealed Ganondorf. The scene after the credits showed what happened to Link when he was sent back in time. [Then after TP was released, Aonuma confirmed in an interview that it takes place parallel to TWW.](https://zeldauniverse.net/2007/03/07/the-split-timeline-serious-business/) From there, games were either made following this order.

The only alternate reality that you can argue is BS is the Downfall Timeline, where Link dies at the end of OoT. 

&gt;a thing that no game makes any effort to even hint at.

Sure, let's just ignore TWW and TP's backstory, SS's references to OoT, ALBW's references to ALttP, all of the sequels, etc. etc.

&gt;an obsession over minutiae that isn't anywhere near what makes these games interesting, either as games, or as landmarks within gaming and pop culture in general.

This is the one argument that pisses me off the most when it comes to ""there's no timeline/timeline is BS"", because it mocks how other players have fun with the series. They're basically saying ""You're enjoying the series differently, don't do that. Enjoy it the way I enjoy it."" That's stupid. Why is it an obsession? Because we happen to pay a bit more attention to the story? Because we care about the lore of a series we love? How is it an obsession if all this timeline stuff is handed to us anyway? If the games weren't meant to connect, nobody would be trying to connect them in the first place, just like the Mario series. But we do try to connect them because it's pretty clear they're meant to. "

And when I see BS, I'll call it out, especially when said BS involves calling an entire part of the fanbase ""obsessive"" for having differing opinions. You don't need to like the timeline, but don't try to make others feel bad about liking it."

As I said before, this is what my problem is. Which is almost always the conclusion to ""timeline wasn't planned""."
