15639,"The timelines could converge in the sense that BotW is an inevitability that will happen in the distant future of all 3 timelines.  The timelines wouldn't merge in the sense that there are still 3 parallel realities (and you would need a plausible explanation for BotW happening in all 3 timelines), but all 3 realities would basically contain the same events from BotW onward.  So from this point forward there would be no need to distinguish which timeline events are occurring in.  

This concept is actually used in a fair amount of sci-fi stories, where characters change the past but the universe eventually finds a way to steer itself back onto the predestined path.  In the relam of Nintendo games, Fire Emblem Awakening toyed with this idea.  [Lucina travels back in time and saves Emmeryn from assassination, but Emmeryn ends up getting killed not long after anyway, leading to a nearly identical series of subsequent events](/spoiler)"
