41392,"&gt; I mean, they clearly never cared. They've always been more interested in leaning on consistent iconography and tropes over developing some kind of overarching consistency.

The second Zelda game was a sequel to the first... The third was stated, in the manual, to be a prequel. Ocarina of Time was set in AlttP's backstory, this was clear from the beginning. Majora's Mask was a direct OoT sequel, wind waker's intro is literally ocarina of time's ending, etc etc. Even in interviews as far back as summer 2002, months before Wind Waker released we have aonuma and miyamoto on record talking about a split timeline after the adult and child endings of ocarina of time in gamepro magazine"

41547,"&gt; ven the trial and ""execution"" scene from TP (child timeline) confirms sages were awaken in that timeline.

No, they were the ""ancient"" sages, the new sages would never had have to been awakened because they're executing ganondorf, he never broke in to the sacred realm and killed them all in the first place in the child timeline"
41958,"Because that literally makes no sense.

1. Timelines don't just converge, what happens, does TP Hyrule flood? does Tingle meet himself? are there now 3 Twilight realms? Malladus, Ganon, and Ganondorf chillin' and having some coffee?

2. It backs the writers in to a corner that they don't need to back themselves in to, contrary to what some will have you believe they do take timeline in to account. Why have 3 distinct settings all turn in to one samey world? you're just limiting yourself in setting

3. There has been literally NOTHING in any of the games to suggest any kind of convergence has happened, will happen, or can happen"
42158,"We know that spinoffs are non canon, what people generally mean when they talk about the games that should have been non-canon are the Four Sword trio, and now TFH. Before the official timeline reveal, back when all we knew was that there was a split, and that zelda 2 was a sequel to 1, alttp was a prequel to that, oot one to that, mm a sequel to oot, ww after oot, etc, the minish cap, four sword, and four sword adventures messed things up (and continue to do so)"
42504,"Aonuma's talking about INGAME history books changing, like real world historical inaccuracy, he's saying to look at the bigger picture, the world itself for a timeline placement, and not to focus on the smaller details of the history that we're given because it's been over ten thousand years in universe

He's not saying ""come up with your own canon"", he's saying look closer at the game and figure out what it's hinting at"
42751,"&gt; The point is that the previously-known timelines are no longer considered accurate.

That's not what he said at all? they're talking about the game world's history not being exactly what we know happened, like, the characters don't have an accurate view of the history that we've played because it's been such a long time that records ""history books"" are inaccurate (like the complete Triforce being a Ganon-specific ""sealing power"" and not a wishing relic)

&gt;there are some occasions of canon histories becoming slightly changed.

they're talking about this game's history not matching up with the history that we know"
90422,"Just talking about the Twilight doesn't mean it has anything to do with TP, the Twilight exists in all three timelines, as does Zant, sealing the interlopers in the Twilight happens BEFORE Ocarina of Time. Zelda's also not speking in the past tense, could all be in-universe hypothetical, but a reference to us. As could the seas of distance quote, because as we've seen, there are multiple seas"
97524,"You misunderstand, it was CLEARLY a reference for us, and that's the thing. it was a reference, they said it once, then never mentioned it again. things that we ARE meant to pay attention to are drilled in to us.

[Vah Ruta is Named After Ruto, she is mentioned as a Zora princess, and an ancient sage on the plaques leading up to Zora's Domain](/spoiler)

[Vah Naboris is named after Nabooru confirmed, Urbosa mentions her directly](/spoiler)

[Vah Medoh is a Medli reference but nobody at all mentions Medli or speaks about her because it's meant to be a reference and not a timeline hint.](/spoiler)

They didn't mention Zant, or the Twilight realm, just used the vague word ""twilight"", which doesn't tie the game to TP at all, she also mentioned ""seas of time or distance"", which is a reference to Wind Waker for us, without specifically talking about Hyrule being washed away, and the Great Sea"
