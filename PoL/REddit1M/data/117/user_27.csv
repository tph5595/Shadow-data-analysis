12780,"She actually doesn't mention the heroes in that speech. She's basically saying a prayer, asking that the Master Sword watch over Link regardless of whether he finds himself ""skwyard bound, adrift in time, or steeped in the embers of twilight"". Some people do take that as a literal reference to SS, OoT, and TP, but there's nothing specific enough there to say for sure. I mean, for all we know this could be entirely metaphorical with ""skyward bound"" being a metaphor for birth, ""adrift in time"" being a metaphor for life, and ""steeped in the embers of twilight"" being a metaphor for death, and Zelda is just asking that the sword watch over Link for the entirety of his life. That speech really didn't give us a lot to go on."
13006,"The timeline section of the book has always carried a paragraph at the very beginning saying that the HH timeline is subject to change, is just what the people of Hyrule currently believe to be true, and that readers are invited to discover the timeline for themselves. So if and when the HH timeline is changed, it will fit with what HH itself said was going to happen. (And we've already seen the timeline changed slightly in the brand new Hyrule Encyclopedia that's recently been released in Japan anyway, though I know some people don't acknowledge any canonicity from it.)"
13169,"They have said that the CD-i games, BS Zelda, Link's Crossbow Training, Ancient Stone Tablets, the Tingle games, and Hyrule Warriors are non-canon. Granted, the timeline could be cleaner still if some currently canon games were rendered non-canon, but Nintendo does still occasionally choose and announce that Zelda games are going to be or are currently regarded as non-canon."
13278,"I believe the book says that Link falls in battle with Ganondorf rather than Ganon, so that would be in Ganon's castle right before the final fight (or in front of Hyrule Castle as a child)."
13325,"We're told in TP that the TP sages have been around since ""ancient times"", long before the events of OoT."
13508,"And soon to be a fourth right after it, I believe. Hyrule Historia, Arts and Artifacts, Zelda Encyclopedia, and Hyrule Graphics."
17038,"Apparently the Japanese and German versions of the game have longer speeches where Zelda doesn't stop with the embers of twilight bit and continues by saying, ""whether across the seas or in making a connection to the past"", which sounds like references to TWW and ALttP. So if they are meant to be references to previous games, that would mean SS, OoT, TP, TWW, and ALttP now all take place on the same timeline or that whoever wrote the speech that Zelda is reciting knew about events from multiple timelines (and therefore we can't use the speech to determine which timeline BotW takes place in)."
30316,"Ah, it might be. I just know that three books were announced for the 30th anniversary. Maybe they haven't announced what the third book is yet."
80405,"We weren't specifically told that they were reincarnations, but you are correct that they had to be awakened to sagehood in whatever that entails. I remember at least one character saying she heard the Sacred Realm calling to her, and when she started listening to that voice, she realized she was meant to become a sage. But whether that's because it was her destiny or because she was a sage in a past life might be up for debate."
