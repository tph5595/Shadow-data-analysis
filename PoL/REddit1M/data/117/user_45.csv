27284,"This is dumb. There might be timelines in which Link dies in every single game, perfectly. Do some of our games take place in that timeline? No. So then, as they cannot be observed yet, their are not taken into account. 

Is the many worlds theory. There are infinite timelines that diverge from every decision we make, but as we only are conscious in one reality, we cannot perceive the others. Anthropic principle and all that stuff. So yeah, maybe there is a timeline when Link has itchy ass and decides to scrach it with the Master Sword. Does that timeline has something to do with the others? There is a game now in that timeline? Nope, so why would it be taken into account in Hyrule Historia or wherever. We see the timelines that we have experienced through the games. 
The timeline could have things wrong, but you people sometimes interpret it in the simplest way possible and looking for what can you say it is wrong."
