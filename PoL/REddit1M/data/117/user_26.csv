12503,"For point 2, my favorite theory that I heard is that Ganondorf got the Triforce, defeated Link, and caused the Downfall timeline. When ALttP Link wished on the Triforce, it changed history and made the triforce split when Ganondorf touched it- ushering in the Adult timeline (allowing for the ""failure"" of the past to be fixed). From there on, things progressed as understood. It's a bit convoluted, but it is the only way I can see the downfall timeline not existing as some foolish alternate-universe thing."
