69410,"It... at least theoretically, could be how time works. Of course it would be tremendously odd, and the real challenge to it isn't contradictory histories per se but contradictory material.

If a building exists in one timeline, for instance, but not another, that's a problem. But if both timelines, despite their histories, ultimately converge in material similarity, thus the material existence of both universes at some point in the future is identical, then they could converge without incident.

More to the point, if both universes are - in the future - identical, then dependent upon the physical laws of the multiverse it may be the case that identical reality = same reality.

Imagine a point being plotted on a graph at coordinates 2,3. Later a different but identical point must be added at 2,3. Though they *were* different data points, they must share that identical point in space and so must converge on it. Two items of information become one when viewed on the graph.

Were the universe a computer simulation, for instance, this convergence approach would save on processing two realities which have become fundamentally identical. But a more natural interpretation of the universe may benefit from this nature too, for example if the universe is describable as a mathematical function... there should be no need for the number 2 to exist twice.

Anyway, dragon breaks and convergence in the manner we may be witnessing in the Zelda series certainly do not make sense. I prefer the interpretation that each game is a perhaps misremembered legend, and so the great sea which flooded Hyrule is mistold generations later by people passing on the legend and in Wind Waker we do not play events as they actually occurred but instead play the legend as it is one day told."
