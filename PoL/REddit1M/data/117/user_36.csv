19465," Yes the timelines could converge like that and it would have been the smart way to do it if they wanted to distill the series back down to one timeline moving forward.  Unfortunately, as it stands,  BOTW is full of direct contradictory references to all timelines.  So you are really left with three or four options, none of which are very pleasant:

 1. Dragon break style timeline combination (Link both did and didn't defeat Ganon, Link both remained in the child timeline and remained in the adult timeline.  All at the same time.  This is headsplittingly confusing.)
 2. Wishy washy explanation of references not exactly meaning what we think of.  ""Oh no that is a different Ruto becoming a sage and helping a different hero.  Totally nothing to do with OoT""  
 3. Large swaths of the game are just fanservice non canon references. (this is probably the reality of it, the creators were probably not heavily concerned with exact timelines and lore and just wanted to throw in a mishmash of references since this was such a ""rebirth"" of zelda) although this still leaves us in a daze to try and figure out what we can call ""real"" and what not as the devs cackle  toying with our minds.  
Or 4., which really is similar to 2 and 1, in an attempt to merge timelines with this rebirth of Zelda they heavily retcon all previous games, effectively changing just small parts (again super wishy washy because they're not actually doing or saying anything) so that somehow the events of each game all happen and make sense in one continuous timeline.

So yeah, not fun for anyone trying to apply consistent follow-through logic to an overarching lore. 

Hilariously they even kinda managed to break my headcanon of 15ish years,  that it is literally just the *legend* of zelda. All a story of evil and good,  different versions being told by different societies.  i.e. the island dweller who has only known the life of the sea tells his kids about the world beying flooded with an ancient kingdom beneath it.  Or in another land grandpa makes up a second follow up story, this time a little kookier than the last when his grandchildren whine that they want to hear more about their favorite bedtime hero,  the ""hero of time"" But that makes BOTW some kind of almost meta story, which wrecks up even my mundane headcanon."
