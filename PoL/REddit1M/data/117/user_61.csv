45756,"Occam's Razor: Some events that took place in one time line eventually took place in other timelines. Or similar events did. Did Ruto awaken as a sage in the Adult timeline? Yes.

But who says she didn't in the child timeline, only off-screen? Or that **another** Zora called Ruto didn't awaken as a sage down the line in a timeline that wasn't the Adult timeline? Besides the names Zelda and Link, others are passed down despite a lack of their bearers being reincarnated, such as Beedle and Impa. Maybe **a different** princess Ruto awakened as a sage in whatever timeline ""Breath of the Wild"" takes place in."
