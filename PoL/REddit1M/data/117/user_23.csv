11647,"Well, a couple of things:

1) The LEGEND of Zelda. And as such, legends change over time with each retelling. No part is permanent. Why exactly are we assuming an infallible storyteller? Even in this age we argue over stuff recorded as history that happened a mere 75 years ago. But if that isn't a good enough response, see also:

2) Why is there even a ""The Hero Dies"" timeline split at OoT? He doesn't die in the game. The ""Downfall Timeline"" is bad and they should feel bad. Also:

3) The Breakfast Cereal must be considered part of the official canon. I mean really, that stuff was delicious."

12463,How did he fail? I mean did he not know the bottle trick?
13068,"How does Skyward Sword embrace continuity? If anything it's the least contiguous because it has nothing it needs to adhere to.

Actually, how is TP more continuity embracing than WW? Didn't WW pretty much say ""Bro, because the hero teleported away, we got jack"" ?"
13137,Wait. There's a third book? Be still my wallet.
