Zelda already has the concept of different dimensions established with the golden realm/dark world, twilight realm, lorule, and to some extent kholint and termina.

Never understood why it's so hard for some fans to accept that Zelda might have some things from the different ""timelines"" appearing in various games, regardless of what timeline it sits on."

Hell I'm a die-hard fan since 1987 and even I don't care about timeline consistency. It's fun to theorycraft but when it comes down to the games I'm all for them going with whatever they think is going to make the game fun, timeline be damned."
105803,"&gt; Even in interviews as far back as summer 2002, months before Wind Waker released we have aonuma and miyamoto on record talking about a split timeline after the adult and child endings

Because fans were bugging the shit out of them after they had mentioned back around OoTs release that they had a loose timeline the games follow, then WW throws a wrench in that so they came up with the split timeline. Then TP throws a wrench in the 2 timeline concept so around SS and years of fans arguing there must be a 3rd timeline they come out with Hyrule Historia.

They've also said that they don't let the timeline dictate what they want to do with the series. If they think of a cool idea for the next game, they don't scour the timeline and fret over whether Rito and Zora can exist together, or that Koroks have only been in the adult victory timeline before."
