18744,I just posted a thread over in r/breath_of_the_wild about discussing timeline theories.  Come share!
18805,I could see that being a very emotional plot.  I dig it.
19025,But how would Zelda even know about the Hero of Time if this is the child timeline?  He becomes the Hero's Shade in TP because he never gets recognized for being a Hero.
