2247,"I honestly believe that BotW will be in a joined timeline. Where and how that joining occurs is anyone's guess. 

I also believe that it exists on the Downfall Timeline. I know that seems contradictory... but I feel that the Downfall timeline is the ""true path"" of Hyrule's history (argument could be made for the Child timeline), and the other two will be merging into it (as opposed to all three merging into a new one, though that isn't out of the question). Now, where BotW (and the events mentioned in the game leading up to BotW's events) takes place on that merged timeline is anyone's guess as well. I tend to think its at the very end (as in, all the events even MENTIONED in BotW take place well after AoL) *or* that the events IN BotW are post AoL, whereas the events leading UP to what happened in BotW (the 10k year period or so) come somewhere between the the Golden Era and pre-AoL)

I've a few theories on the matter if anyone is interested (but, Zelda theories are a dime-a-dozen, lol).

At any rate, should be fun to see where they decide to take the story next!"
