24576,"What if he's adding a fourth timeline? Like if twilight princess link was killed by ganon who then took over hyrule so the godesses decided to create a huge flood and OH LOOK! IT'S LIKE WINDWAKER! But the hero of time was preserved for many years like when he got the master sword, and returns to hyrule with the feirce deities mask and the dark power of the mask (greater than majora's.) damages the sacred seal sealing ganon away, but hero of time link doesn't know this and continues to look for navi, hoping a deity or great fairy has prolonged navi's life for all this time, the goddesses cause the great sea to evaporate, but link using the feirce deities mask survives and he returns to the lost woods eventually in search, ganon invades new hyrule, killing toon link, and the survivors return to hyrule and build guardians to fight ganon, and ganon gets harmed but he escapes, eventually returns, takes over when the guardians are buried but is killed. Then his next incarnation who arrives 10,000 years later is harmed when the guardians rise again but corrupts them and OH LOOK, IT'S BOTW!"
