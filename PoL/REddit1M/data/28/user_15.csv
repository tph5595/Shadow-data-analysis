7242,"I actually think the story is quite deep, but unlike other Zelda games its heavily lore based. Most Zelda stories are very linear and explicitly told to the player, but in BOTW there are tiny little details pebbled throughout that the player needs to piece together (kind of like Dark Souls).

As for Link, this is my theory: this version of Hyrule is very aware of the legend. They know Ganon is to be reincarnated, they know Zelda possesses the Triforce of Wisdom, but they don't know who their hero is. In another cutscene, Zelda mentions that Link has been following his father's footsteps and trained to become a knight. So what I think happened is that when the knights come of age, they try and pull the Master Sword. Eventually Link came along and he was able to pull the sword, making him the chosen hero of the legend.

I thought the story seemed rather shallow too, but when the think longer about certain interactions and why they're there, things start to add up and make a lot more sense."

22301,I'd hope that they'd get the same warning :P
23315,"I actually kinda liked the interpretation of Ganon in this. Every other game he's been incarnated as a character with a motive, but I think it's interesting to have him be just a pure physical destruction and devastation that brought Hyrule to an apocalypse. In really instilled that feeling of helplessness, like the world is ending, and there's nothing you can do to stop it. Technically, Ganon isn't really a character, but he's the evil spirit of Demise that would affect Hyrule for generations to come, and why every Zelda game exists in the first place."
25462,Did you get the true ending?
27109,"Huh. I actually really liked the ending. There wasn't anything about it that was really unexpected or left me feeling unsatisfied, it felt like a generic Zelda happy ending. I also think it kinda left the possibility of a sequel/post-Ganon DLC?"
27764,"I see your point. They could've shown more like that in the credits. Otherwise, I personally enjoyed it, but I prefer very simple, to the point type endings."
