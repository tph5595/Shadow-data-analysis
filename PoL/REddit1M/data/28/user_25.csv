11690,Final boss and ending were horrible. Thats my biggest complaint. The rest of the game imo is fantastic.
25694,Yep and its very disappointing.

There is a ton more they could have done to make it have impact. Ocarina of Time had an incredible ending sequence as well as Majora's mask. This is one of the worst zelda endings ever."
