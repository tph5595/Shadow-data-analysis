35459,"The whole memory photo aspect was perfect for this. So many open world games struggle to work in their story and quest with the open world design of the game. Skyrim tried to do this with dragons appearing in the wild, Oblivion with the gates, GTA does it with radio news, but Zelda is one of the only open world games that has woven it into the actual act of how we play the game. We were allowed the space to breathe and go at our own pace, without feeling like we were ignoring the plight Zelda was going through.

Personally I miss the Zelda formula, so I can see where people complaining are coming from. But the best stories in Zelda have always been architectural or otherwise presented in the background and this game delivers there as well as any other. That said, I think Skyward Sword without any tutorials (goodbye Fi) and with an actual explorable space between the ground areas would have been the perfect Zelda experience."
