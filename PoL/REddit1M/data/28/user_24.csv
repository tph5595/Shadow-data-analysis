10268,Because if Zelda would be dead she couldn't hold Ganon back for 100 years...
10378,"""traditional"" Zelda... I know what you mean but... BotW is more traditional than OoT and the other 3D Zelda games..."
10446,Not every game had Ganon talking and the Triforce as plot hole... in the most games of the Dawnfall timeline Ganon was just a evil beast without dialogue...
10589,Most likely the original name of the Bolson Constraction. In the German version they all ended with -da and not with -son... would fit Sakurda which also ends with -da. And the German version is closer to Japanese then the English one.

89223,"River Zora exist in dawnfall timeline too. The friendly Zora were in the Oracle games. And even ALbW has some friendly Zora.
And I personally thing location names are just easter eggs and nothing more. Amiibo are just bonus content which are not canon.
Korok and Rito could evolve in any other timeline to under other circumstances. 
I personally thing the Dawnfall timeline has the most ground at the moment. But who knows?"
