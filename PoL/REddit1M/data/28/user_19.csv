8311,"I think its because Zelda had the Triforce (or whatever its called in this game....""The Golden Power""?), which prevented her from being killed by Ganon &amp; prevented her from aging. "

I think Nintendo should have added a simple 'hunger' system, where if you're too full...you can't eat anything after a certain amount of time. This would add strategy: So you can either eat 1 big meal with a bunch of bonus hearts, or like 50 apples, but you can't eat both within like 10 minutes or something, ya know? Or maybe they should have added an option for that system for players that wanted it.

The bosses in BotW really sucked, even the overworld bosses. There was almost no variety in their appearance (except for reskins, or a different weapon in the case of dungeon bosses), and it would have been really cool to have region specific overworld bosses that aren't reskinned to another area.

The jungle could have had a Gohma/spider-like boss that you find by dropping into a cave or something. Death Mountain could have had Volvagia diving in and out of the lava pools). The coastlines could have had the giant eel like monster from the water temple in Twilight Princess (or something close to it), or huge sharks like in MM. You get the idea. 

But instead we got reskins of Talus, Hinox, and the occasional Stalnox. The only overworld boss I did like was Molduga, but only because it was different &amp; reminded me of the worms from Tremors.  

Also, there was not enough normal enemy variation. I get that there's different levels/colours of enemies, but that's not enough. Simply adding a different colour &amp; more health to a Boblokin doesn't make it a different enemy. Its still a Boblokin.

We basically only got Boblokins, Moblins, Keese, Chu-Chus, those mini-talus things, and the occasional aggressive animal. That's 5 types of enemies. That's not enough for an open world game that claims its breaking the conventions of Zelda, and I expected more frin Nintendo.

The Divine Beasts &amp; their bosses all felt the same, and like you said, they didn't have any distinguishing features that separated them from each other.

The final boss was way too generic and too easy. The spider form was okay (if too easy), but the final form was a joke.

I've completed 107 shrines so far, and it seems like the  majority of them seem to be Test of Strength/Blessing ones. WTF is that shit? I want puzzles to solve. This *is* a Zelda game, right? 

Don't get me wrong. Overall, I love the game. But its not the greatest Zelda ever created, nor is it the best game ever created. It has a lot of flaws, and many things I wish they would have done better. And it certainly isn't a masterpiece like everyone is claiming it is. "

I agree, the Like-Likes would have been perfect especially with the gear system. Maybe they could have stolen more than 1 kind of gear/weapon that you have on you, and you obviously would have to kill it to get it back. 

Deku Babas would have been nice in the jungle area. They could have blended in with the local vegetation, hung down from the huge trees, etc. 

I too hope the DLC adds a whole bunch of new enemies. "
