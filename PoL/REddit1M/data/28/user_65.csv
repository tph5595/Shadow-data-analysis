65690,"So I just defeated Calamity Ganon like, 10 minutes ago.

Yeah, it wasn't as good as I had hoped and a lot of people were right, it was a let down. I thought phase 1 was really cool. Seeing the champion's let loose and blast that [Infermon](http://img10.deviantart.net/ac69/i/2015/127/4/6/infermon_by_cottonvalent-dpq8ye.jpg) was awesome.

The fight was a little confusing. He sent a giant fire ball at me and I'm thinking ***ARE WE GONNA PLAY ZELDA TENNIS!? I LOVE ZELDA TENNIS!!***

And then it blew up in my face. I had to simply parry or avoid it (maybe an arrow would have helped?) 

The laser reflection was nice too, but when half his HP is already gone, there wasn't a lot of use for it.

Urbosa's Fury hit him for a nice amount, which is a shame because you'd think he'd be tougher than that?

Then the final beast form was... Meh. A leisurely trot around him wasn't too hard. He had like, one attack and there wasn't much to do other than just kinda... Wait.

The eye on his forhead opened up and it took me a while to fire into the damn thing. My stamina ran out and I died hitting the ground, but Mipha's Grace brought me back.

Now I'm gonna start TP HD and buff up that Wolf Link amiibo for my second playthrough."

I was gonna say like Metroid Prime. There's the main story you get from hunting down the Pirates, but if you take the time to read the lore that you scan from Chozo ruins and Pirate Data, there's a whole other world you haven't even touched yet!

Plus it gets stored in a handy file system you can read whenever you like."
65941,"Goron City has always been my favorite musical track. Whether it was OoT or TP, I always loved hearing that song.

And now Death Mountain was just... Blah."
66019,"I was in the tundra, far North West area.

I was going up and down this mountain following shrine beeps, but I couldn't find the damn shrine.

I look online for a hint and apparently there's a shrine like, *inside* the mountain. I can't for the life of me find the entrance."
66369,"I dunno about you, but I never really learned or used the shield reflection that much."
66644,"Pfft, I just wanted to kill Ganon so I swam up the waterfalls and was at him in like, 40 seconds."
66870,"Like, once.

The champion's took him down to half health. Otherwise I shot him with ancient arrows from an ancient bow and just hit him with the Master Sword.

I had to shield reflect when he got all glowy.

I'm just saying it wasn't a skill I ever used during any other part of the game."
68273,"Once I got the Master Sword, I started hunting the Guardians.

I'd hide and wait for them to get close and start chopping their limbs off.

If they'd try to get away, I'd Stasis them and hack off more legs until they couldn't flee.

Then I'd wail away at them.

Okay, I guess I'm a little sadistic."
68299,I got all the memories. I'll admit I couldn't figure this one out so I looked up online where it was.
68521,"Nope. At that point I just wanted the memories and moved onto the rest of the Divine Beasts.

What is it, the Hylian Shield?"
