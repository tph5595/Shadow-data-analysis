8017,"I'm at around 65 shrines and I'm feeling like I'm struggling harder and harder to find more. Which, let me be clear, is awesome. What's your strategy for finding shrines? Just ride around with your Shieka Sensor on? I don't want to have to resort to online guides/maps. "
8674,"Completely disagree. 

First of all, it's important to note the intention of the developers, and the clear intention was to *avoid* ""plot."" Plot and Story are different. Skyward Sword is a heavily plotted game, which is what lead it to being so linear. You had to hit these story beats in a certain order, and it felt restrictive for a lot of players. 

So BOTW is intending to create a story that's discovered rather than told. The story is uncovered  through memories which are discovered by the player, as opposed to mandatory cutscenes. This allows for the kind of open gameplay it strives for. You can't have a game with the kind of storytelling present in the last few 3D Zeldas *and* have the game be as open as BOTW is. 

The story, as it was in the original Zelda games, is mostly functional. It gives the player a reason to be in this world. It gives you a strong beginning and ending, but the middle is up to the player. 

But as for the content of the story itself, I think it was rather good. Having the story center around a society that saw an evil coming, tried to prepare for it, and *failed* was inspired. Seeing these flashbacks of Zelda realizing how futile her prayers are, how inevitable defeat is...it was powerful stuff, IMO. 

So no, not the best Zelda story, but it's absolutely not the point of the game. "

17567,"Exactly. It's been decades since a Zelda game allowed for this kind of personalized experience. Did this story give me the sort of wistful sense of adventure that, say, Wind Waker did? No. But it didn't need to because the gameplay itself accomplished it. It allowed me to create my own narrative, and that's the beauty of the game. "
