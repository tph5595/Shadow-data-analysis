The story was honestly so mediocre that it alone made it so BoTW wasn't my favorite Zelda game (although for the first 30 hours I thought it could definitely be it).

Still absolutely adore the game, thought it was 11/10 when I was playing it, nearing the midway point and after I beat it it started dropping to 9/10.

Gonna use the ""Its an amazing game, its just not an amazing Zelda game"" line. Even though in essence it is THE Zelda experience taking a majority of its inspiraton from game 1.

Reinforcing the fact that yes, I love this game! I just think that now that my 'honeymoon' period with the game is over I can tell that it is not the very best of the series and that although gameplay is and always should be the main focus of a video game, story should be regarded as a large part of the experience, especially since the series has built itself up to be known for having a stronger connection with its story with each installment, and the advertisements built it up to look like it had a huge amount of events we could be part of just to find out we had already seen a majority of all cutscenes. 

TL ; DR Gameplay = 90%, Story = 10% of a game."
