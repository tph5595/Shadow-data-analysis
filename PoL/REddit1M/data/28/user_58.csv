But the dungeons were extremely easy and repetitive. They all had the same boss but with a slightly different gimmick. There was no triforce quest, you have no reason to get the master sword or the green tunic. 

You never talk to Ganon. His boss battle is fun, but I expected more.

What I absolutely hated was that the only thing the divine beasts do is [bring Ganon down to half health](/spoilers). That was so underwhelming. You get told all throughout the game that they are the key to defeating ganon and all that shit. At the end it just saves you a few minutes."
