1501,"I just finished the game yesterday. Botw is without doubt one of the best games I ever played. But I do think that the story has less depth than other zelda games... the developers used a different aproach to tell the story, which is awesome and refreshing, but it left me with some questions about what happened. My biggest question is, how does link get the master sword in the first place? (what did he do to deserve it?) Even in one of the cutscenes zelda asks herself/him how does he deserve to wield that sword? So, what are your thoughts guys?"
1623,I agree with you. It'd add more depth and personality to the characters.
2391,"Damn, I wish I could play as Link from 100 years ago, before Ganon's resurection... I'd love to know Zelda, Daruk, Mipha, Urbosa, Prince Sidon and Purah better! They seem to be wonderful characters, and I do care about them."
7832,"It does make sense when you put it that way. Maybe it's because the game is still so recent and there are some things that didn't get discovered by me or other players which could help to understand better the plot and what happened 100 years ago with more detail. I just only found 2 diaries at Hyrule Castle, and they were really great to the lore, but I don't know, I wish there was more of it."
9454,"Yeah I also thought exactly that. That Riju, Sidon and the other two were going to be the new champions. But that's nice because the game plot wasn't so predictable as I thought."
