And Samurai Jack is fucking amazing.

It is a game where Link must learn how to survive first, then become an adventurer, and slowly after that, a hero...again. There is a lot of exploration that a non urgent story allows you to do. It felt Ghibliesque for me sometimes, sitting under a rock during a rainstorm trying to cook, or climbing trees to get  better vantage points of where to go. Other stories just don't allow this level of, ""go at your own pace""."
22491,Agree in that I feel like Nintendo is gravitating away from this Triforce as a physical object on its own and more a phrophetic symbol of the three chosen ones and their legendary conflict throughout time.
22590,"Agree in that I would have liked to see a more native plot in object descriptions, posters, and word of mouth ala Dark Souls. There is a lot already but it could have been more uniform."
22851,"Well I think the Goddess Hylia might be the one we see in the Temple of Time, but the three found at the fountains are the Goddesses of the Triforce. The universe mixing aspect is very cool and reflective of real life in some ways. It's also Nintendo's first true nod to an overarching canon that includes all of the games in one single timeline"

I too was expecting them to revive in Disneyesque fashion after completing my first dungeon. Speaks to the realism that does exist in what is an unrealistic world - that death actually does mean death, even if their spirit lives on. Studio Ghibli inspired at its finest."
23298,"Agree. Really surprised to read accounts like these. Just sounds like some people wanted to replay their beloved Zelda game more than play its new, refreshing descendent. 

Not to mention the music in this game is unbelievable. Korok forest theme is one of my favorite in a videogame."
23462,"Agree that his final encounter felt somewhat rushed. It's like they completely succeeded in everything else about the build-up, (Hyrule Castle and its music was unbelievable), and then the boss has no dialogue and is done away with relatively quickly.

I still had my struggle with his first form, mostly because I had to solve the puzzle of how to damage him on the fly with no food, but after that, his second form almost felt throwaway."
