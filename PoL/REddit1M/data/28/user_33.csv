23967,"There's still has to be a few fools who thought they would be able and died IMO tho.

I wasn't suggesting everyone died but given how full of themselves some people can be I wouldn't rule it out altogether :/"
24073,"My point still stands, I think. When you reach the divine beasts they're out of control so spirits aren't even enough to hold Ganon back."
