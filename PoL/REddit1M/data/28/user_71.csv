86927,"Hearing that (I completed the story, but not ganon, because I want to do some other stuff) I am really concerned that this boss is easy. Hopefully Ganon is at least as difficult as a Lynel."
87245,"Its really messy this time around. I mean in Zoras domain you can find a Mikau and a Lulu Lake (characters that only exist in Termina (Child Timeline)), then we have the Amiibo(Yes the plural is Amiibo like Joy-Con) clothes, wich confirm all timelines. We have Korok, Rito (both Adult Timeline), then we have the River Zora (OoT, MM, TW all Child Timeline), the Hinox (Downfall Timeline) and one big clue is that the mastersword is in the woods. The Map layout is surprisingly similar to alttps and abw map. So i go with unified timeline this time around.
