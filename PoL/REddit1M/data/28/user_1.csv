504,"Am I the only one who was kind of disappointed that the champions of the divine beasts died? I was hoping that you could free them the same way you would free Zelda. I think that it would be cool to interact with them a bit more, and maybe do a few side quests. I feel like its a shame that they died."
1805,"I also think it would add more closure to the game, while I really enjoyed it, but some parts left me sort of ""empty"". "
2428,Same
4447,"I think that the game developers assumed that everyone who plays it is already a zelda fan. Because i already know about gannon, the goddesses, the triforce, and all the other creatures like Zora's or Gorons. but newer fans don't know that and it makes that game much more confusing. "
7600,"Yeah, but then why didn't zelda die and only her spirit remain to assist link? "
8700,that makes a lot of sense 
9028,Shit that would be so cool
11364,"I meant her spirit. because in BOTW even though the champions died, their spirits control the divine beasts. "
13022,"Thats nice but it breaks the whole concept of a total open world, it's possible you go directly from the first 4 shires to gannon's castle and beat the game before talking to any npc (except for the old man). If you were to structure the game in a way where you had to beat all the other dungeons first and collect a bunch of memories before beating vah ruta then it wouldn't be open world."
14539,Maybe at least be able to interact with the spirits of the fallen champions.
15037,Yeah
22190,yeah
22303,"Zelda wasn't enough to fight ganon either, she could hold him back a little because of the triforce, but in the end you still had to save her too."
60146,I know thats why I think that they all should of survived. 
63511,"They don't need to hold gannon back, they just need to control the divine beasts. "
