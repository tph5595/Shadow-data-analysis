4726,"Thanks to Zelda fans from yesterday, I've killed my first couple of Hinoxes &amp; Moldugas and ....

Zero Hinox guts in 3 kills, when I need 4 guts for upgrades. I got other Hinox parts, just no guts. Do I just need to keep killing more Hinoxes or do I need to find tougher Hinoxes?"
11320,"Are there any non-metal weapons that you can pick up for free? Aka, rain gear, when your gear breaks.

All I know of is the wood Forest Dweller's spear in the Lost Woods. I know about the wooden sword/shield/bow, but you have to do the trial every time, and sometimes you just want a freebie.

Also, any place for good 2 handers that respawn?

Killing Hinox and Molduga always seems to heavily damage your 2 hander, so I've needed constant replacements. I've been grabbing the Great Flameblade that respawns right next to the Lomei Labyrinth Shrine, but are there other free 2 handers out there that are good enough to take down Hinox/Molduga?"
