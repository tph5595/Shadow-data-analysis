5923,"I agree. The ending was lackluster. Ganon is just a monster, not the eternal antagonist of the hero and the princess. No Ganon Dialogue, no Triforce story element, nothing. "

I don't like that his only forms are just mindless beasts. He has no dialogue, no motives, just a cool looking enemy model with some O-K mechanics (except the final form, that was boring as hell). Even if they wanted to keep him beastly, they could have still given him a demise-like form that fought you to the death and had a few lines to cap the fight off."
