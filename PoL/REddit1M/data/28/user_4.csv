1526,"Pretty good open world game, but not a satisfying Zelda title. Actually, after the magic of the first hours were gone, I found myself desiring to replay an older Zelda title instead.

I totally miss the memorable and atmospheric music Zelda games had until now and were famous for. This is my biggest gripe, because music creates emotions.

I miss the long and tricky dungeons, with unique atmosphere, taking hours to clear, containing a new helpful gadget. 

I miss bosses with varied mechanics, where I have to find out their specific weaknesses and maybe die because I can't find any hearts lying around.

I wish they would have made a traditional Zelda instead and released BotW as a new IP."

Copy/Paste bosses and 5 minute dungeons (which I forgot another 5 minutes later) might be enough or just right for this generation (short attention span, mobile games and stuff), but I expected more from Nintendo."
11580,"Depends on your definition of a traditional Zelda. For me the Zelda tradition starts with Alttp. From there on they developed a tradition like I mentioned in my post (doesn't matter if 2D or 3D). Everything before Alttp was more ""experimenting"" and searching for identity."
