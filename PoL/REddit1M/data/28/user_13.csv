It's so far in the future that all the other games have become legend, in-universe. The cycle is now a legend both in our world and theirs.

That said, my one complaint about the plot was that there wasn't enough of it."

Got 14 left, most of them shrine quests. All I'm finding now are ""blessings"" and ""tests of strength""; actual puzzle shrines seem to have disappeared."
