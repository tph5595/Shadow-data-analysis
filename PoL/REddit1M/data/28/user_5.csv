1546,"I must admit. I love the game. Absoloutly adore it. I've never felt so free to go out and make my own adventures.

However. Let's be honest. The overall plot is terrible. The 'Legend' of Zelda just isn't alive. One triforce reference. We're told Ganon is this horrible being, but we hardly ever see him. He doesn't communicate. There's no fear.

Is that it? No more Ganon? 
Is that it with the Triforce?

Are we moving onto a new ""Legend"" of Zelda?

1803,Agreed. The music was a disappointment. I was looking forward to hearing Song of Storms / Song of Time etc.
