Maybe I'm just getting old but I feel like it's too time intensive. It takes forever to get anywhere, especially before you've unlocked many of the shrines. The whole rain mechanic is really frustrating, as I find myself having to just wait out a rainstorm because I can't keep climbing but don't want to go anywhere else because I've already made so much progress. The bosses just don't feel like Zelda bosses, which is a shame because the boss fights were some of my favorite things about previous games.

However, I really applaud the leaps in storytelling they've made in this game - I really liked the flashbacks and the general story of the game."

I've never been able to get into the isometric Zelda games - I'm not really sure why. I've played all of Link's Awakening, almost all of A Link to the Past, and about half of A Link Between Worlds, but I'm just not a fan of the isometric Zelda games."

Let's just say I lasted less than 5 seconds against it, lol...."
23239,"I do like the game, I just mean it's not my favorite. It just seems to be lacking some spark for me for some reason. 

And yes, I have greatly appreciated the Rito ability - it's saved my bacon more than once when there was a sudden rainstorm :)"
