12580,"After about 60 hours I finally killed my first lynel on Sunday. Spent a good part of yesterday hunting lynels. It's my new favorite thing to do in this game. The battle is intense and fun (especially silver lynels. Those things are awesome), and the loot is crazy good. 

Also had a bit of a hilarious moment. Right after killing the lynel in the coliseum there was a blood moon so I had to beat it again. Twice the fun. "
18566,My first experience was similar. I think my first one was after Kakariko Village and I got wrecked. Took me 50 hours and an extra 13 hearts to gain the courage to take one on.
