27828,"I haven't finished the game. I've only met impa and then visited the Zora domain. Don't spoil the rest if you reply.  
Now, I have a question/theory. Is the hero from 100000 years ago the fierce deity? Based on the mural the king had, the hero of that time weilded a double helix sword that looks very similar to the one the fierce deity had. In Majora's Mask, the three transformation masks looked similar to their original selves. The fierce deity mask, however, looks like an adult version of link.  
  
Theory aside, I'm in love with this game. The open-ness is unbelievable. I've been seeing gameplay videos of parts I've completed to see how others did it and everything is different. For example, the video I saw for getting to the Zora domain had the player swim up the river and walk along the bridge to the domain. I, however, didn't take a step in the water and used cryosis all along, forming a staircase on the waterfall to reach the lower level of the domain. "
