9598,"As a ""fan"" of Zelda but having never actually played one properly before this one (I got through the water temple in OoT but stopped after that), I wasn't confused much at all. It was actually a very organic learning experience. I was able to ask NPCs about things that caught my attention in the dialogue but didn't understand.

For example, on my way to discover who or what a Rito is, I found a guy on a tower trying to study them. The main quest already explained to me that they're one of the four races in this land, but then I asked the guy what they were and he said they're birds that shouldn't be able to fly according to the laws of physics, but they still can.

I thought it was great. If I was ever confused about something, it was usually more intrigue rather than confusion. The lack of explanation made me seek out more information. It drove me to explore and learn about this new magical world that I had only a few sneak peeks at throughout my childhood."
