19746,Just wait for them to release Zelda: Reach.
19815,"&gt; I saw a bird fly into a pond and turn into a drumstick last night.

Was it a cold pond?  Did they turn into frozen drumsticks?"
20188,"I feel a bit like Nintendo is trying to get away from the whole Triforce thing ever since Ocarina of Time, where the Triforce only featured as little growing triangles on people's hands.  It was as if they wanted to show that the triforce is always in these characters, so there's no need to bring it up in later games.

Strangely absent from later games is references to Din, Farore, and Nayru, the golden goddesses that created the triforce.  You often have three dragons with similar names, but the religion is all about the Goddess Hylia now, at both the beginning and end of the timeline at this point.

And yeah, no Ganon dialog because he didn't reincarnate, just stayed a big ball of evil this time.  Also there wasn't any Ganon dialog in the first Zelda game.  You just show up and fight him."
20518,"I think it's even more confusing if you come to it with prior Zelda knowledge.  The goddesses and the Triforce are never mentioned, but you meet dragons with similar names like in Skyward Sword.  Zelda canon has switched to the Goddess Hylia now, at both the beginning and end of the timeline, for some reason."
20976,"Skyward Sword does have some pretty impressive boss battles, especially Koloktos.

Personally, it's the slow-paced linear storytelling of Skyward Sword and Wind Waker that turn me off to those games, but perhaps it's what you like.  I much prefer being able to run up into the mountains and knock over rocks looking for koroks and such.

If you find the going too slow in Breath of the Wild, try catching a good horse and sticking to the main roads for a bit.  You'll find lots of interesting stuff on the roads, like stables and side quests.  You can head for the hills when you see something interesting.  Also, if you do the divine beast of the Rito, you'll get an ability that makes climbing less important."
21149,Similar story.  As soon as I left the tutorial area I headed to the main quest points and got my photos and headed to the place Pikango in Karkariko tells you about for my first memory.  I took a few steps further and got wrecked by triple shock arrows.
21375,"To be fair, Hyrule Castle is pretty epic the way it transitions from trumpets to organ when you go in and out.  Also the Rito theme was some nice nostalgia from Wind Waker.  Also all of Kass's songs.  It'd be kinda cool if he played Song of Storms though, you're right.

Song of Time is in there, though it's slowed down and broken up so much it's hardly recognizable.  It plays at the Temple of Time on the Great Plateau."
21522,"&gt; I wish they would have made a traditional Zelda instead and released BotW as a new IP.

The game relies on existing races though.  I mean, I guess it worked for Skyward Sword for them to totally ignore the Zelda races, but I kinda like these guys.  The Rito are especially awesome."
21720,"Hyrule Castle is full of awesome two-handers.  Royal Guard gear is great.

As for lightning-safe stuff, I usually just knock over some common enemies and take their dragonbone equipment.  Ancient stuff is also lightning-safe for some reason."
23056,"Hyrule Castle is epic in this game.  Best CastleVania.  I love how it transitions from trumpets and marching on the outside to cool organ music on the inside.  The flames and soot filling the air outside really enhance the ambiance.  Seriously, why isn't there a CastleVania game like this?

I also like how non-linear it is, like everything in this game.  You can approach it lots of different ways.  Enter through the front door or sail in through the moat or ride the minecart or even just glide in through that gaping hole in the wall.  And there's even waterfalls to swim up with your Zora gear, Lynels to fight if you take the direct path, lots of twisting passages to explore with destructible walls, great weapons everywhere.  I spent a few hours making sure I'd visited every single place in the castle.

I also love how non-linear the divine beasts are.  It was really clever to change a ""traverse the dungeon from point A to point B"" task into a ""visit a bunch of places in any order"" task, so if one puzzle isn't making sense you can do something else in the meantime until you get a better understanding of the dungeon.  It feels a bit more like Banjo Kazooie in this way.  Also I love the dungeon rotation mechanics.  It reminds me of the desert dungeon in Majora's Mask.  The Gerudo one was pretty mind-bending.  Though I felt the Rito one was pretty trivial.  I hope more Zelda games do this non-linear puzzle solving thing in the future.

Also I love finding koroks!  It's a reward for observant players.

When I first started the game I was all like ""screw the main quest, I'm climbing mountains and flying around because I can!"" which was cool and all, but I eventually realized the proper way to play the game is to get a horse and follow the roads.  There's so much good stuff on the roads, and the traveling is much faster that way, so it actually makes the game more fun oddly enough.  I can head for the hills when I see something interesting.  I think I'd like to re-play the game a bit more in-character.  Get a horse, follow the roads, discover the towns and stables, ban fast travel, always eat food the moment I cook it, don't sell shit like monster parts that nobody would buy, and see how far that gets me.  The game is actually a lot more fun if you don't fast travel all the time, since you'll often end up noticing interesting stuff the second time you pass through the same place.

In this thread too many people complaining about the story. Imho, games don't need a story to be good. "
24507,I liked the boss. The part that happens in the castle at least. It uses a bunch of different mechanics you learn throughout the game. It's a good final test. The beast you fight afterward is just a victory lap though. 
24714,"Still it would have been a bit more believable to have living people fire the lasers than some ghosts. I do wish those characters got to get in the action and share some of the glory with you. Could have ended with a nice group shot of the champions, new and old, as the castle disintegrates in the background. "
24804,Done all the shrine quests yet?  Found all the stables?
33329,"Well maybe he's too easy if you already have all the divine beasts and the master sword.  I decided to fight him with only 3 of the beasts and no master sword since I was getting pretty curious about what's in Hyrule Castle and once I started exploring it I couldn't stop.  Maybe they'll make him harder in Hard Mode, or maybe I'll try and take him on without any divine beasts some time.

Anyway, he turns red for the last bit of the fight, which forces you to either get a perfect parry or a flurry rush in order to hurt him at all, which is a nice last test to prove you've mastered the combat in this game."
47485,"Stables only show up on roads, so just travel every road. Doesn't take too long.  Stables have a lot of NPC quest givers. "
66487,How did you beat Ganon then?  Flurry rush?
68053,"Right, I'm talking about the glowy part.

Oh, I was shield-parrying guardians for days before I fought Ganon :P."
68148,"I noticed most of the lower waterfalls you couldn't swim up.  But yeah, I still think it's neat that you can approach it in different ways.  I recommend exploring the castle a bit, btw, since there's great weapons, great ambiance, and you'll even find one of the memories there."
68410,Did you find the treasure in the basement?
68846,Yep.
