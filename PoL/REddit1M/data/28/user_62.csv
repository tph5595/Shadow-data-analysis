57322,"I’ve played every Zelda game (except Zelda 2), and this has to be my favorite one to date.  

They did an amazing job with the open world, probably the best iteration of it I’ve seen from any game. Traversing the environment was very satisfying, and the world feels very alive throughout.  

The game starts off extremely strong. The beginning area, making my way to the Kakariko village, and doing my first Sacred Beast (chose the Zora one) will go down as some of the best moments I’ve had in any game.  

Unfortunately, after this the game goes flat, and this is my main criticism of the game; progression.  

As you progress through the game, it doesn’t keep up. Enemies you fight in the late stages of the game are only slightly more complex than those you fight in the early stages, with damage/health numbers being the main difference. It does little to keep up with the knowledge, skill, and abilities you accumulate as you move through the game.  

As a result, the more I played, the more trivial everything became. A large part of what made the game so fun at the start for me was gone after completing my second sacred beast, not even half way through the overall game.  

Something else which disappointed me was the lack of “dungeons”. Hyrule Castle was as close as it got, and I had a lot of fun exploring it. I wish they had more stuff like that in the game.  "

Music was a huge part of previous games. They had you playing songs in every 3d zelda game for effects (changing the weather, the flow of time, opening dungeons, teleporting), and between this and the amazing music, it was some of the most memorable aspects of the game.  

But in BotW, music playing is gone, and the music isn't very memorable. I can't recall anything but what is played at the stables, fairy fountain, and hyrule castle.  

The lack of lengthy puzzles, dungeons, and gadgets is definitely disappointing. Hyrule Castle is as close to dungeons as we get, and I had a blast there. For gadgets, I can understand why they gave every necessary tool at the beginning to allow freedom of exploration, but it also limits the value and excitement in exploring and rewards in general.
