I loved the game, and LoZ is my favourite ever gaming franchise, but people who think things like the OST, dungeons, bosses and broken health system hold a candle to the older games haven't taken the rose-tinted glasses off yet.

I barely recall a single song from the game, the one in the trailer was pretty good and the song in Zora Domain was good (only because it was very similar to the original in OOT though) but don't get me started on the Goron theme. Not for me.

The dungeons were just big shrines. I don't know what else to say. It was pretty cool that they were inside these huge mechanical beasts (which were spectacles in themselves, especially the Vah Naboris in the desert) but no real theme that cemented them or made them stand out in my mind. Also, they were just too short, and since there were only 4 of them, it was a huge disappointment.

I was watching boss-runs yesterday (TP, specifically) and I'm just so salty about these BotW bosses. I remember back in the day fighting the MM final boss, and thinking ""this is the best they could come up with?"" and it's the same here. Oh, this one has a spear? That one has a cannon this time? Give me a break. Lynels which you find everywhere are way more challenging, I haven't seen a single person deny that yet.

The biggest flaw of the game is the food/healing system. As soon as enemies can't 1-shot you (well, 2-shot with Mipha's blessing) the difficulty becomes a joke. No food cooldown, no HoT mechanic, no debuff that temporarily inhibits health recovery, no DS-style animation that you need to time carefully, nothing. As long as I don't get killed instantly by a single mistake, I could scoff like 20 apples one after another (Link has to use two fucking hands) and be back to full life again.

Sure, some of these problems might be seen as subjective and clinging to the older games but the healing is objectively badly implemented. You simply cannot reasonably argue Nintendo don't want this game to be a pushover with a bit of decent armour and heart containers after implementing this healing system."

Just expanding on your point on enemies, where the fuck are the Like-Likes?! This gear system was PERFECT for those guys! Really liked the Wizzrobes though, those things are creepy as hell in this game. So many missed opportunities for reintroducing cool old enemies... hopefully the upcoming DLC can maybe introduce some new monsters. We can only hope."
