14026,"No spoilers, please: once you defeat Ganon does the game do what normal Zelda games do and give you either the option to load from the last save before the fight or start a new game + (does this one have any NG+ stuff, be it a ""master quest"" or alternative costume?), or is it like Skyrim and lets you continue doing whatever you like after he's dead? There's still so much I want to do and I don't want to have to start again!"
