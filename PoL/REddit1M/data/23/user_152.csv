86175,Wait to break the game
86368,"So I've delayed taking down Waterblight Ganon (full clear of the beast, all chests, even took the pic of Ganon before porting out), and I think my main concern is sucking ass and weapons breaking during the fight... I got a few more shrines so that I'm at 3 Stamina boosts and 3 extra hearts, so I think it's about time I do and move the damn story forward lol.

Tips on bosses? Not strat, since I have the guide and know what the phases are and such but I'm just concerned with getting all panicky, and then just taking damage, wasting fairies and having weapons break while doing so. Most bows I have are from Amiibos (so 20+ dmg with dura up), wearing the hyrule set with +2* to each 3 pieces, and 4 knight shields (40) with dura up.

I'm ok with tips on how to cheese the boss... I'm not a patient one anymore lol"
86439,"There's a ""graveyard"" near the Dueling Peaks stable to farm.

Do you have the Guardian amiibo? drops 3 metal crates containing parts and a chest that usually has a core or something more valuable than a screw/spring/shaft"
86606,"they're in grass too but rarer. Also, the ones at fountains don't spawn if you have a certain number already on you... Prevents farming I guess"
86661,"I found my beetle in kakariko late one night (in game night) while amiibo farming, crouch to sneak up on it (don't forget the picture)"
86763,What he said... Not sure if I had a quest beforehand or not but I just made my way towards the zora area and you run into people who will start your next questline
86812,I'm guessing I need to do a few more steps of that quest first? Still need the Goron dude
86849,"Do the sidequests in the town... After a few, it'll unlock the one needed for that ball/shrine quest"
86943,Each great fairy opens up the next tier of upgrades
86995,"AS YOU SHOULD!

just kidding... Best strat is get high up enough with nothing blocking your line of sight for a good range, then look for the nearest tower and head to it"
87035,"Get some amiibos, about 90% of my fish and herbs are from them :)"
87399,"Nah, the shrine quests (ones that occur outside the shrine) can also hold cores"
87520,I've taken a decaying one out with just a very basic shield and perfect guard (parry the laser back at them)
87547,Is that tunic the only one that displays health bars?
87580,Like it'll bounce the laser back at them? Never tried that!
87638,It worked for Waterblight... Not sure if final boss will
89956,gotcha!
