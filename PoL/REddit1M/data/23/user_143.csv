82727,Does anyone have any tips for using the sheikah sensor?? I haven't found anything except for one shrine using it and it didn't even really help much with that. Ive had it set to sunshrooms and it goes off all the time and I haven't found anything. I've set it to other things too and the same thing happens. Random beeping
