70182,"This is a question regarding Lore, and the map, so I'll go ahead and spoil mark it... just in case.

[So, with some of the memories unlocked, and kind of playing through them.. It makes sense that this takes place in the same timeline as Twilight princess, and Ocarina of time.. However, the maps don't quite... equate. Am I missing something? The goron mountain, zelda domain, and Geruda valley are all in the same places, which defeats my original theory that the Hyrule castle moved from your starting position, north to where Ganon has it captured... which would be the only explanation for the temple of time being there.. But the lost woods are out of place. The Deku tree being there doesn't make sense, IMO... as his sappling dropped in the location of his death... which was Southeast of Hyrule castle, not north.. Am I reading too much into this, or is this confusing to anyone else?](/spoiler)
