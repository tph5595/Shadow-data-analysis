Example: picking up bugs. I first load into an area it will say 'bug detected', when I collect that bug and another is nearby it'll then say 'searching for new objective'"

21838,He tells you were he's going I think. Otherwise you can't really miss him once you reach a certain point in the game where all the koroks are.
22425,Rumor has it there's a man who visits a lake shaped like a skull each night.
22571,"It's a problem on both systems. There is something wrong with moblins ragdolling. It's especially bad if your weapon breaks and that is the hit which starts the ragdolling.  

Hopefully it gets patched out soon. Same with that multiple red moon bug/ red moon at the wrong time"
23180,It doesn't happen every time. I wouldn't worry much about trying to avoid them. The worst incident for me involving moblins was also at the castle.
23657,Check the mines.
23686,Not every set has a set bonus. In this case it is one of the sets that does not.

26526,Some places are colder than others. Refer to the temperature gauge to see if you are using enough. You can also tell by seeing if Link is shivering in the pause menu.

41433,"Follow the path leading up to Death Mountain and you might find something that'll help. I learned this the hard way by just dashing to the tower asap.

To make something yourself you'll need creatures from the DM region, you'll know which ones if you catch them. They have a distinct name."

Sadly its an issue affecting everyone. One way to improve performance would be to turn the resolution down to 720p in the systems settings, I hear that helps. Or playing in handheld mode of course."
48368,Try when you feel ready. They are more intimidating than they are strong.
50757,The Faron region. Closer to the south.
55850,"Certain shrines have bonus optional chests where you do a separate puzzle just for a chest and its in some of those. Might take a bit longer to find a shrine that does than it would to grind, though."
56001,Additional little tip - the stationary legless types have 1/3 the health of the walking types.
