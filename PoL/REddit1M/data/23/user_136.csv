75480,I am having trouble catching those little lizards that are material collectibles. Is there a trick to catching them?
81402,"Thanks guys this is very helpful! I only have two lizards to collect. The Hightail and the Fireproof. Are there any good locations to pick them up in their respective regions?

Got a massive checklist of materials to pick up for fully upgrading every bit of armour so I am asking about the ones I am having trouble with despite finding them. Stuff like the star fragments and dragons I have figured out already"
82682,"Oooh now that is super helpful! :)

That just leaves the Energetic Rhino Beetle, Hearty Blueshell Snail, Smotherwing Butterfly and the Silent Princess to find easily :D

Thanks a lot guys!"
