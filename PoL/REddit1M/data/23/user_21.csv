12008,"Is there a spoiler-free location guide for all shrines that only gives away their approximate location? 

I currently found 100 of them and have 15 shrine quests left (of which I've only found three so far), which leaves five just sitting out in the open. I'm still having fun exploring the world so I don't want to resort to a guide just yet, but I feel like there'll be a point when I'll be losing interest and don't want to wander around aimlessly anymore."
