8729,"No it slowly scales to your gear, generally. "
11310,"Not having armor does make it difficult. Get to the two towns and you can buy armor- that'll help. 

Is that what you're asking?"
15510,Some do. It depends which armor. 
15676,"There is DLC for the ""master quest."" Nintendo said something about a harder difficulty. 

At this point, you just continue from your last save like most Zelda games. "
15832,You can find maps for shrines with a simple Google search. 
15921,"I don't think any do, from what I've seen. 

A few shrines require dragon materials though. "
15987,"Ok hold on...

Here you go:

I don't see any spoilers either. "
17347,Where do you get that?
29752,There is one in the first guardhouse or something in the castle. I found him the easiest because it was a small area and it let me figure out the timing and strategy. You don't have to continue on to Ganon either.
81689,"You can find the traveling salesperson at the different stables. He usually sells the lizards and frogs of that region, I believe. I've found that helpful. "
81768,"Do you know where though? Everyone says you can buy another, but I've never seen where. "
81858,Go through the subreddit. There are a lot of discussions about the timeline. 
82074,"It's seems, and this might be anecdotal, that the guardians on the tests of strength drop the cores at a higher rate. Just go back through the tests and I bet you get lucky. "
82261,"You press A? Maybe that's what I've been doing wrong. I'll have to try tonight. I've just been pulling up my sheiks which seems to work, but I think it's just the lizard protection saving my ass. "
82444,"Yea just hold attack with a two handed weapon. You've got to have a lot of stamina but it is clutch. There's a couple two handed weapons it doesn't seem to work for, I think. Generally it works for everything though. "
82847,"The vendor will sell all that too, I believe. I know I just clear his inventory and I rarely have a hard time with all the critters. "
86327,"Yea I've broken a lot of good shields trying to figure it out. I find it easier to hit their eye with an arrow and run up and wreak havoc on them. A good two handed weapon and some spinning does the trick. 

Every once in a while I'll miss the arrow so figuring out the shield technique would be a huge help. "
