That gate has a pepper plant in front on the left and two behind it on the right. (I hope I am recalling it correctly...it was my go-to patch.) Otherwise, Satori mountain area has a big selection of veggies, an apple orchard, a durian orchard, and a huuuuge plot of pepper plants."

EDIT: Staminoka bass are hot pink and neon green. Restless crickets not grasshoppers!"

I don't have the game map with me right now but the area is SE of the Hebra region, the valley below Mount Rhoam, north of Mount Satori, and west of Central Hyrule. It always has a thunderstorm going on (shrine quest will trigger when you enter the area). It has these funky T-shaped trees and swamp."

From the bridge where you meet a traveler who wants to pray for his ancestors that died, paraglide to the right side of the fortress and climb straight up. It seems to be the buffer zone where the two Guardian Skywatchers don't overlap their search zones. Once you get to the top, it seems they don't scan that area right at the tower base.

EDIT: Paraglide across the broken bridge to the right side of the bridge and climb up the fortress walls from there."
