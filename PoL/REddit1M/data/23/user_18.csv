9689,"1. Endura carrots are your pal here. You can find them in the Faron region, I believe, but I don't have a mind for a more specific farming location. Staminoka bass are a common fish that help too (though less so than Endura items).

2. Carry a few wooden/bone weapons with you and switch to them when the lightning comes.

3. The Boss is around back."
9717,You cannot throw the Master Sword.
10572,"Most shrine quests take two forms. There's ""unexplained pedestal"" and ""location-triggered event."" For both, exploration is really the only way to find them. For the unexplained pedestals, there tends to be someone nearby who will trigger the quest. Some shrines can be accessed without triggering their respective quest, too - so making sure to talk to everyone is really important."
10975,"1. Other than shrine chests? Nope.

2. If you read the Journal of Various Worries in Impa's house, it may give you a clue of what you need to worry about before that one."
11049,"Compendium, Korok Seeds, mini-games/challenges, Tarrey Town, all other sidequests."
12942,"Medoh is pretty consistently regarded as the easiest. I would recommend that first, saving the more involved Naboris arc for last."
14180,"I haven't ever gone back to check, but I'm confident that they don't - there is a map function that shows whether you opened all of the chests in a shrine, and chests are not counted toward game completion %, so such a function would be pointless if the chests respawned."
15537,"It does what normal Zelda games do. There is currently no New Game +, but that may be included in DLC later on."
17747,Upgrade your Sheikah Sensor at the Hateno Ancient Lab. Then check out the options available from your map.
18439,"Does changing to a different item offer the ""searching for a new objective"" that you're looking for? Those are the only sheikah sensor abilities."
19082,"On the switch, you can create a new profile to start a new save file."
19746,"Please do, I'd love to help. Tag me or post a new reply so I get a notification.

Edit: Just saw the other response. Glad it was resolved."
32538,"1. Perhaps someone in Kakariko Village has it?

2. They should not be resetting while you are doing the quest. Are you staying in the area of the quest?"
33202,"1. Seems plausible to me, since you have an orb without a pedestal and a pedestal without an orb very near to eachother.

2. Yeah, the three brothers are all close enough as to not reset the orb locations. In fact, I don't think it should be resetting at all. Are you placing the orbs into the pedestals, activating them?  

I can say for certain that the game doesn't expect you to carry them all around the mountain with you."
71571,There's a book in her house that tells you what to worry about first.
