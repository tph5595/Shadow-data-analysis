54196,"Dumb question:

Is it feasible to obtain the Master Sword and the Hylian Shield before tackling the 4 Divine Beasts? 

Currently upgraded the Stamina Wheel once and at 5 hearts with 15 Shrines done. Having so much fun goofing around the map that I don't even want to get started with the main quests yet."
