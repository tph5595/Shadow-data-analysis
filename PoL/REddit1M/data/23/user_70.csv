If you don't have more than one article of warm clothing, try making an elixir with four cold-resistant critters and some Moblin Guts.  That ought to give you enough temporary protection for a jaunt through the cold.  Just get ready to beam out if it looks like you won't make it back to warm air in time."

1. On the hill above the Kakariko Village Great Fairy fountain, there sits an orange pedestal without its orb.  The orb doesn't seem to be in the pedestal's vicinity.  Where should I look?

2. The shrine quest where you take the three Hinoxes' orbs...I take an orb to one of the pedestals and go to get the next one, but the orbs' positions reset when I leave the pedestals' location.  Do I have to keep all of them with me at the same time?"

I assume that the Hinoxes' homes are not outside the quest area?"
