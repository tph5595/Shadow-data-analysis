41601,"I've noticed my game tends to slow down when I've been fighting Moblins and knocking them down. It becomes really noticeable when I've been fighting multiple. Has anyone else come across this issue? 

Is there anyway for me to improve the game running on my Switch? I heard there's been wifi issues that could possibly interfere with the game. Still loving the game though. 

Cheers"
