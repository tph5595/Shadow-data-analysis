21710,"[Wii U edition, physical copy] What's the worst framerate drop you've experienced? Last night I was fighting a group of Moblins north of the Rito Village, and the game literally froze for upwards of 5-6 seconds, several times during the fight. This wasn't ""a minor technical issue"", this was unplayable. And it's not the first time it's happened, although it always seems to get bad when I'm fighting Moblins. What's everyone else's experience? "
