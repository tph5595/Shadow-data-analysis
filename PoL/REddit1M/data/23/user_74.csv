32281,"They only come out during the rain. So try exploring places where darners are common, but when it's raining. "
32414,"1. You'll need to do a sidequest to get that one. So try spending more time around Kakariko. 

2. I didn't have this problem. Are you dropping the orb into the pedestal? It should disappear and turn the pedestal blue when you do. Also did you read the stone tablet? I think that starts the shrine quest and oh might need to have it started to prevent them from resetting. There might not even be a shrine quest for that though. "
32657,"Feed it an Endura Carrot. This gives it temporary stamina just like it would give Link if he cooked it. Swift Carrots might also increase speed, but I haven't confirmed that yet. "
32752,The Hylian set has no bonuses. And you only need two upgrades to unlock a set bonus. 
32945,Start a new game and complete it using only the Master Torch
33116,They don't restock while you have 100 or so in your inventory. I believe Beedle still restocks though. 
42642,I think the little kid running around in Lurelin Village actually starts it. He'll make you follow him from the village to the ruins. 
42855,Hmm that's weird. Do you have the camera rune yet?
43466,That explains it then. You need it to do the quest (and a few other quests)
53088,"There's a researcher you'll meet that will help you with gear specifically for guardians, which makes it much easier. But you can take them down at any point whenever you feel like taking the challenge. You'll get confident after you've beaten you're first one. "
53128,The Yiga Clan quest was probably the funniest joke I've ever seen in video games. 
53274,"Stronger versions of monsters do appear more often based on how many of those monsters you've killed. For example, once you've killed a number of red bokoblins, more blue bokoblins will appear and so on. They still only spawn in specific locations though. So all you're doing when you kill more enemies is making them stronger, but also giving them better loot. "
53455,"I'd say one of the biggest sidequests involves the builders at Hateno Village. 

Not really sure what you'd consider big. There's a group of people in a stable in the northwest region that'll make you travel all across the map for a quest. Most quests are found in the main villages and towns, but usually after you've defeated their respective divine beasts. "
53545,"Are you talking about the one the old man gives? He gives a big hint. Your map should be all the help you need. And yes, you'll need to take that raft. "
