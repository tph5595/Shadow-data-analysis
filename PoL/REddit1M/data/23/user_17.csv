9230,"I have 3 questions primarily, I'm deep into the game but I still cannot figure these out. Any help on any of them is much appreciated!

I have a hard time finding any resources that boosts stamina, in fact the only thing I can think of is honey which I only see every few hours of gameplay. Anyone have some good spots where they found a ton of stamina-boosting resources?

Also, any useful tips for dealing with lightning? I find rain annoying enough, but I always find myself leaving areas with lightning feeling like exploring there is discouraged.

Final question, I saw in hateno village a construction worker talking about an open house, can we buy it, and where would we find the guy that would let us?"
