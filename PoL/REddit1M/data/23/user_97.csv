46384,I need help with my last memory... I need to find the one that is clearly in or around the castle. I am in the library of the castle currently is there any way to get to the memory spot from actually inside the castle or do I have to re-scale the wall/perimeter? 
46848,"I haven't had too many issues with fight scenes but today I was exploring the castle and the steps never loaded, Link was just floating oddly 3 feet off the ""ground"" and it lasted for 2 rooms. Really odd and disorienting when it finally loaded the graphics. The lava in Goron also loads kinda choppy for me but I've never experienced a total game freeze. "
46976,Drat. I accidently climbed too far up last time and started the final boss fight (eek) so I had to load an auto save to escape. I'll have to figure out a good pathway over there.
