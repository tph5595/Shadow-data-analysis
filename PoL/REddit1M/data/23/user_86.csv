I know lightning in the wild can't hurt me, but can I still drop weapons, etc. when hit by lightning attacks? Is the damage the same with no resistance?"
41520,Gotcha. Really glad I took the time to explore and pick up some armor before going to more guardians. Lightning is a pain in the ass.

If you want to go for the memories, I used a guide but a couple take you right past a bunch of Guardians and one is in an especially intimidating area so maybe weigh your options there. If you don't want to use a guide, there's an NPC called Pikango who travels around stables and can tell you the general vicinity of where the memory pictures were taken."
