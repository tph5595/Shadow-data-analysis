13560,"Ok, so I am about 35 hours in and am taking it very slowly. Just recently did my first divine beast temple. Lots of exploring, done 20-something shrines, found 40-some korok seeds.

Where on earth is the big korok guy I can exchange seeds for inventory space with? I've only been to the area near Hateno, south in the beachy jungle area, and Lanayru for the Zora place."
