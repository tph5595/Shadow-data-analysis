35670,"I'm trying to enter the Akkala region and get to (akkala) tower, but everytime I cross the bridge,
1. I see these UFO like things that are flying around with searchlights (presumably guardians) --how do I deal with these?
2. freakin' lightning appears the moment I step on the bridge and I wasted all my fairies trying to cross it, only to die. (I even have the rubber pants, but it doesn't seem to help.)
Any advice on how to reach that tower? I've only completed vah Ruta so far"
