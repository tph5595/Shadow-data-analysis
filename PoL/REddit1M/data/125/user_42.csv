You never see guys wanting to play as Male Samus? Why can't we just leave them as they are? They are established characters with established genders. 

It's worse than historical revisionism. "

There is no female Mario. There is no male Samus. 

There is no female Link.


Thank god that Nintendo, being a japanese company, doesn't feel the need to bend to political revisionism of the highest and most obscene order. It's a matter of principle, and I for one am glad that Nintendo is going to stick to their guns on this for another 120 years. Hopefully by then people will stop the clamour for ruining beloved characters by changing their genders, instead of trying to put in effort into creating new, actual female characters like Aloy. It's a lazy copout and is disrespectful to players of all genders. "

If Nintendo creates a new action-adventure game with a real, developed, female protagonist, i'll be the first one in line. We do need more women to play in video games, but retconning established characters never should be the answer. It's a lazy copout that allows developers to ruin a character's identity in order to please a small subsection of fans in order to avoid putting in the time and conceptual effort needed to create a real female character with her own motivations, backstory, and personality. 

And *that* is why I sincerely hope that Link will never become female. "
