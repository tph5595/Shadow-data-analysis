20374,"True. This is why nintendo does this.

BUT, for those who want Link to actually confirm his love in a future game, I would say to them: There is hope.

Why? Because Nintendo wants the player to feel like Link. The player to make choices etc. Which is why Link is not talking. Nintendo doesnt want to put their words into your mouth. Like nintendo doesnt want to choose a girlfriend for you but leaves this choice up to you. BUT, this was the same thing with being able to name Link in previous games. They wanted you to name your character. But with Botw they took this big part of what makes the player the player and filled that in themselves. So I can see nintendo drawing more of the choices (perhaps the bigger choices) Link makes, for example picking a girlfriend like Zelda, away from the player in future Zelda games. "
42385,"Yes but my point is that nintendo is ready to give up on old traditions if they want to. If they need Zelda and Link to be in love in a future game for the sake of that games story they could just do it. 

Same with taking away the option of naming your char in Botw for the sake of VA/story telling. 

They are not bound to traditions anymore as we see with Botw. I like that. "

As we see with Botw Gameplay did outstanding. But when you ask the fans about the story, they will say something different. 

Take for example this very topic were posting in. 
And I believe Nintendo tries to improve where fans point out dissapointments. This is exactly what they have been doing with Botw. Listening to the fans. "

Appreciate your replies. "

But personally I dont see that happen. Extreem choices in the hands of the player. The reason for that is the story. I believe nintendo will not allow player choices to influence the course of the story."
