As you go along in the game you notice how quirky and goofy link is, the way he chuckles and laughs while shield surfing, how he blushes when people compliment him, his responses to people talking to him in side quests and the likes. He's pretty sassy too haha. But anyhow, that's how link has always been, particularly in this game. And honestly, I don't want thst to ever change. It wouldn't feel right if link was talking and acting like everyone else."

I think Nintendo basically slapped us in the face telling us that link and Zelda love each other deeply, at least in this game. I mean they spent all day every day wth each other, They went through horrible things and struggles together. How obvious could Nintendo get? I think this Zelda+Link is signed sealed and delivered."
47142,Exactly! Zelda games just has a magic that no other game has even come close to creating. Link is probably one of the most iconic main characters of all time due to his muteness yet cast personality.
50381,"I see your point, and honestly sometimes it did seem a bit awkward in a few of the cutscnes where link jus stood stiff, but again, there must be some reason for it as that's how every Zelda game ever has been. So idk haha I'm stumped"
52442,"I'm referring to him being mute lol. We could debate all day about the differences between each game and link and whatnot but I'm more saying in general, link has always been not as expressive."
65229,"True, one thing that botw didn't achieve as much I'll give you that. So basically what you're saying is link was a mannequin in cutscenes haha. I can definitely agree with that. Well I'm sure Nintendo will improve that in the future we will have to see. "
82815,I thought I saw a hug...
