It'll take it one step further if Nintendo wants the player to be immersed and invested and keep Link relatable since now you're putting yourself in his shoes. You can be a dick, or you can be flirtatious, or you can be serious, depending how Nintendo handles it if they go this route, the possibilities are endless."
