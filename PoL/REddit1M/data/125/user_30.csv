46733,I think you hit the nail on the head. SS was also a dialogue-heavy game (though not voice acted) and Link could still 'communicate' with the just expressions and body language. Link in BotW is about as expressive as concrete.
47174,"I'm not the guy you have been conversing with, but while I can't speak for everyone, the games that I look back the fondest upon and consider favourites years later are always the ones with stories or worlds that left lasting impacts on me, not the ones with the tightest gameplay. I've sunk over 250 hours each into TF2, Dota 2, and Payday 2, and while they were an absolute blast to play while I was into them , since I've stopped playing them as much they've fallen by the wayside and I definitely wouldn't call them favourites. Conversely, I know I've sunk less than 100 hours into either Deus Ex: HR or Wind Waker, and yet those are my two favourite games - not because they were fun to play at a gameplay level (they were, but not as much as some others) but because of the worlds and stories they create, the experience they take me on.

That's why, whenever people ask me what I think of BotW, I respond with ""It's the *best* Zelda *game*, but not my favourite entry in the franchise."""
47318,"&gt; the way he chuckles and laughs while shield surfing, how he blushes when people compliment him, his responses to people talking to him in side quests and the likes.

Right, but where are all of these in the cutscenes? Where are they when we're watching the moments that are supposed to be Link's driving motivation? Link is perfectly expressive in this game except when it most counts. I'll always remember this Link as the Link with the personality of concrete because in the moments that are supposed to have the most emotional impact he emotes the least."
47563,"&gt;People just don't know how to use their imagination anymore.

I can't use my imagination to imagine Link running to embrace Zelda at the end of the game when instead it's canon that he stands there like an expressionless tree. Link is perfectly expressive in this game except when it most counts. I'll always remember this Link as the Link with the personality of concrete because in the moments that are supposed to have the most emotional impact he emotes the least. OoT Link would at least widen his eyes and change the expression on his face, and since that point 3D Link has always been expressive (WW and SS particularly, TP less so)."
48024,"There's nothing wrong with a stoic type character, or one that generally doesn't express their emotions very much, but I don't think they did a good job of that in BotW. Adam Jensen, from Deus Ex, for example, is very un-emotive usually, but he has moments where they come through and reveal more of his character. Jotaro, from JoJo, is like this as well. Not that I'm suggesting Link should have the personality of either of these character (he shouldn't) but that stoic characters don't have to never emote, and in fact it's when they do that they reveal the most about their character. Link doesn't do this, ever, especially not during what are supposed to be the most emotional moments in the game."
49104,"You're right, investing in gameplay will always be the safest option, and it is important for games to have good gameplay to be enjoyable. However, to suggest that Nintendo shouldn't worry too much about the story because gameplay is a safer investment doesn't sit well with me, if only because I don't think always investing in the 'safest' option is really the right choice. Games that take risks and succeed are usually better than games that don't take risks.

But that aside, I would like to address the effect story can have on a game's experience. Take one of the games I mentioned previously, Human Revolution. The gameplay was pretty good, but definitely had some issues - playing slaughterhouse Jensen is borderline impossible, stealth is both easier and more rewarding. It's sequel, Mankind Divided, had much improved gameplay, and yet the game is generally seen as worse because its story is inferior to its predecessor. This is a case where devs investing in gameplay over story actively made the game worse.

I will admit that I'm very much in the camp of

&gt;some people don't mind subpar gameplay at all as long as the story is engaging.

Unless a game is actively frustrating to play, I can usually get through it if the story hooks me. That's not to say I don't like good gameplay, but that the games I do enjoy for their gameplay are the ones that double down on extra-challenging gameplay and reward high skill and time invested to git gud, like Dark Souls or DiRT. While BotW was a large step up from previous Zelda games in that direction, I still found the game disappointingly easy for all the hype it was getting as ""the hardest Zelda game yet"". Maybe my opinion will change once hard mode comes out, but as it stands BotW's gameplay is not enough to fix it in my mind as a personal favourite, and neither is its story."
49244,"""Link... do you remember me?""

""... Nope. No recollection at all.""

I mean I guess the reasoning is that if you go beat Ganon right off the great plateau Link really actually doesn't remember her, so they have to keep the game consistent for all options. The problem with that is it ruins the experience for anyone who doesn't do that (i.e. most players on their first run)."
50439,"&gt;that's how every Zelda game ever has been

Not really though. OoT Link would at least widen his eyes and change the expression on his face, and since that point 3D Link has always been expressive (WW and SS particularly, TP less so)."
53446,"&gt;link has always been not as expressive.

See I would refute that, WW and SS particularly Link is very expressive, just not with language. Their expressions and body language, though, tell you everything you need to know about what they're thinking, and as such they don't need to be voiced. They could never voice Link for the rest of the franchise and I would be perfectly happy, but as a character I think he need to be able to communicate somehow, and a precedent for that has already been set."
