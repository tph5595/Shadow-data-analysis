2968,"As I pointed out in other discussion, Nintendo has put much hints in this game through visual and music cues

Allow me just copy and paste my writing from another board:

-------------

Several NPCs made reference between Silent Princess and true love throughout the game, couple you could save on the road states the legend of Silent Princess would bring charmed life to loved ones if they found one; Bolson also mentions that flower petals mean endless love after the wedding quest; finally, the name Silent Princess came from a real world love story, I don't think the naming was purely coincidence. 

Whenever Zelda tried to pull a romantic move, there was always Silent Princess around her: when she took Link out for a ""first date"" she immediately found one; when she was talking to Deku Tree, there were several flowers around her; once Link defeated Ganon and they were reunited, the flower petals start blowing all over the sky in the post credit. Finally in the true ending, you saw Link and Zelda were literally surrounded by Silent Princess with their petals over the air, with the camera finally pan onto one as screen fades out.

I think it's silly how Nintendo put so much hints, but still avoiding direct expression. If they afraid to ""offend"" (which I think it's equally silly) some fans, they can also do options in dialogue or making it side quest like other games. 

For example, after defeating Ganon, as Zelda asks Link ""Do you really remember me?"" They could just let player choose between ""Kiss Zelda"" or ""Embrace her as a friend"".(like how you can choose in ending of Spirit Track) Then making them hold hands as they walked away in true ending if player choose to kiss her. Not that hard to please most of players, IMO."

39310,"If we read only Kass's line, sure, but after watching memory 18 and the true ending, it's hard for me not to think it's a romantic love.

Pretty sure Link knows too, Zelda wasn't trying to hide it at all 100 years ago: From completely cold to him to asking out to private dinners, took him to romantic stroll, confides her frustrations. Link has to be very naive to not know where this leads to..."
45730,"How would it be breaking the tradition when Zelda 2 ends with them kissing, and Zelink has been indicated in every game since Spirit Tracks?"
