44271,"Did you all notice this game is Japanese? And did you considered maybe it is a cultural thing? I don't know if it is a thing there, but I heard a lot of critique to American movies and TV about this obsession with creating romantics couples. Think any show or movie and you see a point where the male and female characters starts to look to each other in a romantic way. And almost every time is painful to watch because it's forced -- yesterday I was watching Iron First and all the suddenly the Colleen character starts to look to Danny as a romantic interested, even tho she didn't want to help him one episode before. 

So, my point is: Nintendo is doing what always do, making the game in a Japanese tradition. All the goofy scenes and the weird ones, all the sexual jokes... That's cultural. So, I don't think they will make Link and Zelda a couple. Not in the way we think. It will always be a repressed or subtle. And I thanks Nintendo for that. "
