Link has also never been a completely customizable character. If that were the case, there wouldn't be a Link. It would just be some random avatar you use in what should be Link's place.  
  
What they should do is make a different series of games with Linkle (but change her name) because she is actually a really interesting character."
75843,"The appearance of the characters have nothing to do with their position as a nintendo icon. Changing Zelda's appearence to be that of a male prince is just as easy as making Link a girl. In fact, it still urks me that people didn't realize that Sheik=Zelda. But does changing their gender do ANYTHING for the story? No it doesn't. So why change it at all? Changing the gender of Link will look like nothing more than a political move on the part of Nintendo. They have plenty of female characters that they could give us more insight to that would more than make up for the dissproportionate representation of females in Zelda's long history. Most of the ""make Link a girl"" talk comes from this problem. However, in recent games, females have taken more important roles. And I would love to play a game as Zelda, Impa, Midna, or many of the other females that exist within the Zelda universe. As other people have stated, Nintendo should focus on making other successful franchises that revolve around interesting female characters rather than trying to inject a female version of one of their most beloved characters into a story that's held firm for generations. "
76688,"The argument of Link being an ""avatar"" is missleading and a false interpretation of the entended character design of Link. Avatars in games refer to characters that are completely self identfied with the player. They aren't given concrete names or appearances. Take the Elder Scrolls games for example. You play as a ""hero"" that you name, customize, and level up all according to your design. That character has no default appearance (unlike Link) and has no established name (unlike Link). Every playable character in a story driven game is supposed to connect you to the game. You play as a character because you assume the role of that character. Playing Link is no different than playing Master Chief from Halo, Gordan Feeman from Half Life, or Chell from Portal. None of those characters speak much at all if not ever but they are there for the purpose of our immersion. That's what any successful main character is supposed to do. Link isn't some make your own hero on the character customization screen. He's an establish Nintendo rep that people (no matter that their gender is) can relate to. Changing his gender won't make him any more relatable than than he already is. "
77070,"If you need to change the gender of a character to make it relatable, the flaw is with the context of the character, not the character's appearence. Basing your identification off a characters sex is surface level thinking. Deep character's produce deep connections. If no female could identify with Link, than why are there millions of female fans who love Link just as much as the males? Its because Link is already an amazingly relatable character. "
77283,"Established sex for a character doesnt really matter. The real problem as stated in my other posts is that people cant relate to Link because he is male. That is bullshit logic. Are they also saying I can't relate to Zelda as well as I can Link because she is a female? No, if I cant relate to a character, it's because its a poorly designed character. Not some fault of their gender."
78359,"No, gender doesn't make a character more relatable. That's why games CAN have a options to chose different genders. It's because genders do not contribute anything to a characters emotions, personality, or backstory. You can fabricate any story and then apply it to both a male and female character just the same. The fact that you can't relate more to a character because of their gender speaks more toward your misunderstandings of character design than it does a problem with Link's character."
78960,"I would say its the primary reason. It relates to what you said about political revisionism. Why make Link a girl? What does it do for the story or his character? Nothing. Thats the answer. The only reason anyone would want to play a female Link over a male Link is because they DONT want to play a male Link. That's a stupid reason. Why not make two gender options for every well know character in history? Its a stupid arguement. If people believe they cant relate to the opposite sex, then they are stubborn, naive, and unwilling to look into the deeper constructions of a character beneath the outlying appearance. Good character make relatable characters. Not gender. Allowing players to chose the gender of Link would destroy the entire concept of his Link in an instant and establish shallow perceptions of his character."
79109,Well said. 100% agree. Give me new badass female character to play as. And also make another Metroid game while their at it. 
79396,"No problem. I agree with what you are saying. I just want to clarify your point with some concrete reasons rather than just saying ""X is male and Y is Female, deal with it."" It wasnt neccessarily wrong but there were just better ways of putting it. Your post also helped me gather my thoughts as well so thanks!"
79994,"No I understand your point entirely. I just think it's completely wrong. You think that a female Link would somehow be MORE than relatable than a male Link to you based on just a SINGLE change in his gender. That kind of logic is absolutely shallow. You think that Link will be a better character in your eyes if he was female. My question to you is why does his gender matter? What changes in your eyes make it more relatable? Because Link now has female features instead of male? What does changing his gender/appearance have ANYTHING to do with his ideals, personality, or motives? The answer is it doesn't. You just want to play as a female Link because want to. That reasoning is childish. Your inability to relate to a male Link compared to a female Link speaks to some personal bias of yours. The concept of Link does not change whether he is a male or female. The fact that anyone cant relate to a character based soley off gender is wrong."
83509,"Firstly, the more you try to explain your reasoning the more your argument falls away from the subject of gender altogether. Instead, now you are arguing that appearance is all that matters to you. The fact that you keep having to add in other variables to justify your position displays how weak your arguement was to begin with.  
  
As for the topic at hand, adding a feature to change Link's gender by a player is not a ""tiny"" change. With your kind of logic, why not give that option to every other character in the games you play? At what point does customizing a character start to change what the character's identity was meant to be? Once again, arguing that the aesthetics of a character somehow subconsciously make you identify with a character more is a shallow and ignorant way of thinking. Of course you understand things more that look like you. Everyone does that. But I have identified more with characters in games that look nothing like me compared to ones that do because of important things such as personilty, morals, ideals, and actions. Does that mean I'm wrong in doing that? Appearance is never supposed to be the deciding factor of ones character. It harkens back to the childhood phrase, ""Dont judge a book by its cover."" The fact that your opinion of relatability is swayed by their appearance is an injustice to the developer's intentions.  
  
Unlike many other companies, Nintendo produces games that are deeply and passionatly created by dedicated artists and story tellers. These are THEIR games for YOU to experience. Series like Zelda, Mario, Kirby, Smash Bros, Kid Icarus, Metroid, and many other franchises are made by creators that make the games THEY want. If you want to enjoy their games, respect the creators intentions behind their choices and character design. Zelda is not some entitlement for fans to customize that their own disclosure. It's not a make your own story. You are playing the story that someone else made. If you want to understand why Nintendo developers think this way, just go look up how much effort people like Masahiro Sakurai put into their games. They work themselves into poor health to create content and characters that express their passions and ideas. For you to say that you can't fully relate to Link because he doesn't look like how YOU want him to is disrespectful and shameful. If you don't like how Link looks, then don't play Zelda games. If we get more customization for Link, that will be great to. So just respect the game as it is instead of wanting to change it until it fufills the wishes of the unsatisfied minority."
