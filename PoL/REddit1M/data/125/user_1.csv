1756,"I think the reason they never ship it (or any other couple involving link, for that matter) is for the same reason they keep him mute. Easier to relate to. For instance in OoT, those that would ship Link + Malon would have been disappointed if Zelda was officially her gf."
41867,"&gt; They wanted you to name your character. But with Botw they took this big part of what makes the player the player and filled that in themselves.

That was done only so voiced characters' dialogue is guaranteed to be consistent with your name. It wouldn't make sense for them to call you Link if you named your character something else."
42194,"It would rarely affect anything lore-wise, but god knows that doesn't stop players from creating their own versions of the lore in the form of fan fiction.

Even if one didn't particularly care about who would be Link's gf, some people would assuredly dislike the fact that Nintendo shipped any couple just because it breaks tradition. And yes it makes sense to break traditions in some cases, but only when it affects gameplay, and that aspect of the games is absolutely not gameplay."
42935,"Like I said earlier, Nintendo is willing to break traditions when it affects the game experience. They cut the name choosing so VA would still make sense, as it would be pretty jarring otherwise. They changed the story structure to allow for both freedom in tackling the game and actually uncovering the story in the order you want through memories. They cut on the number of items/runes so each one could be ultra-polished and used in as many ways as possible. If they made a couple official though? I don't see it affecting gameplay. Spirit Tracks showed us Zelda doesn't need to be his gf to accompany you through the game, and SS showed us they don't need to ship it for us to actually want to find and save her so badly."
44498,"&gt; Well games are not only about Gameplay.

I think they kind of are, honestly. Even if you made a game that has terrible graphics, story, music, or what have you, it'll still be bearable if the gameplay holds up. The same can't be said for music and graphics, and only somewhat for story. A game with a great story but subpar gameplay will still be tedious to play.

But for the sake of the argument, let's say that you have a retail version of Spirit Tracks (where Zelda and Link are seen holding hands at the end) and a beta version of the game that is 100% the same except they just stand next to each other and don't hold hands. I don't know about you, but I'd consider both versions' stories to be of the exact same quality.

Really, Nintendo being family friendly will not ever make Link french kiss anyone. Even Peach's kiss, imo, is passable in the more cartoony Mario universe than it would be in TLoZ (not to mention that unless the Zelda is a child in a given game it would be link for Adult OoT Zelda or TP Zelda to kiss Link on the cheek vs french kiss, imo). So that hand holding at the end of Spirit Tracks is pretty much as far as Nintendo is probably going to go to maintain their family friendly image, yet nobody seems to remember they pretty much shipped that couple."
46393,"I dont know about Triforce Heroes, but this whole thread is about how there is no such indication in BotW. LBW has nothing of the sort either. The birds flying off in SS could be meant to be dymbolic of Link and Zelda committing to staying down in Hyrule therefore perpetuating the legend. And god knows Zelda 2 has as much to do with series tradition as BotW. So far we have a clear Zelink in Spirit Tracks and a hinted one in SS, that's it."
47963,"&gt; they were fun to play at a gameplay level (**they were**, but not as much as some others) but because of the worlds and stories they create

That's the important part. My point is that gameplay is the safest place you can invest energy in when making a game, and that shipping Zelink or whoever has 1) no bearing on gameplay and 2) doesn't bring anything particularly unique or interesting to the story, it would break tradition for the shock factor and nothing else.

You might be saying that those two games are favorites because of the story, but I don't think you'd keep that opinion if the gameplay was bad, even if the story was unchanged. For instance, I liked DA : Inquisition's story, but thought the gameplay was particularly boring, so it's nowhere near my list of favorites. Borderlands 2 had both a great story and great gameplay, so it's dear to me. The latest Monster Hunter (US-side at least) has pretty much no story but I love the gameplay, so it's high up in my favorites and I still have some memorable experiences from that series.

Of course, some people don't mind subpar gameplay at all as long as the story is engaging, much like others will skip all the cutscenes in a story-driven game just so they can get to playing more quickly, but I think those are outliers. I think most people are much more lenient on a game with good gameplay with a subpar story, but not vice-versa."
