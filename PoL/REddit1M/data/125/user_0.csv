0,"....wanted to have the Deku Tree tell Link something other than ""I love you?"" Her diary pretty much confirmed this is what she wanted to say...yet Nintendo failed to deliver and didn't have her actually say it in this game. (Zelda in SS wanted to tell link something before she got blown off her bird...never go to tell him onscreen) TWO GAMES IN A ROW NINTENDO!!!

I kinda wonder if Nintendo was trying to troll us into thinking thats what she wanted to say, yet they have something else intended in mind."

67132,Well they did the same thing in Skyward Sword... so either this is going to be a running thing or they will eventually say it. I'd rather they just say it and move on from there.

Its kinda hard to see whats happening. But as it zooms out you can see the dots move towards their horses instead of holding still."
