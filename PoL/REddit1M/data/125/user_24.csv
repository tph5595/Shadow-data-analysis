I wish they'd let you choose Link's gender and hair colour though. The only issue would be pre-rendered cutscenes needing two variations and as a result taking twice as much space, but it's doable."
56003,"I agree that Link's appearance shouldn't be *fully* customizable for the sake of keeping him a recognizable character whilst allowing the player to identify with him as much as possible. I think this game's clothing system strikes a good balance, by allowing you to change Link's appearance but still have a predefined person under the armour.

I stand by my opinion on the gender thing, though. Mario has a moustache, he's tubby but (Obviously) isn't busty, if he were turned into a woman it would completely change his appearance. It'd look like someone else in Mario's clothes.

I think Link is different though. Especially BotW Link, who's pretty androgynous as is. I wouldn't want anything too obvious, just something like what Yacht Club Games did with [Shovel Knight](http://yachtclubgames.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/shovelKnightWIP_concept-630x432.png). Besides the metal skirt in the armour, none of the changes are completely obvious (Especially not in-game) and it's pretty hard to tell unless you have them side by side. All I'd want is for Link to have a * very slightly* different body type, and a different but still similar face like that of Robin in Fire Emblem."
61053,"That *is* what I want, though I don't get the lenny face."
70985,"Splatoon lets you choose your character's gender, as well as its skin tone and eye colour. As well as its name, although that's a given seeing as it's an online multiplayer game. Can you really call it 'a game with a female lead' if it's up to the player?

Also, when Metroid was new most people who hadn't finished the game thought Samus was a man anyway. Her gender was a **plot twist**. Plus it's impossible to tell when she has her armour on. Link's gender, on the other hand, has nothing to do with the story of any of the games. And changing it wouldn't change him enough to be 'tarnishing a beloved character'.

It's not revisionist history, it's not even retconning. I'm not asking for a female Link, I'm asking for the choice to have a male or female Link. Link is and always has been an avatar for the player, the *link* between the real world and the game world. To me, anything that makes it easier for players to identify with him is a positive."
73344,"Look, it seems like neither of us is going to change their views. We should probably just end the conversation here.

If there ever comes a time where Nintendo lets you choose Link's gender, you can pick male and I can pick female. If not, you can wear the default outfit and I'll just get Link to cross-dress. He's been doing it for two games in a row."
76344,"I'm not in favour of making Link a woman by default. What I want is nothing more than the option, not because it would appease some pretentious Huffington Post writer or because it would make someone who wouldn't have bought the game otherwise buy it (I know it wouldn't) but because it could make the player character just a little bit more identifiable to some players."
77737,"I'm not saying that it being of a different gender makes the character not relatable, I'm saying that giving you that choice would make it *more* relatable."
79195,Am I explaining myself wrong? I don't think we're fully understanding each other's points.
81072,"See, that's what I was talking about in my previous comment. There's nuance to my opinion that you're not seeing, which probably means there's nuance to yours that I'm not seeing either.

It's not that Link would be a better character to me based solely on his gender, as you said gender has absolutely no impact on the story of Zelda games. I can relate with a character whose gender is different from mine, but on a purely aesthetic and superficial level it makes the character more identifiable. It's like getting a haircut in Animal Crossing, (I'm not implying any similarities between the two games beyond the ones I make explicit, please don't assume that I am.) it really has no significant impact within the game, but the fact that your character look a little more like you helps a little with the immersion. (Again, before you misunderstand my opinion, I'm not saying it can make or break immersion or even that it has a significant role. It's a tiny thing that can subtly *add to* a game with good immersion if that immersion already there.)

**I can relate to a character who's of a different gender, ethnicity, cultural background, or any label, that's obvious. But giving you more aesthetic choices enhances your connection to the character, even if it's just a superficial one. At least it does that for me, though I guess you don't feel that way and there's probably lots of people that are in the middle.**"
