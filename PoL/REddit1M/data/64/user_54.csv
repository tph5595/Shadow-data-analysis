19483,"I'm as pumped as anyone about this game and the new physics engine, but did it bother anyone else that he could propel his sailboat using the leaf while standing on the boat itself?"
149068,"Um, no it's not. Basic conservation of momentum means that any force generated by the leaf would be equal or greater than any force imparted on the sail. In other words, he might as well get rid of sail, turn around, and use the leaf the other way."
149252,"&gt; No doubt they'd go a lot faster with the fan going backwards, and no sail.

They also say this is seemly in opposition to Newtonian physics, which was my point.

Anyway, interesting video at least."
169621,"I didn't want this to turn into a physics lesson but here it is anyway.

The only reason those ""work"" is because the air being blown out of the fan is being redirected by the sail backwards. For instance, imagine a fan facing forward into a u-shaped tube which redirects the air backwards."
169713,"Of course, and it won't make me hesitate for a moment from getting it and enjoying it."
169844,The only reason this works is because the air is being redirected. Similar to if you had a fan facing forwards blowing into a u-shaped tube which redirected all the air backwards. Newton's Laws still apply.
170040,"So just like it makes no sense to not just turn the fan around and use it that way, it makes no sense that you wouldn't be able to just turn Link around and blow backwards with the leaf and forget about the sail entirely."
210213,"In the game it clearly works and is effective. What's more, I'd be willing to bet that in the game, if you turn around and push air with leaf backwards, nothing happens.

Also the fact that it ""works"" is basically a rounding error as far the energy involved is concerned. It's like seeing a vibrating phone move across the table and then claiming that cars could just vibrate a lot to move down the road instead of having wheels."
