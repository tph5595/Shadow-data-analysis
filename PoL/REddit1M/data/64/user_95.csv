46132,Majora's Mask pull this off much better than Souls does though.
127953,"&gt; MM's lore is almost entirely player inference.

And in this way how is it any lesser than Dark Souls? It goes out of its way to provides meticulously thought out backstories, histories and relationships for each of the characters through various methods, some of which are much less obvious than others. 

Souls deals with the history and past of people who are tangentially related to what is going in the present and mostly informs you of this through item descriptions and such, but it's exactly this over reliance on items to inform you that I consider a comparative weakness. You can piece together much from this, but MM provides you the information in a variety of creative and natural ways that are more connected to the present via the possible actions and interactions the NPCs can take. Even silly stuff like the underwear fungus has that much attention to detail payed to it."
212384,"&gt;When I refer to lore in MM I'm referring to the inferred lore revolving around angering the goddesses.

No, that's complete bullshit and I was afraid you were talking about that. No, the Goddesses were not angered by penis statues, I'm sorry.

&gt;unimportant side character stories?

The side stories are important, and are exactly what I hold up as a superior example of inferred storytelling compared to Dark Souls."
263567,"The fate of the Deku Butler's son is not ""blatantly told to the player"". Nor is Cremia's past with Kafei, or Mikau and Lulu's relationship. All this stuff relies on the player discovering the dialog and environmental ques themselves and piecing together it all to understand the characters, their pasts and how they relate to one another. You can try following Anju around for the whole three days in various circumstances in order to see what she does in various conditions. This alone is at least as compelling as any storytelling Dark Souls pulls off. Even the jugglers have more personality than most NPCs in most games."
290291,"&gt;  As for Kafei and Anju?

I never said anything about this couple in particular, read what I wrote again.

&gt;In the strictest sense you could consider it lore of the game overall, but in the game's setting it wouldn't be.

I agree, but I'm less talking about lore, in the sense of something that necessarily happened long ago, and more about understanding the history of things leading up to the present moment and storytelling techniques that can be used to inform you of this. In this regard MM is more powerful because it deals in things that are more recent.

As an example of a point where this is done well in Dark Souls, I'l give the example of tricking you into thinking that the Chaos Witches are outright evil and that their servants are all slaves who are being unwillingly tortured."
389508,"It doesn't, that's my point. It tricks you into thinking that by setting everything up so that it looks like this is the case at first, making you hesitant to trust them, which might influence the decisions you make in that area. You encounter Quelaag, who attacks you, you see the servants backs, probably attack them and release maggots, then later realize that they are feeding on living human bodies. Without discovering further information, a player exploring without a guide will likely naturally assume this, only understanding the actual lore later, if at all. This is good environmental storytelling.

A significant majority of players will, likewise not realize the identity of the stump at the start of Majora's Mask unless all the elements demonstrating it are pointed out to the player, since many people won't recall the butler's dialog unless they specifically replay that section."
