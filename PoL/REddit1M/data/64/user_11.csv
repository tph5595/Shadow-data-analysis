6181,"Not very different from most other trailers for the 3D zelda games tho...  
Only TP really shows off any of the ""village characters""

Even MM, which clearly has the biggest focus on a town and its characters doesn't actually show the town off decently.  

.

They show the major focus of the games in the trailers.  
For this game, that's the wilderness and the physics stuff"
6268,Personally I'm glad they are going with the much more enjoyable path of focussing on the gameplay part of the engine over the visual part of how everything looks and how shiny everything is.
9682,"We simply haven't seen them yet.  
chill.  

Almost all major footage has either been : ""look at this pretty or awe-inspiring nature"" or clips from the plateau, which has a story reason to not have npcs"
10503,"We have only gotten 2 actual trailers so far.  
And even then, this new on is just a re-cut of the first one and some footag they have released since. 
So lik 1.5 at most.  


(also the VERY FIRST trailer did show npcs albeit unceremoniously in the background) "

the PLATEAU **SPECIFICALLY** has that reason.

but yeah, i accidentally removed ""and SS"" from the second sentence"
