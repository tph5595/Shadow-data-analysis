21070,I'm hoping for somewhere between regular Zelda and Dark Souls. I think it would be cool to figure out a bit of the lore from set pieces.
21220,"Calamity Ganon is referred to as more of a cataclysmic event than as an entity from what we have seen, iirc it was being referred to not as a person or conscious being. It may be more like a mindless concentration of darkness or malice than actually being the big guy himself."
85077,"To be fair we have next to nothing in MM to go on, though. MM's lore is almost entirely player inference. Dark Souls builds upon their item description lore not only with the environment but with where items and objects can be located."
148811,"Are we talking about actual lore, or just unimportant side character stories?

When I refer to lore in MM I'm referring to the inferred lore revolving around angering the goddesses."
261370,"The sidestories aren't inferred at all, what? Those are blatantly told to the player.

What's a single sidestory that is told solely through the environment or items?"
267548,"It's so obviously insinuated that the butler's son is the mask spirit that literally children can understand it. As for Kafei and Anju? It's still blatantly told to you when you pursue the quest, it's not being hidden from you or requires the player to assume anything, which is what Dark Souls does heavily. Most of the Souls lore is only hinted at and the players are left to piece together what they can to make the most logical conclusions.

I also wouldn't so much consider Anju and Kafei's inconsequential questline as really being lore, more like just character backstory. In the strictest sense you could consider it lore of the game overall, but in the game's setting it wouldn't be. The story of the giants, the story of the goddesses, the story of the Hero of Time, all of these would be lore in the game's setting.

Just like how you wouldn't consider the player as killing Patches in Dark Souls as being a part of the setting's lore as it had just happened and is also fully dependent on player action, but the entirety of the story revolving around how Lordran and its Lords fell into this sorry state would be."
344489,When does the game ever state the Chaos Witches are evil or that their servants are slaves?
