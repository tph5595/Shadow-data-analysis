24701,"Although I'm more of a Pokemon fan, the advertising for BoTW has been leagues above Sun and Moon. Game Freak has revealed something like three quarters of the new Pokedex which is dumb. And plenty plot-related details have been mentioned as well, leading to less discovery as the game is played I think. I wish they had held back a little more (okay, a lot more)."
