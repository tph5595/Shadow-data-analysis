319198,"Haven't played fable, however, I kind of like how there is little to no spoken dialogue. 

I think it's because the audio team still produces unique sfx to convey all (or most) character emotions and reactions within dialogue and events. This seems to lend itself nicely to the always epic and beautiful soundtrack - making those often more quiet moments of dialogue and cutscenes in the story have greater effect and impact, and become nostalgic.

I think adding in voice acting would do more harm than good. This simple bit of noice reduction helps make the experience a bit more immersive and imaginative/personal. 

That's my opinion, of course. Maybe ill give fable a try some time and change my mind!"
