That's why we need footage of a town or something. Everything we've seen seems to ""have a story reason to not have NPCs"". We need reassurance that there will be something besides few-and-far-between hermit NPCs in a barren wilderness world. Because the developers have a ""story reason"" to not even include that sort of thing, we just want reassurance that they're not going to take the easy out and forgo this feature."
