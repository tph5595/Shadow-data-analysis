37203,Looks amazing but the frame rates are beginning to concern me.  Even just jumping into the water there is an obvious drop in frames both times.
40719,after every sword hit on an enemy it seems to freeze as well.  This is more likely a design choice but its possible they did it to mitigate a possible frame drop.  Either way i would prefer if the combat was smooth and did not have that freeze for a split second.
51076,I get the idea behind it but i would prefer if it was smooth and fluid.  Just my opinion.
