63059,"I am a bit worried how far from a traditional Zelda game this may be.  I like open world games like gta v, assassin's creed, etc..but hate games like oblivion. 

This game has the feel of an oblivion type own world where it gives you no direction and just wander from point to point doing whatever...

I really hope it is not just a big, empty,  directionless, lifeless world..."
