56350,"Nintendo revealed the large majority of Skyward Sword before release, too. I'm afraid to even watch this trailer and I refused to watch that 7 hour gameplay demo at E3. I learned my lesson."
56480,"So was I right to avoid that? Skyward Sword showed off 90% of the game before release and I've sworn off looking at anything besides trailers. Hell, I'm afraid to even look at THIS trailer just in case. I don't trust Nintendo not to spoil the experience."
56534,What's in this trailer? I've not been keeping up because Skyward Sword's pre-release material showed off every single dungeon other than the final dungeon.
58330,"Was there a dungeon shown off at all? Or any puzzles? Is it true what they say about it being like NES Zelda where you can just stumble upon a dungeon? Or maybe I dreamed that they said that. I'm very skeptical when people say there's no more hand-holding, Fi scarred me too much to believe that."
64817,"I decided to watch it because hey it's just a 2 minute trailer instead of the 7 hour E3 demo - and yeah, this is a nice teaser instead of what Nintendo used to do, showing off the whole fucking game.

What do you mean showing off the villain, though?"
