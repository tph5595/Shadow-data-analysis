75419,"This trailer is not for the long-time fans that have kept watch on this since the start, it's meant for a wider audience, including the many, many people who didn't even know there was a new Zelda game coming up.

The excitement of a trailer like this to more hardcore fans isn't ""Look at all the new stuff!"" it's ""They're far enough along to make a trailer!"" It's knowing that we're one step closer to actually getting the game."
