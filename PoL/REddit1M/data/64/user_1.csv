I want a slight sense of what's happening before I go in. But then again, the mystery behind it all and the need to discover is at an all time high and I love it. It's gonna be a really tough wait!"
20855,"I highly doubt there would be a Zelda game with Ganon being the villain and then have him be the second in command (like Ghirahim, Zant, or Chancellor Cole), especially if you consider that the majority of Zelda games have had Ganon(dorf), his alter-ego, his ancestor, his reincarnation, or something similar be the main villain. I know they're mixing up the formula, but it's still called The Legend of Zelda, with Link as the protag, so who's to say that Ganon won't be the antagonist."

67902,It does sound a lot like Mononoke Hime. After Skyward Sword Nintendo really picked it up with music - I think there are high hopes for this one with the Hisaishi vibe for sure.
