Maybe it's to make you more like Link - they want you to start the game dumb to what's ahead of you. Maybe they just want to mete out information slowly and carefully because so much is riding on the success of this game, so they can stoke the hype fire to burn as bright as possible at launch. 

But the map is huge. Just fucking huge. If there's not at least a town, let alone multiple, with that kind of square mileage....fuck, I'll be pissed. I like the post apocalyptic feel but there's gotta be people to talk to."
