6459,"You do realize that everything in the trailer in this thread is gameplay whereas your link is a tech demo high quality rendering that in no way can be done with the WiiU's hardware limitations for a full game, right?

Also IMO the graphics in your video look like updated Twilight Princess graphics with a lot more texture and lighting. The video you showed is more of the same Zelda formula. I'm glad they're switching it up with what we've seen with BotW. "
