Speedrun testers used hacks to see what happens if you teleport out of the plateau without paraglider, and you can actually make it through all boss fights no problem. However when you spawn outside for the final fight, you are in hyrule field and the killzone activates, sending you back to plateau.

Plateau is a great first playthrough mechanic, but it does kinda suck for second playthrough and speedruns. In any% the plateau takes up half of the run. The other half is just boss rush. Its pretty boring."
