9602,It's for this reason that you can make a strong argument for the great plateau being the best part of the game. 
40764,"It has a different feel sure, but your answer is a little extreme. I'm still surprised the downvotes. 

What I like about the Plateau tutorial: resource management and survival matters. To get through the cold part you really do need to choose between pursuing the tunic or learning how cook hot food. Getting creative with enemy encounters (pushing a boulder down a hill) serves a real purpose (saving your weapons) that is absent later on. I'm not overpowered and really have to think about my plan of attack. Each shrine teaches me a fundamental part of the game using simple logic and problem-solving as opposed to direct hand holding, and none of them are really that long. 

It is setting me up for success and giving me a chance to slow down and take my time so I don't completely fling myself into the rest of the world. Yes it requires patience. If you go into botw with the attitude of ""I want to do everything and I want to do it NOW"" then you're missing the point of the plateau and you're forcing yourself to not enjoy what it is there for.
