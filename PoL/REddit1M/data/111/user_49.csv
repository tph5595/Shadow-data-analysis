41885,"You can use it three times before it has to recharge. But you get a heck of a boost out of using it, and the updrafts created by it stick around for a short time, so chances are that when you use it, whatever you used it for will be successful. You shouldn't have to worry about having to use it repeatedly in one encounter and running out of it quickly. And it recharges quickly enough once it's out that you can get away with using it ""just to not have to climb that"" or to shorten an especially long climb that you might have been able to climb without it. It doesn't remove the need for stamina-boosting consumables, but it can make them last longer by occasionally removing the need to take them."
