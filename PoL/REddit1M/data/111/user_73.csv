60352,"I'm 2 Divine Beasts in with tons of side quests/exploration and I'm absolutely loving BOTW, but I do regret this. Not the paraglider per say - because that's a lot of fun - but the huge drop off of lateral thinking, macguyverish puzzles like this after the plateau. I LIKE getting stronger and stronger and more mobile as games go on, but I sorta feel like BOTW shoots its load way too early.

That feeling of discovering a new, resourceful way to do something (like cutting down a log bridge, or rolling a boulder into a bokoblin camp) just doesn't really happen again, and everything becomes a pretty familiar pattern. The plateau should have been just a small appetizer for a huge amount of open-world problem solving. Instead it's the most challenging part of the game.

I also regret getting all the runes at the beginning. I understand from the nonlinear game design POV why they did this, but it steals that signature feeling from the original zeldas of *earning* thrilling new abilities deep into the game, in the hidden cellars of forbidden dungeons. Abilities that you've been dying for, that unlock genuinely new experiences/fun. I don't love the style of just being handed those abilities as soon as you enter easy shrines made just for you.

I think the idea of BOTW being a throwback to the original Zelda was maybe a tad oversold, and I really wanted it to be true to a degree it wasn't. The truth is it totally does contain some hand-holding and sign-posting and some choices that feel a bit dumbed down. Almost all of the puzzles are told to you by someone in the game, or trained into you explicitly. This is no doubt top 2-3 Zeldas ever made, it's soooo close to being absolutely perfect. I hope they double down on the original Zelda hands-off approach, and make the next one even more of a consistent sense of lateral-thinking discovery."

In the snowy region, seeing the ""wood cutter"" axe stuck in the tree was more than enough enough to trigger that ""what if...."" thought in my head and try it out. Any player would sooner or later hit a tree with a weapon and get that ""ah ha!"" feeling. It didn't need so many hints. I feel this way with a lot of the puzzles. It's a DRASTIC shift in the right direction, from the last 20 years of super hand-holding games, but it still could be even more hands-off without being unfair. And the those feelings of discovery would be that much better. Here's hoping for the next one..."

65689,"I mean, ok. At a certain point you're just not picking up on what's there. I don't know if you can blame the game designers for every time some individual is just not seeing what's there. I'm surprised you were able to wander through the Lost Woods. I saw the solution almost immediately, and it kinda surprises me that anyone wouldn't. So I thought it should have been harder, but in your case it's good that you were still able to make it I suppose. The torches started you off on a ramp, and it left you alone. There's nothing wrong with that logic, you just didn't see it at first. I WISH I got genuinely lost and frustrated. What I can't agree with is this idea that all game design should cater to the lowest common denominator. Adventure games should be smart and challenge people, and if some gamers aren't clever enough then they don't pass."
