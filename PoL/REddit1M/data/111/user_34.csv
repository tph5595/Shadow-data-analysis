To add to what I said, I enjoyed my time to begin with on The Great Plateau. But, I still thought it was a mistake to trap you there until you completed some tutorials. That's Old Zelda, not this New Zelda. 

What should have happened (say, if they make a sequel in this style) is that you should have had all your runes and the glider from the start, but the Old Man would have recommended to visit the various tutorial trials first, to quickly learn how to use your Sheikah Slate. That way, the player can choose whether they want to go through an introductory course or go straight into the action (Gears Of War 2 did a simple, effective version of this through a simple go left or go right decision at the start of the game)."
