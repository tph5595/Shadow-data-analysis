and that is extremely hard to do in an open world game... I honestly can't remember an open world game without the intrusive tutorial cutscenes and quests.

Nintendo really is a master of doing this, and I'm glad they are back at it... Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword were particularly bad with tutorials and hand-holding."
