I don't worship the game. But I do wish many more learn from it. I doubt it'll happen but hey. I can dream.

Speaking of which would even be considered ""Worship""

Do you love a game and start praising it for everything it does? Would that fall under that category.

Or being impressed by what it does where you wish other games follow in its steps? It seems when a popular series is praised for doing something good. people just label the praise as ""Worshiping.""

However, if they bring back such a mechanic it needs a nerf. Couldn't bring myself to turn off Mipha though. Her ""It is my pleasure."" Line resonated with me for some reason."

And sure. Generally everything has been done already in the gaming industry. What HASN'T been done already?

But lately all console games are just lacking, overpriced movies. "
152660,Go ahead then. I'd love to hear them.
157105,"Ah. I see your argument for BoTW. Most are mainly story. However The Horizon and Skyrim section is more for gameplay. 

I will say that BoTW's Overall story did need work. Especially since even the side quest's stories weren't too great either. So sure, BoTW could learn on the story aspect. But in gameplay I feel it crushes the other games rather heavily. 

Granted it doesn't have some features, you can see why but logically it's not an excuse. However these games did not do them anywhere near the best. 

Even if BotW doesn't have them the gameplay is still fun enough that the game can hold out without these features. I say the feeling of exploration in BotW is it's own thing. Even if Skyrim started it. I don't feel the versatility that is in BoTW in Skyrim.

Fallout is not something I can compare very easily. That game series is its own thing. I ended up playing BoTW much like how I play FO (Very good thing if you ask me.) But I can't see many similarities to them. Well. New Vegas in particular. Because 3 and 4 were just garbage.

Also these games did not start such features. They expanded upon them. It's subjective to how well you feel they do. But here's what I see. 

&gt; Skyrim pretty well set the bar for how Open World games play. They created a living world, with characters rooted in their own routines

* Majora's Mask (2000). Everything felt alive in that game (At the time.) In fact. The game pretty much as what both Witcher and Skyrim expanded on. MM had some very fun gameplay too. And personally Skyrim was rather clunky to me. And Witcher? Ha. Fun is not something that game is to me.

&gt; FFXV did an amazing job creating a reactive cast. Each main character is well crafted and responds appropriately to all manner of stimuli, from battle performance to how long they've gone without sleep or a bath.

* Xenoblade Chronicles (2011) did what FFXV did as well. Not as expanded but it was there first, characters reacted to battle and post battle. This carried over to X with a few additions.

&gt; battle system where different parts of your enemies have different weaknesses, can disable different abilities and can be leveraged against other enemies. 

* Xenoblade Chronicles X (2015) did what Horizon did. Literally the same thing just not as flashy or obvious. But it was in the gameplay.


So. On a story aspect. Fine. BoTW can learn. But on a gameplay aspect from how the game teaches you to how you play it and how it progresses. To how the mechanics work (And what they could add on in a sequel.) I feel other Open-World games can do far better. "
220151,"&gt; I haven't played Chronicles, but I have played Chronicles X, and while they're certainly the same idea, they're nowhere near comparable in execution. You may as well suggest Baldur's Gate did it first by having characters react to critical hits, other characters dying, and being near death themselves. Yes, there's some overlap, but for the most part they are not the same system, not by a long shot.
Did you actually play Horizon or FFXV?

No I did not. I have seen videos and have heard from my friends who have.  I've been told FFXV combat is near identical to Xenoblade X by the Reddit and my friends who have played it. So aside from story, it's really a clone of said game. But less fun. And and the video shows It looks more of a chore than Xenoblade could be if you started grinding. But for the entire game.


As for the system. it's still the same concept at heart. Reacting to the situation and battle and basically the world. They do not react to the world in the Xeno games. However, the main comparison is reacting to what is happening. You said it right, lightly tapped in Xeno, but thoroughly expanded in FF. It makes little difference as it doesn't exactly change anything. It's still a character/development thing. And FF doesn't exactly make it better since they follow anime tropes to hell and back. 

&gt;  BotW excels in what it allows you to do in the sandbox, insofar as how many of the systems' physics overlap, but it's so damn inconsistent with not only its physics, but nearly every implementation of every system in the game, that if anything other games should take a wide breadth. BotW still has a ton of learning to do when it comes to that. 

Inconsistent how? Every single mechanic works properly and in conjunction rather well. There are some that could be improved upon on their own. But when melded together it works to the players favor very well.

Too well at times.

&gt; As for ""how the game teaches you to play,"" it doesn't. For some, that's the beauty of it, and it does lead to players experimenting to find out how to play. But the rest of it is trial by fire, and that's somewhat less fun than knowing how the system works baseline and gaining new intricacies. 

However it does. The game locks you in and you should learn all mechanics in the Plateau. Not master, but learn. And at that point some areas are still going to be tougher for someone with no gear. Fallout: New Vegas comes to mind. You in the same sense CAN go anywhere. But you take a left from Goodsprings with only starting level gear? 

See you in hell then. Those Deathclaws will rip you apart. It's not impossible though. Get better and better gear, level up, and there's your progression. A similiar sense is not only shown but vaguely explained. (Just like FO:NV) And that's one reason BoTW is fun. 


&gt; With each of these games I've played, I've been excited for the future of the genre should their competitors incorporate each game's successes into their own endeavor.

Opposite for me. It makes me lose faith in the genre because if someone does great, guess what? The others will follow with usually under sub-par games. CoughUbisoftCough.

So the fact that a company that has pretty much only done this genre once before (Xenoblade Chronicles X) Is both good and impressive especially since the game is what many lack.

Fun.

Because of this I very slightly hope that companies look at their quality before throwing out a game now. 

And I like Open-World games, I like the survival and exploration aspect. but BoTW makes it rewarding. I can only think of three such games that deserve praise in that regards. Now 4 with BotW.


&gt; all I can think of are how many systems need polish 

This to me is a great thing. So that means the next type of game like this will be even better than what it is now. Learn from their mistakes which is also good. Something Nintendo, for the most part, are good at."
