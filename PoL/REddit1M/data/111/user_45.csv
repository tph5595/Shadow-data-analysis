33992,"Same. Don't feel like I missed much by doing that. 

It is kind of a shame that the game has these cool little tricks that never come up again. "
34054,Are your friends rich? I can't imagine why a non-gamer would spend &gt;Â£300 on a console to play one game. Sounds very silly to me. 
34200,"I mostly agree, except there are a few key things the tutorial doesn't teach you. How to cook being the main one. I might have worked it out on my own eventually, but as it is I had to get someone to show me how to do it.

Also I don't think it ever tells you that you can crouch. I only worked that out later when I ducked to get under a building. It's weird that the loading screens tell you about the shield riding thing, which is cool but not very useful, and don't tell you about sneaking. "
42004,I completely missed that.
