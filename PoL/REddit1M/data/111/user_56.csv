44010,"Yeah, it's because of the level of freedom you have that I think it's a good idea.  Fencing you in a bit lets the plateau be arguably one of the freer parts of the game.  No one is shouting at you exactly what to do, you learn by exploring and screwing around, and there is a LOT to explore and figure out, especially for the first time, even on the plateau. I appreciated having free reign over my tiny domain and feeling some sense of mastery before being set loose on the world with an idea of where I ought to go. I think the world would have been overwhelming (and depending on where I went, lethal and disheartening) without that opportunity to build up the skills to match my excitement to explore. Plus, nothing there is actually intensive; if you know what you're doing then 2nd+ playthrough it takes no time to get through. "
