0,"I've never played a game before. 

I have acquired an axe from a camp on my way to find the shrines in the opening area. 

I go and see the old man chopping down a tree.  From this point I can make the logical connection

""Hey I can chop down trees!""

Now maybe I'm really stupid and don't realize that. The game even covers that scenario where you can (entirely optionally the guy doesn't come up to you and say ""WE NEED THIS TREE DOWN STAT HURRY"") talk to him ask ""What are you doing?"" And then he'll tell you about fucking chopping down trees and ask for your help. So you chop down the tree and now you got some wood and he says thanks and goes on his way.

But right next to him is 3 more trees (it's important there are 3 of them so you can practice if you fuck one up) next to a cliff with a tree on the other side and **WITHOUT ANY HELP FROM THE GAME** you make the logical connection ""I can chop down this tree and cross this gap"" And *even if you fuck up* you can still try 2 more times!

Every part of the tutorial is like this it is literally perfect. It caters to every single player imaginable showing exactly what you need to do but letting you make the connections in your head.

I'm not adding anything else someone else hasn't said most likely but I feel like I should point it out and wanted to get it off my chest.

They're not giving you a tutorial by shoving it down your throat. You discover it yourself. Remember that video about the opening level of Mario and the Mushroom? It's like that x1000. "
