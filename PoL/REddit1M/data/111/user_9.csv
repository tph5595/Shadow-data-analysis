The only quest marker the entire time leads you to activate a tower that gives you a great view of the whole plateau. The old man tells you to find four shrines, but with your *own freaking eyes* instead of giving you three quest markers. You can see all of them and figure out your travel plan on your own, *just like the main game* but on a smaller scale. Along the way you'll see the old man pop up who will teach you about mechanics like cooking and tree chopping if you want to have him teach you. Otherwise you're free to explore without any hand-holding and it all just clicks. The lack of the paraglider also makes you become more intimate with the climbing system and teaches you that all that land is worth trekking through instead of flying over it by forcing you see what's around the corner yourself. It really is the finest tutorial I've ever played."

104133,"The shrine quests are usually very on the nose clues as to where you should go. Like ""go to the giant tree on top of the mountain (camera shows it) and then do (something from a riddle)"". Or else it's very feasible to figure where to go. For example, you can just follow the guy who gives a shrine riddle at Hateno Fort right to where the puzzle is. How many quests have you actually gotten that only specify a region and nothing else? "
