97264,"This brings up such a great point. 

I always used guides on past Zelda games, because I felt insecure once the training ended and the game started that I would miss something really important. 

Because breath of the wild doesn't hold your hand, I never used a guide. It encourages you to really think but doesn't punish you for missing things. 

Most guides would say something like, get X item now or wait until end game to get it again, if  even then. 

In breath of the wild, if you miss something, you can go back literally anytime and get it, you don't have to divert from your own goals. It's great knowing that I can ignore a shrine quest that sounds too difficult until I am in a better frame of mind to solve it"
