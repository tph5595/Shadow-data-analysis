The whole ""Beat 4 shrines to get the paraglider"" thing is A) to stop you from falling to your death immediately after jumping off the great plateau B) IF you do make it to the ground safely, to demonstrate why making a beeline straight for hyrule castle will reduce to a flaming pile of blood, bones, and flesh, and C) In the event this is the first Zelda you've played since OOT, teach you this game will be almost nothing like what you remember.

You're not restricted, there ARE ways to make it down safely, but the game world grows to merely 18 times its size.

21738,"Perhaps my favorite part is after getting the glider, you don't HAVE to do this, but let's count how many mechanics you passively come across on the way to kakariko.

Goddess statues, possibly the depth of korok puzzles, WHY fast travel is a good thing, possibly the stone talus, safe landings, using your map, swimming, climbing towers, towers give you maps, advanced bokoblin camps, sheikah sensor revealing some shrines may be in a blind spot, new uses for your runes, stables, the blood moon, hestu and inventory expansion, side quests, shrine quests, each town has a shrine for convenience, rupees and selling stuff/buying stuff, inns, cooking/eating,  new climbing tricks, advanced combat, HOLY HELL!!!

Then if you go even further to Hateno: capturing/registering horses, navigating wide open fields, navigating fields of bokoblins and ""dead"" guardians, going off the road to find stuff, dye shops, armor, camera app, hyrule compendium, memories, ALLL WITHOUT FORCING YOU THROUGH A TUTORIAL!!!!"

Thought we were just gonna shit on things day in and day out on the internet? F*** no. This is WHY THE LEGEND OF ZELDA BREATH OF THE WILD IS SO ****ING GOOD IT MAKES MY DICK ROCK HARD!!!"

55776,It's not often a game is speedrun-proof. Can't tell if that's more impressive on the designers or the speedrunners.
