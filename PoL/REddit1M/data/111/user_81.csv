100230,"&gt;I've never played a game before.

Then how can you make a superlative declaration?

&gt; And even if you fuck up you can still try 2 more times!

Wait until you get to puzzles that rely on weapon durability and Stasis.



&gt;Every part of the tutorial is like this it is literally perfect. 

Five minutes in, I was amazed at what I could light on fire. Six minutes in, I was disappointed at what, arbitrarily, I could not.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Tall grass? Flammable.  
Bundle of Wood? Flammable.  
Arrows? Flammable.  
Fruit and Meat? Flammable.  
Korok Leaves and Tree Branches? Flammable.  
Enemies? Flammable.  
Self? Flammable.  
Trees you chop down? Flammable.  
Trees you haven't yet chopped down? Not flammable.  
Logs just sitting there? Not flammable.  
&amp;nbsp;  
Only gets more disappointing from there. You'll find things that work that make sense that lead to things that *should* work that don't, like shooting metal plates with lightning to electrify enemies, cooking frozen food to defrost it, freezing water cascading down a mountain that isn't a waterfall, swimming up a waterfall whose source is an underground spring, or bringing mountable items to the stable to keep them. Good luck thinking picking up an oar is an intuitive way to row a boat.

Then you'll get things that don't make sense but work that way arbitrarily. Lightning hits you like a fucking magnet if you're wielding a wooden bow *tipped* with metal, but stand around in Hylian Armor and you're fine. Doesn't matter if you stand in a field, near a tower, under a tree. Try to move an inch in the rain and you may as well be climbing a mountain made of soap...but remain immobile and you don't budge. Try to sit in one place in water or paragliding and you lose stamina, but you can hang onto the sheerest rock face in Hyrule for days without sleep as long as you stop moving. 

It's a good game, but let's not paint it as perfect when it's far from it."
100416,I wish Breath of the Wild would learn from more games than they would learn from Breath of the Wild. I legit have trouble thinking of a single thing they did emphatically well that hasn't been done by someone else.
100542,"&gt; Not only is it a great height, there is also a kill zone beneath a certain altitude. Climbing down slowly activates the kill floor, and there is even a way to cancel fall damage entirely, but it doesn't matter when you never reach the bottom.

That's legitimately disappointing. I noticed the other day that Stamella shrooms grew on the plateau and entertained the idea of a rune-less speedrun. So much for freedom."
100605,"&gt; To get through the cold part you really do need to choose between pursuing the tunic or learning how cook hot food.

Erm, the way you pursue the tunic is through learning how to cook hot food."
100662,"Hell, this also makes sense as a New Game + option."
100944,"I feel it depends on the puzzles. I enjoyed the circuit ones myself, though I think the most lateral were the Cryonis puzzles. Haven't hit 120 shrines yet, but more often than not when I found an alternative solution, it seemed to sidestep the puzzle entirely."
101061,"&gt;  The old man tells you to find four shrines, but with your own freaking eyes instead of giving you three quest markers.

This part also gets old really fast. I get that when I'm given a ""find x"" quest I'm supposed to find it, but give me a fucking area to work within."
101150,"In that sense, it truly is a microcosm of the game."
101209,"Oh come off it, including something you get no use out of is not catering to you."
101342,"&gt; I can't stand actual tutorials, they are just a lazy and boring way of showing me how to play.

That you don't like them doesn't make them lazy and boring."
103368,"It tells you the region, sure. Telling you the region isn't very helpful when the regions are so big."
104411,"A few. I've had ""Find this Statue in the Gerudo Highlands,"" ""Find this statue's sword in the Gerudo Highlands,"" ""Find this shrine, it's somewhere in that sandstorm,"" ""Find these bones in the Eldin, Hebra and Gerudo regions,"" ""Find these monuments near Zora's Domain,"" just off the top of my head.

The Kass Shrine quests are usually very good about giving directions, but any side quests give very broad directions."
124150,Different isn't always better. I'd prefer a more intuitive set of instructions than a vague set.
151476,"&gt; And sure. Generally everything has been done already in the gaming industry. What HASN'T been done already?
&gt; 

I can name a few features in Witcher, FFXV, Fallout, Skyrim and Horizon that are examples of what hadn't been done until they came along. I can't do the same for BotW."
156029,"Skyrim pretty well set the bar for how Open World games play. They created a living world, with characters rooted in their own routines, alongside a large library of books, drinks, food, spells and weapons. I don't think I've seen a sandbox that operated on the scale Skyrim did before it.

Witcher's done pretty well for itself with its character biography and bestiary sections. It's refined the storytelling aspect in open-world games and raised the bar in voice acting and animation quality. I think Witcher has done for story what Skyrim did for the sandbox quality of the world, while also incorporating a build system where choices were pitted against each other and not flat unlocks.

Witcher's storytelling success is built on groundwork laid by Fallout, which brought divergent choices into an open world setting. Baldur's Gate did *attempt* to do this, but they hardly made an open-world game in doing so, and most choices didn't really matter, just one's reputation value.

FFXV did an amazing job creating a reactive cast. Each main character is well crafted and responds appropriately to all manner of stimuli, from battle performance to how long they've gone without sleep or a bath.

Horizon has done a good job mixing a lot of these qualities, but I think its hallmark is a battle system where different parts of your enemies have different weaknesses, can disable different abilities and can be leveraged against other enemies."
211205,"&gt; Majora's Mask (2000). Everything felt alive in that game (At the time.) In fact. The game pretty much as what both Witcher and Skyrim expanded on. MM had some very fun gameplay too. And personally Skyrim was rather clunky to me. And Witcher? Ha. Fun is not something that game is to me.
&gt; 

Majora's Mask has credit where credit is due, they did a great job with a three day window making people feel organic. But it's also a **three day window** and not **as many days as you please** like Skyrim and Witcher 3 managed. I applaud them for trying again in BotW, but BotW's attempt was, in my eyes, a step *back* from Majora's Mask.

As far as how fun you found Skyrim or Witcher, again, credit where credit is due. The games' production value and the detail they put into their worlds from an organic standpoint **far** exceed what BotW did. BotW made a very large, but very hollow world by making settlements sparse and designing them from exclusively a game developer's standpoint without taking into consideration the functionality people build their settlements around.

&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles (2011) did what FFXV did as well. Not as expanded but it was there first, characters reacted to battle and post battle. This carried over to X with a few additions.


I haven't played Chronicles, but I *have* played Chronicles X, and while they're certainly the same idea, they're nowhere near comparable in execution. You may as well suggest Baldur's Gate did it first by having characters react to critical hits, other characters dying, and being near death themselves.

The thing FFXV did was not begin the concept of NPCs having react triggers, but the breadth of those triggers and what they consist of. XV was also the first time I've seen that done in an open-world setting. I hesitate to describe what I've seen of Xenoblade as open world.

&gt;Xenoblade Chronicles X (2015) did what Horizon did. Literally the same thing just not as flashy or obvious. But it was in the gameplay.

Comparing the systems here is like comparing Witcher, BotW and FFXV because they all let you drink potions. Yes, there's some overlap, but for the most part they are not the same system, not by a long shot.

Did you actually play Horizon or FFXV?

&gt;So. On a story aspect. Fine. BoTW can learn. But on a gameplay aspect from how the game teaches you to how you play it and how it progresses. To how the mechanics work (And what they could add on in a sequel.) I feel other Open-World games can do far better.

I wouldn't say that in the least. BotW excels in what it allows you to do in the sandbox, insofar as how many of the systems' physics overlap, but it's so damn **inconsistent** with not only its physics, but nearly every implementation of every system in the game, that if anything other games should take a wide breadth. BotW still has a ton of learning to do when it comes to that.

As for ""how the game teaches you to play,"" it doesn't. For some, that's the beauty of it, and it does lead to players experimenting to find out how to play. But the rest of it is trial by fire, and that's somewhat less fun than knowing how the system works baseline and gaining new intricacies.

With each of these games I've played, I've been excited for the future of the genre should their competitors incorporate each game's successes into their own endeavor. With BotW, I can think of no such system that inspires excitement. If anything, with BotW, all I can think of are how many systems need polish and only took a half-assed approach."
255763,"&gt; No I did not. I have seen videos and have heard from my friends who have. I've been told FFXV combat is near identical to Xenoblade X by the Reddit and my friends who have played it. So aside from story, it's really a clone of said game. But less fun. And and the video shows It looks more of a chore than Xenoblade could be if you started grinding. But for the entire game.

Thank you for your candor.

I *have* played those games, Xenoblade Chronicles X, FFXV, Witcher 3, Horizon and Skyrim. To characterize FFXV as ""a Xenoblade X clone, but less fun"" is a display of profound favoritism toward the Xenoblade series. The two tell their stories very differently, play very differently, and feature very different systems.

&gt;As for the system. it's still the same concept at heart. Reacting to the situation and battle and basically the world. They do not react to the world in the Xeno games. However, the main comparison is reacting to what is happening. You said it right, lightly tapped in Xeno, but thoroughly expanded in FF. 
You're downplaying the difference. Xenoblade features an expansion on a beloved system of characters speaking lines based on triggers. In something like Baldur's Gate II, those triggers were very limited and self-contained, pertaining only to their own actions. ""Minsc says x on crit. Minsc says x at 10% HP. Minsc says x at battle start. Minsc says x on death.""  
Sure, you'd have your variances, like random party members being chosen to chime in when nothing in particular is going on, with their lines varying based on the party's reputation. You'd even have occasional custom scripts designed to illustrate the bond between characters, like Minsc going Berserk when Aerie dies, but only if a certain relationship between them had been established...but these were the exceptions, not the rule.

Xenoblade expands on *that* system, adding far more triggers. Now we get triggers like the above but also ""Elma says x when using a ranged attack. Elma says x when using a debuff. Elma says x when using a heal skill."" The exceptions also became more broad, and include responses to a limited degree. In this way we get ""Elma says x when using a heal skill after someone requests a heal.""

FFXV adds character dialogue that is largely unprompted. Character members chime in not just based on what skills they or their compatriots use, but based on battle performance. If someone gets a hot streak, another character may well comment on it. If one character is getting knocked around, another may well comment on it. You'll have characters speak expected lines, things they say when they're in danger or while healing each other from that danger, but you also get instances of them arguing, chastising, apologizing, and not in the ""Sorry, my turn"" way Xenoblade offers when someone asks for a heal and you heal yourself, but in the sense of one character refusing aid and directing their teammate to prioritize the protagonist, of screaming bloody murder when they think you're in grave danger, even if you're not. Moreover, you get them *physically* changing their behavior to interpose themselves without any prompt. And that's all the stuff that *doesn't* include them reacting to the world.

&gt;It makes little difference as it doesn't exactly change anything. It's still a character/development thing. 

Perhaps not to you, but it makes a profound difference in storytelling, character development and immersion.

&gt;And FF doesn't exactly make it better since they follow anime tropes to hell and back.

Tropes are not *bad*. Tropes are not cliches. This bears repeating: **Tropes are not cliches.** People seem to be tripping up on this when they bring them up as a criticism. Tropes are a way of identifying recurring storytelling phenomena. Every example of good storytelling is just as full of tropes as every example of bad storytelling. Complaining about these is like complaining about a work being full of metaphors and similes.

&gt;Inconsistent how? Every single mechanic works properly and in conjunction rather well. There are some that could be improved upon on their own. But when melded together it works to the players favor very well.

In every way. But, since you asked:

* Fire. Many things are arbitrarily not flammable in a way that flies in the face of that intuition. While many things ignite that rightfully should, some ignite disproportionately (Horses and enemies alike seem to be made of dry grass the way they light up) and some don't ignite at all. I can cut down a tree and set fire to the fallen timber to create a campfire. I can set fire to errant dry leaves and wet grass. I cannot set fire to the tree. I cannot set fire to timber that is not flagged as flammable, like the logs hordes of monsters lean their weapons up against. In the rain, I can set fire to wet grass, albeit any fire will be relatively short lived. I cannot set fire to campfires in the rain. I can drink a potion that will render me fireproof, a protection that extends to my clothes but not to my weapons.
* Electricity. I can fire a shock arrow at areas that conduct electricity, not to conduct electricity, but to create a field that bursts outward. Strange, but not inconsistent in and of itself, at least not compared to that this only applies *sometimes*. I can't shoot a shock arrow into a spray of water and have it do this, nor can I shoot a shock arrow into metal planks to electrify whomever is standing on them. I *can* use items I can use magnesis on--no, wait, only the items I can use magnesis on that aren't weapons...which is strange when you consider those **do** conduct electricity when applied to puzzles. 
* Lightning. Somewhat follows intuitive rules, except that it doesn't prioritize high objects over plains, and **will** prioritize Link (and to a lesser extent, other metal) if he's **wielding** items with even a buckle of metal. Wielding, not wearing, because he can stand in a lightning storm in full Hylian Plate and not have to worry in the slightest. That is **not** lightning following the path of least resistance.
* Waterfalls. A whole subset of movement was programmed around them in dealing with the Zora tunic, but the only ones Link can swim up are the ones that have a visible source, not one that spouts from a cliffside.
* Water. Link can create frozen blocks with Cryonis from what is usually **a sheen of water** but only if it's classified as a waterfall. If it's one of those waterfalls-that-isn't or is rain spilling down mountains, it doesn't count.
* Air. Near as I can tell, the intensity of the heat makes no difference in the speed or distance an updraft propels one.
* Exhaustion. Treading water and remaining aloft consume stamina, while hanging onto a rock face does not. Rain causes Link to lose his grip while climbing, but not his footing while running. 
* Cooking. Raw food can be placed onto a fire to cook it. Frozen food cannot be placed onto a fire, it is already considered ""cooked"" and is destroyed. Placing an ingredient in a pot is magically different than applying heat to it directly. This is less of an issue when the cooking method is supposed to come into play (roasting vs. simmering) but when the result is a kabob it becomes another example of inconsistency.
* Vendors. Buying items differs from selling them...sometimes. It depends. If buying from a vendor who is permanently placed, one has to walk up to the item to initiate a buy dialogue. If buying from a roaming vendor, one has to talk to the vendor. One can sell to either vendor using the same system--talk to the vendor--regardless. 
* Durability. Weapons can break. Armor cannot. Both are replaceable. Shields are classified as a weapon in spite of having no offensive capacity (save reflecting Guardian beams, another inconsistency as it is the only thing shields can reflect).
* Weapon replacements. Weapons must be found and cannot be purchased...except for the ancient weapons, champion weapons and the Hylian Shield. Each of these are all acquired in different ways: The ancient weapons through a vendor requiring rupees and components, the champion weapons through a specific NPC requiring components and no rupees, and the Hylian Shield through a vendor requiring only rupees. This would not be a big deal in any other game, but BotW made such a big stink about weapons being *transient* and refused to put in traditional weapon vendors...except for the aforementioned inconsistencies.
* Cutscenes. Some can be skipped, others cannot. This is less painful with (relatively) infrequent unskippable cutscenes like reaching a Monk in a shrine, but downright **agonizing** if it's something you'll probably end up doing sequentially, like unlocking upgrades for your home.
* Voice acting. NPCs either make no sounds, feature grunts, or are fully voiced. Do it or don't.
* Riding. A variety of creatures can be ridden, but only horses can be kept. This is a feature that absolutely did not need to be programmed in, and was a waste of time for having halfassed it.
* Dyes. Largely inconsequential, but ignoring the bad system they implemented, not all pieces can be dyed, colors can only be drawn from items singularly. If we're going off of intuition, black can be made by mixing in dark colors of any hue.

As a final example, that flying machine that is making the rounds as a feather in Nintendo's cap is **another** example of inconsistency: If you stack two metal **anything** on top of each other and climb up, this will not work. The mine cart works only because it has its own special rules.

&gt;However it does. The game locks you in and you should learn all mechanics in the Plateau. Not master, but learn.

It doesn't, though. It locks you in to teach yourself, but it doesn't explicitly *teach* you anything.

"
256940,"&gt;And at that point some areas are still going to be tougher for someone with no gear. Fallout: New Vegas comes to mind. You in the same sense CAN go anywhere. But you take a left from Goodsprings with only starting level gear?
See you in hell then. Those Deathclaws will rip you apart. It's not impossible though. Get better and better gear, level up, and there's your progression. A similiar sense is not only shown but vaguely explained. (Just like FO:NV) And that's one reason BoTW is fun.

Not sure what you're getting at here. There is nothing here related to the game teaching you anything.

&gt;Opposite for me. It makes me lose faith in the genre because if someone does great, guess what? The others will follow with usually under sub-par games. CoughUbisoftCough.

I think your standards are warped. Every game has forced others to push the envelope. Skyrim raised the bar for Witcher, which raised the bar for FFXV, Horizon, BotW and Mass Effect. The successful systems in each of those games will raise the bar for future open world games like CDProjeckt Red's Cyberpunk game.

The years have given us better iterations, not stagnation.

&gt;So the fact that a company that has pretty much only done this genre once before (Xenoblade Chronicles X) Is both good and impressive especially since the game is what many lack.

Horizon, FFXV and BotW all are examples of companies jumping headfirst into an open world game with no prior experience.

And honestly, while I'm glad you enjoyed the game, Xenoblade Chronicles X was not even comparable to its peers. The game was nothing but cringe in terms of storytelling and was single-handedly the most unintuitive gameplay I've experienced...and that's coming from someone who could identify that the combat was very similar in design to traditional MMORPGs. The game does a terrible job of teaching you how its convoluted systems operated, and yes, that's taking into account the manual they give you. There's a reason Witcher 3 was a more successful title: People generally don't want to invest 10 hours of learning to have 20 hours of fun.

&gt;Because of this I very slightly hope that companies look at their quality before throwing out a game now.

I hope the same. I'm not seeing much to inspire that hope, though.

&gt;And I like Open-World games, I like the survival and exploration aspect. but BoTW makes it rewarding. I can only think of three such games that deserve praise in that regards. Now 4 with BotW.

The exploration in BotW is fine. The survival aspect is not a facet that it performed very well in. I think you have a bit of favoritism going if you're putting BotW and Xenoblade Chronicles X above other games that have clearly executed the same premise more intuitively.

&gt;This to me is a great thing. So that means the next type of game like this will be even better than what it is now. Learn from their mistakes which is also good. Something Nintendo, for the most part, are good at.

I don't know how you can say this with a straight face. If it's one thing Nintendo has not done it has been learning from their mistakes. I would be really excited for the next Zelda game, to see how they refined their systems...except everyone seems to be on this kick of telling Nintendo this game is fucking **perfect** when it's clearly **not** just because it's got **Zelda** on the box. You don't learn from your mistakes when people are telling you that you aren't making any.

And Nintendo doesn't learn from their mistakes even when people *are* telling them they are making some. Nintendo's insistence on **not** learning from their mistakes has led to their slow decline from being **synonymous** with **video game systems**--how many parents called a console a ""Nintendo"" regardless of its make--to being a gimmicky first-party reliant sideshow. Nintendo has steadily dethroned itself by refusing to move with trends: First by refusing to move to discs, then by refusing to use the same format of discs as everyone else, then by refusing to keep graphical parity, then by refusing to keep online and social media parity. And all that has been underscored by, until recently, a refusal to make ports an accommodating (read: profitable) process.

BotW has tested the waters on a lot of systems that could result in a really good game...but only if they receive the proper criticism. With everyone praising Zelda while ignoring faults they'd be eviscerating other games for, I wouldn't be pinning my hopes on Nintendo raising the bar.

CDProjeckt Red, on the other hand..."
