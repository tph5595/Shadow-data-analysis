1006,"I liked it, except it felt like the right way to go, but it wasn't. So you chop down the tree and cross it, and the area across the gap is pretty dangerous and hard to get back out of. 

It was a good tutorial, but it was kind of like a 'how to get stuck in a well tutorial'."
7983,"If we're talking about the game showing you the way, I would say no. It's a sheer cliff that you can barely climb with base stamina. I looked at it and thought, 'no, they are doing a good job at guiding me so far, they probably don't expect me to climb that'."
10034,"I mean, fine. People have figured it out. But as a continuation of 'the greatest tutorial of all time', it sucked. You are guided to a blank wall where bokoblins attack you. The path takes you off to some bombable  rocks with a chest. After looking around I thought, 'I guess that's it' and went back.

I understand that that cliff is climbable, but so is every cliff. The tutorial teaches you to chop trees, but it also teaches you that there will be tutorials along your path, and there aren't. Seeing the old man again makes it feel like you are going the right way, but then you are on your own.

And yes, in this game you are often on your own. But at the time of the chopping tutorial, I had just learned that I was not on my own, because the old man was guiding me."
25171,"Okay, a lot of people got it. I'm not trying to say that it is the wrong path. I am saying that the 'greatest tutorial of all time left me confused. I'm not challenging the skill of anybody here except for me. The game lead me all the way to the tree chopping and then lost me. 

I have played other games which had tutorials that didn't leave me lost at the end. In my opinion, this tutorial was not the world's greatest."
25380,"And that is what I was missing. I looked around for the next obvious clue, trying to figure out the right path. But there was no next clue. The tutorial was over and I could have just held the forward button when I got the the cliff."
63237,"It wasn't initial confusion. I left the area in confusion. I got through it right away, but couldn't see the point. I chopped the tree, and then I got lost. If the area across the gap had been just a tiny ledge with one treasure chest, I would have happily opened it and went on my way. Other people could have still climbed the cliff to the shrine.

It was the same in the Lost Woods. I learned that there would be torches along the way and then there weren't any. I wandered around until I made it through and thought, 'huh, I bet there was a clever solution to that', but I blundered through it feeling unsatisfied. (And, yes, I now know the clever solution.)"
68117,"At no point in this game did I get lost and frustrated. In both of the examples, I couldn't find a reward to seek or a punishment to avoid. I just kind of wiggled the joystick until I got to the next part.

The issue I have is that the game wants you to get from A to D. It shows you A and B very clearly, and hides C. It would be satisfying to find C, but the game didn't do enough to challenge me to. Instead I just kind of wandered into D without doing any problem solving."
