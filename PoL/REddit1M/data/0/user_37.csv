9766,"Link is (are) a character too though.   
no different from chief, lara, Samus adn so forth beyond that eh doesn't tend to talk.  

"
9879,"Not the same people genius.  

Also, I don't give a shit about what it means for SJW or even humanity.  
What i do care about, is the fact that getting an option to play as either gender is not 'just' a cosmetic difference result-wise, it will change aspects of the story and the game."
9962,"IMO, the issue isn't the idea that we get a female Link, but the fact they are adding in an option for it.  

either make it a male Link again, or make it a female Link incarnation.  

The choice between the two doesn't for a character like Link"
10042,"If there is voice acting, I hope it is voice acting in the way the series has already had before : hylian gibberish with text boxes to actually show what they are saying.  

Personally I don't mind King Daphness' voice acting in WW, or Midna's gibberish speak in TP or Fi's singing/chanting/whatever."
10309,"Cause it will affect other parts of the story and Link's personality/character defyining moments,  as well of the characters around him.  "
10765,"You literally couldn't change any of the 3D games without changing stuff about either the story, the character relationships or either Link's or other characters' traits and personality.  "
11983,"Ok, quick easy example : any sign of attraction between characters now makes the character bisexual"
12147,"It won't actually lead to different experiences though, it would lead to them creating a dumbed down 'experience' which is capable of facilitating both genders.  

Think : the generic conversations and... well anything really, in games like elder scrolls and MMORPGs and stuff, needed in order to allow for so much dialogue to work in any possible situation.  "
12262,"Yes, someone's sexuality and the way they act to different 'types' of people is a major part of someone's personality last I checked"
12313,"Yeah, if dumbing down the world/characters isn't a problem, then I guess stupid shit like making a gender option would indeed be of no concern to you."
15028,"No they wouldn't be.  

Several interactions in the game would be changed.  
Just in OoT alone you'd pretty much have a different experience with all sages except Impa."
16607,you clearly don't remember the details of many of the games you mention here
19148,"I am against dumbing down shit for the sake of an 'option' we literally never needed before.  

Every single Link we have played has been a pre-determined gender (plus backstory, physical look, abilities and so forth)  
Why would we need a gender option all of a sudden when it just carries a (very real and likely) chance of being detrimental to atleast some aspects fo the game.  
"
19658,"It's not about 'how much' it changes, its about that it is changing/dumbing down and limiting options for the sake of something useless, and something the series has never needed, at all.  

"
19842,"Also, I was writing a list, but without my documents, its hard to really binge down on every single case where stuff like it is relevant.  
So i decided to postpone.  

Especially since its not like people would care about it anyway.  
It's pretty clear that for some god forsakken reason, the idea of being able to choose your secondary chromosome, despite it being almost certaintly a limiter in some way for the game, is actually interesting."
59070,"I never said ruin.  
Nice strawman though"
78089,"Seems silly.  
"
81081,"There is a difference between have negative effects on it, and 'ruin' it"
81240,"&gt;
Link being a woman will not be a game limiter in any way. Just accept it.  

Never said Link being a woman would be an issue you dolt, in fact, quite the opposite, many times by now.  

&gt; I'm still giving you the benefit of the doubt in thinking you're just a stickler for tradition. Otherwise it seems more like you're such a sexist that you actually get upset if playing as a female character in a game is even an option.  

it's the last word in your sentence that is the issue  
 
Also, learn the meaning of sexist.  
Sexist would imply I had an issue with females being put in leading roles or beign given the same chances as males.  
Which isn't what any of the shit I said was about.    

"
81295,"Which is why they should go for the choice that doesn't have a (very real, almost guarenteed) chance to be a negative impact, with frankly no positive ones attached to it.  "
83134,"No it fucking hasn't.  

I said adding the option to be either male or female is stupid and has negative/limiting effects upon games like these

If they felt like having a Link that just so happens to be female, then that would be perfectly fine.  
It's low on my list of interesting stuff to do with new link incarnations (like for real, a Link from a different background/species seems so much more interesting), but there isn't anything wrong with it.  "
