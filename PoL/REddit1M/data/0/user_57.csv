22973,"You kinda can't, though. The vast majority of the world is locked down until you get to a certain point in the story. For example, how can you call Ocarina of Time open-world? You literally can't go to any of the major locations besides the woods, Castle town, Kakariko Village, and Hyrule Field as a kid, and even as an adult, each dungeon (and usually its surrounding location) is locked down until you get a specific item. You can't get into the forest temple without the hookshot, you can't get into the desert without the lens of truth, you can't get into Lake Hylia or Gerudo Valley without a horse etc., and you only get these items at fixed points in the story. Definitely not open-world.

Twilight Princess is the same; where you can and can't go depends on which portals you've opened, which is tied to the story.

There are always going to be certain areas you can't get to from the gate in open-world games, but in Zelda that's usually all of them. I guess it depends on how you define open world, but to me restricting exploration to defined points in the game makes it linear, not open-world."

Well this is a terrible reason to do literally anything.

&gt;If it is coming out on both consoles, than either the game is being pushed back to 2017 or the NX up to 2016, or they are releasing separate versions are whole year apart.

Pretty much everyone with even a hint of insider info says NX is coming out this year. Three of Nintendo's hardware partners have listed the NX launching in 2016 in their investor meetings, and Nintendo has identified how announcing the Wii U over a year before launch was a huge mistake. That said, releasing them a year apart is just as likely; when PS4 and Xbox One launched, their first two years were pretty much nothing but ports from the previous gen.

&gt;you are pretty much guaranteed at least some crappy voice acting in some dubs. I think the best way to do ""VA"" would be for everyone to speak Hylian.

You're pretty much guaranteed at least some crappy acting in basically everything, though. But otherwise, I agree; Midna-like gibberish would probably suit the series best.

&gt;I argue that Link has already been a supporting protagonist at least once in the series - in Twilight Princess.

I don't know how well this would work though, because the whole idea is that Link bears the Triforce and can wield the Master Sword. There have been Zelda games where those didn't really come into play, but as far as I can remember, all of the main series console titles used those tropes. The Master Sword is the only thing that can stop Ganon, the chosen hero is the only one who can wield it. That said, there's something to be said about not having Ganon as the villain.

&gt;a legacy character that has well-established conventions.

So? Zoras were enemies for half the series until they were suddenly friendly. And again, playing as an already-established character means no Triforce and no Master Sword, which in my opinion would be a far greater departure than having a female Link. I mean, he's a voiceless protagonist. In some games he's an orphan, in some he's a farmer, sometimes he's a kid, sometimes he's grown up. This character is really not as set in stone as you're making him out to be; there's literally no reason the hero of time couldn't be born as a girl one generation.

&gt;As for future games,

I don't know why people keep assuming that what they do in one game must carry forward into the future. We never got to play as a wolf after Twilight Princess, we never got a side-scroller after Zelda II, never hopped between child and adult after Ocarina of Time. Just because it happens in this game doesn't mean it's going to have a profound affect on the series moving forward.

&gt;Here is a unique idea.

That actually is a pretty cool idea, though it'd be tricky to do. I don't know how many people would enjoy playing a game and not getting the ending, then in essence going all the way back to the beginning to play a somewhat different version of it and then have to beat that to get the ending. I guess it worked for Fire Emblem, but in that case you're still getting a full game no matter which version you pick.

They might be able to do it Resident Evil 0 style and have you switch characters on the fly, but that can also get hairy, especially with a big, open world."
24211,"&gt;I think what makes it open is that once you get to those places, you can still go back and forth freely whenever you want.

This is a fair point.

&gt;When you first get to Hyrule Field in Ocarina, sure you're supposed to go to castle town, but (and correct me if I'm wrong) you don't have to. You can explore Lake Hylia or Lon Lon Ranch. It is definitely an open world.

Kind of true, but kind of not. You can strike out in any direction, but 90% of the time you're going to hit a road block until you advance the story enough.

I guess as far as Ocarina goes, it's almost like Hyrule Field is an open world, but the areas beyond aren't as much. So I guess it's at least somewhat of an open-world game.

That said, I think when people say they want an open world Zelda, they mean something akin to the first game. You can go almost everywhere from the gate, and only some of the dungeons themselves can't be entered, and a few of them can't be completed unless you do other dungeons first. It's a bit different from something like Ocarina where you can't even think of going to, say the spirit temple until you've gone back and forth through time, done the thieves' hideout quest, gotten the warp song, gotten the lens of truth, etc."
24229,"&gt; The lack of true voice acting is what makes Zelda what it is.

Of all of the things this series has established over 30 years, the lack of voice acting is what makes a Zelda game?"
25346,"Yeah, I think a lot of people consider linear and open-world to be opposites, but connected vs. broken up world is another facet of it for sure."
