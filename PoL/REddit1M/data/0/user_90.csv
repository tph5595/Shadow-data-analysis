139459,"That depends how story driven the game is and how chatty NPCs are. If they want to have NPC who have more than puddle-deep relationships with the player the player's gender does matter to an extent.

"
139668,"&gt; This is Nintendo EAD. They know their stuff. It's it's not up to qulaity they wouldn't put it in the game

That covers the Japanese version, but doesn't mean anything for the English dub."
139734,In an industry where someone can take your idea and turn it into a product and ship it to market in six months I totally get why they are secretive.
140012,"I see the gender swap option two ways.

You either have a story where the character gender is irrelevant. In this instance I don't see the harm in offering an option.

In a game where there is a lot of story and deep NPCs if you are going to have a female lead they need to be well written around, it needs to feel like the change matters.

My fear is they'll land somewhere inbetween where the story tries to acknowledge player gender and just does a bad job of it making the change feel forced and dumb.

If they can do it properly great, but when we are talking about the company that barely writes stories to begin with that is a big if."
140111,"Also it's a lot of money to spend on something that most people will consider nerdy.

I assume if they want VO they are doing it to appeal to people other than Zelda fans so you'd want it to be accessible. "

From what I've seen the the main fear here isn't actually related to the Link's gender itself, but that we are going to get a poorly written game because of a change in gender.

It's not an unwarranted concern either, Nintendo doesn't really have a track record of strong writing.

If they go the full hog and write two full sets of fleshed out dialogue I'm all for a gender option, but if it is going to be half-assed I'd prefer not."
145121,"It seems to me the reasons people don't want the gender change, don't want VO and don't want the game to be to heavily influence by Skyrim are largely the same; that they fear the game will be worse off in terms of quality because Nintendo isn't sticking to what they know.

I get that, but Nintendo have done what they know to death so I'm open to some experimentation."
146404,"What Nintendo does and what NoA/NoE do when localising are different things though.

Even if they somehow manage to do it right in the development phase there is still that second change to mess up for the English version.

Overall I totally get why people are hesitant about the gender thing, about VO, about open world, because it is all uncharted territory for Nintendo and could so easily go wrong.

Really all we can do is hope."
