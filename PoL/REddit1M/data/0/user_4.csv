978,"What's the point of having Link switch gender? Never once throughout the 90's and early/mid 00's has the gender of the characters been an issue. Now all of a sudden, companies are caving in to small offended groups who get triggered if they play as a male character?

Are we going to be given the option to choose a male Samus in the next Metroid game? This is so ridiculous."
1294,"Then you'd be a part of a small minority then. Most girls on YouTube have expressed they don't care about the gender. In fact, the majority of us don't want to have our characters switch gender, just like how I, as a guy, would NOT support having Samus' gender changed to male. If I'm playing a Metroid game, I'm playing it as a female Samus like it has always been."
1717,"My point is just that, where does it stop? Should I also be offended that Link is a white character so as a guy with dark skin, I can't relate to him. So then we should also have the option to change his skin color and hair color as well.

In the end, if it continues like this, we're going to end up having to only use our Miis in games in order to not offend a bunch of people. It's stupid."
1944,"So let's give options to change his skin color too. And his hair color. And his eye styles, his height, his weight. Let's just incorporate the Mii creator, wouldn't that be the best?"
2031,"So since Nintendo doesn't allow you to change Link's skin color, by your logic does that make them racist?"
2109,"Except The Legend of Zelda has a storyline and a timeline inbetween the games, which means that being able to customize the character's personalities makes it impossible to fit them in relation to other games in the storyline."
2802,Why don't I have the option to change Link's skin color?
2847,Do I have a right to feel that Nintendo is being racist then for making Link only available as a white person then?
3083,"You don't get my point. It's not the same Link, but it's the same timeline.

So imagine if you got to choose your gender in OoT. Then how are they going to portray Hero's Spirit in TP?"
4998,You know what would be cool though? Samus as a guy.
7157,"&gt; the chosen one just so happens to pop out as female, right?

No. See, that's the thing, the chosen one is popping out as a male/female where you have to choose.

If it had been a female hero only then yeah I could probably get behind it but when you suddenly give the player customizability to change different things, suddenly it's going to be hard to connect the games together because some players chose this and other players chose something else."
7549,So why am I not allowed to have more agency in the metroid world by playing as a guy?

2. I linked it to show that others have already mentioned games like Mass Effect. Look at my reply to it."
83002,"1. Mass Effect doesn't have a timeline like Zelda.

2.  It defies the timeline."
