4271,"Nothing in its history has ever said that Link's new form has to be a male. In fact, we've only ever even seen 2 actual reincarnations of Link in 3D Zelda. It's entirely possible this Link isn't a reincarnation of previous Links/the story could be pre-SS. 

OOT- Actual reincarnation 

MM- Same kid as OOT

WW- Not a reincarnation

TP- Reincarnation 

SS- The first Link."
