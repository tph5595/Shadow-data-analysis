38470,Really excited for a female Link. Much overdue
38544,You mean like they have in every single game besides SS?
38628,"Link is not a character. He is a vessel for the player to project on. If half the world population is not represented in that, you are doing something seriously wrong."
38872,"First dem wimmens wantin' to vote, and now they want to be represented by a character who is meant to represent everyone? What's dis world coming to?? (sarcasm)

Samus is a defined character with a voice, a name, a personality and a backstory. Link is a blank slate meant to represent everyone. Having a gender **OPTION** would not do anything but good for the Zelda franchise."
40324,"Yes, and how does this negate my argument lol? You're really scraping the bottom of the barrel, guy."
72144,"Fine, but that doesn't change the fact that those arguments are correct. Explain one negative effect of having a female Link."
74622,"Changing the gender of a character, doesn't really change anything. Are you saying choice has no place in games? Look at Mass Effect or the Walking Dead. Both games are huge and offer choices that not only add more replay value, but also make each playthrough more personal to the player. 

Also, a gender choice is so trivial it wouldn't even really change anything. There was some kind of romance with Zelda in some choice games, but they could easily a. cut that from the story b. cut that from the female story or c. have a lesbian romance. None of those would really hurt the story in any way.

All a gender choice does is create diversity and allows more of their audience to identify with the ~~character~~  vessel. If the 'chosen one' is reincarnated again and again, would it really be so unrealistic for that chosen one to MAYBE be female? 

If the prospect of choice (a mechanic which is very prominent in, say, Majora's Mask, which most people I've met say in their favorite Zelda game) really frustrates you so much, then Nintendo could easily say 'okay so this choice is canon' and it'd be over with. 

Also, what did you do for the 25 years when the Zelda timeline wasn't established? How did you know which game was canon and which was not? Did it stop you from enjoying the games? No? Thought not."
77961,"1. I would love to have character customization for Link. Again, it would only add more to the game.

2. Mass Effect. Walking Dead. Fallout. Knights of the Old Republic. All of those games and more have several installments and all allow major choices in the story and there is no problem. Knowing that, please explain how such a trivial thing such as a gender change would have such a catastrophic effect on the story."
79905,"1. Yes I want it because it would add to the game. The people who don't want it can use the default options.

2. This supports my argument :P"
82025,"1. Changing their gender does nothing. Again, games like Mass Effect have much bigger choices and fans don't care. Are you saying games should just be a rollercoaster ride with no choices? 

2. Again, changing their gender does nothing. Again, please explain the harm that changing their gender does. All you've done so far is support my arguments."
83872,"1. &gt; What did you do for the 25 years when the Zelda timeline wasn't established? How did you know which game was canon and which was not? Did it stop you from enjoying the games? No? Thought not.

2. Where in the timeline does it say that the hero has to be a male?"
89136,"1. We never had a complete timeline. We knew ALTTP was a prequel, AOL and MM were sequels and other small things, but we never knew how they were connected or the full timeline.

2. I did the math and there are about eleven Links in the current Zelda 'canon'. Eleven. Thousands of years. That is not a majority."
90716,"Customizing his/her race would be great, and while I don't think that you can't project onto an avatar who doesn't share your gender or race, it certainly helps for some reason, helps diversify the game, and for some people it really makes the game more accessible. "
91530,"1. Sorry, bad wording on my part. Connected as in how the stories related to each other, not where they fall on the timeline.

2. I'm not selfish, I just want games to be more inclusive. The worst thing having the option to play as a girl would create is a slight nuisance for those who care. And for those people, they can play as the white dude they know and love. It doesn't affect them."
