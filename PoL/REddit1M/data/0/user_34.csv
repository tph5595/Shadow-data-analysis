8768,"I just hope Zelda runs and looks beautiful on the Wii U. If Xenoblade can have that kind of scenery I'm sure Zelda U will look nice. (NX makes me nervous)

Also, I'd totally play a female Link. That would be awesome! (As long as she is over 18 so when I get a chub I don't feel bad about it)

Voice acting would be weird but I'm down with just keeping Link silent.

Rumours are fun."
