1647,"Some games have characters that are actual characters, with their own personalities and names. Lara Croft, Master Chief, Samus, etc. You cannot and will never be able to choose their gender, for the same reason you can't choose their name. Because these are characters that you're playing as, not characters who represent you.

Other games have characters who're blank slates, with no personalities or names. You name them yourself, you can often choose their gender, in some games you can even control what they look like. Because these characters are meant to serve as representations of you in the game. The Pok√©mon games, the Fable series, Mass Effect, and yes, the Legend of Zelda all have blank-slate characters like this.

There's overlap, of course, but this is a pretty fundamental aspect of game design and a choice games make when they design their main character. Link has always been a blank slate. so it wouldn't be a stretch to be able to choice his gender in future games."
2537,"No, because the games feature different characters. And in the case of games that feature the same character, like OoT-&gt;MM, the same person playing the games in the same way doesn't mess up the timeline for him. Especially since Zelda's only real nod to this is that you get to name Link, and Link doesn't ever actually say anything so that you can fill in your own dialogue for him.

I mean seriously, look at Mass Effect. There, you make actual decisions which carry over into later games in the series. Does that screw up the timeline? No, because you keep playing with the same character!"
3333,"Maybe you will. Pokemon X and Y let you choose the main character's skin color. If they're really allowing you to customize Link more you might be able to choose his too.

Probably not since all the mythology of the Zelda series has established Hylians as being white with pointy ears, but hey, they've changed the appearance of Gorons and Zoras before. I doubt it would be difficult to make it so that all the Hylians have roughly the same skin color as whatever you choose for Link."
6879,"Link is more of a blank slate than Mario. Mario is Mario in every game, but you name Link."
8454,Because Mario is always Mario. Link is whoever you want him to be.
9249,Agreed. Link is missing enough traits so you can pretend that Link is you. Gender is just another trait that can easily be dropped without affecting the story.
9626,Hero's Spirit is a skeleton in armor. Can you tell the difference between a male and female skeleton?
9747,Why would they not be Link if you had the option to make them female? Does Link's gender matter to the story? Is there any point where Link being a male is a fundamental quality that makes him Link? 
40125,"I know that it's possible to tell the difference from skeletal structure, and I should have phrased it better since after all, text doesn't carry intonation. Can *you,* personally, tell the difference? If so, would you be able to based on the graphics of a nintendo gamecube? Would the vast majority of consumers be able to?

And whoops, you're right, it's a ghost. Oh well. The armor still makes it such that if it was a female ghost, you wouldn't be able to tell."
