18161,Link is as about a defined character as a glass of water with toast. He has no personality what-so-ever and being able to play as a female version would be pretty sweet. 
18291,Links gender has never been used in the story though apart from the light romance in skyward sword. All of the other games you could make Link a girl and nothing would be different.
18452,Then what are some of the details? From what I can remember of the games the only ones that would be changed much would be SS and OoT like in the above list. Your saying the creator of the list forgot some but you didn't mention any.
24398,I agree that if they chose just for link to be female it could make for some interesting decisions. I see what you mean about how if you can chose it removes the ability for them to make gender have meaning.
