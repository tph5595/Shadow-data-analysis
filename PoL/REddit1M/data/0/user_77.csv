Voice acting and female Link are not things I've seen people suggesting as a serious possibility but they've still been suggested as stuff that 'would be cool' or 'maybe it's about time' a million times in every Nintendo thread and subreddit.

It's like someone made up these rumours just to excite us specifically."
77823,"They could always say that Link is male canonically and the female version exists for aesthetics only, for those who want it. But who knows at this point?"
81170,Yeah maybe but it really doesn't matter what Nintendo does because a bunch of people will be pissed off no matter what.
