42396,"Each iteration of the game is a new person ""becoming"" Link. Each one has their own quirks and relationships. SS Link had a big crush on Zelda. TP's Link was basically a farmhand. WW's Link was an attitude-filled little shit, AND had an actual family involved in the story. They're all their own character, and just because one was more romantic with that Link's Zelda, doesn't mean they all have to be now."
42687,"Literally the only thing that would have to change is if certain character's flirt with you or not. And even then that would only *have* to be changed in the more obvious cases. Just because Link could have different parts doesn't mean the writers won't make a fantastic game.

I'm sorry that you might not be able to play out your fantasies of every girl in a game wanting to suck your dick but don't act like it's going to ruin the game."
43027,"It could be, but I don't know if Nintendo has that good of a market sense. I still feel like SS's story was good and contained in that one game, and the next game can have a different relationship.

Personally I'd love to see more battle-buddy pairs with the two."

Think : the generic conversations and... well anything really, in games like elder scrolls and MMORPGs and stuff, needed in order to allow for so much dialogue to work in any possible situation.
 
? 

&gt; either make it a male Link again, or make it a female Link incarnation.
The choice between the two doesn't [sic] for a character like Link

&gt; it is changing/dumbing down and limiting options for the sake of something useless

&gt; it will affect other parts of the story and Link's personality/character defyining [sic] moments, as well of [sic] the characters around him


You seem to care a whole lot about how badly this will apparently affect a video game."
80461,"Still pretty sure you don't have anything that's not just an incredibly petty point that you feel *needs* to be in the games for them to work.

Link being a woman will not be a game limiter in any way. Just accept it. I'm still giving you the benefit of the doubt in thinking you're just a stickler for tradition. Otherwise it seems more like you're such a sexist that you actually get upset if playing as a female character in a game is even an *option.*"
82885,What?? Your entire argument has been about how making Link a female would have negative effect on the series!
