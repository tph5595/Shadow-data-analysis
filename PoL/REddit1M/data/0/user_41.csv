10699,I'm more worried about what this means for the story. If you can pick your own gender in this game then that probably means you can in every future game as well. So this will likely mean that links relationship with Zelda will probably stay the same as just friends. 
10969,Yeah and because of Skyward Sword pushing there relationship even so slightly that the next game will expand on that. But if there is a female Link then probably not.
18944,Oh absolutely but if they do decide to make gender an option then they will probably stick with that like how Pokemon and Fire Emblem did. I would be ok with it if it was one or the other.
42617,Well think of it from a development stand point. Alot of people hated Skyward Sword except for the relationship between Zelda and Link. It would make sense for Nintendo to add onto that relationship sense that's what alot of people loved about Skyward Sword. 
102082,I'm ok with that.
114201,I mean yeah but do you think Nintendo would do that? Probably not.
