32323,"I think the only thing I'm so-so on is voice acting, definitely not opposed to it because it would be interesting, but I would like it if we had a choice to also have japanese dialogue with english subtitles. Sometimes I feel certain aspects are lost in translation, perhaps not as much as they were in the past, but it's also a little bit of why I prefer watching subs over dubs. They have to fit the english to the japanese mouth movements and will sometimes cut out a word or two that can change the way something is phrased and be misconstrued, maybe not always in a major way but I've seen it in the past. That's just my opinion though! 

Regardless of the rumors, I hope to the high heavens we get to see massive amounts of details at E3 this year."
