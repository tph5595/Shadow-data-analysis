4931,"No one was offended that Link was a male. It was more of a ""Y'know what would be cool? The choice to be a female Link."" situation rather than an ""OMG, you must be inclusive!"" situation.

Link is you, the player. That's why he's called Link. He's your link to the game world.

It's weird when I play Zelda and a character shout a female name at my clearly male character. So, I'll enjoy having a female character.

Characters like Samus or Mario are actual characters so you wont see Shamus or Maria as character options. Link isn't a character, he's you.

As for the idea of skin alteration, it's a fair request. Maybe they'll include that too. They did say they were going for a more Western design style so I wouldn't be surprised, if the gender rumour is true, if we had the ability to alter name, gender, skin tone and hair. No fat/thin or tall/short sliders, though."

I don't want the game feeling bland and artificial when Zelda has an American accent, which wouldn't fit, or cliche with an English accent."

In the centuries that Link has been showing up time and again, surely, even just once, the chosen one just so happens to pop out as female, right?

This has absolutely zero impact on the games story, the series lore, the gameplay or anything else."
