202176,"I hate how so many gamers are happy when companies make changes in response to fan feedback, except when those changes are about being more inclusive to other genders/races/etc - then, apparantly, it's ""giving in to SJW crap"".

I can understand, and to some extent agree with, people worrying that having two options for a player might result a less fleshed out character/more generic interactions with other characters. But when people act like Nintendo would be committing a horribly betrayal by making a female the main character of a Zelda game, or that ""SJWs"" are taking over (Oh no, now only 90% of games feature straight white male protagonists instead of 95%), it's just... stuff like that is why gamers have such a bad reputation lately."
