3092,"Most of these rumor posts are better indicators of what *won't* happen.  It's always that obvious over-hyped idea that Nintendo never goes for.  Take the most popular gossip bullshit and say ""They're gonna do that!"" and bam, 'reliable rumor'.

And then everyone always looks back in hindsight of how nonsense these rumors always are, like how did anyone ever believe that?"

And that's good.  Open worlds that consist of 'walk around' are by far the worst kind.  It's just empty walking space for the sake of seeming big without any real substance.

What's so appealing about a large empty walking space?"

You can still have an open world which is restricted by item functions and physical barriers.  That's almost certainly how Zelda U's will be."
