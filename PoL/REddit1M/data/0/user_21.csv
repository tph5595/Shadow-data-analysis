4304,"My thoughts from /r/nintendo:

&gt;I'm calling shenanigans.
&gt;
&gt;Though Emily's tweet says that you can choose between a male and female playable character, it does not say that you can choose between Male/Female Link, so OP's title is misleading. The two things are not necessarily the same.
&gt;
&gt;Personally I see no utility in making a gender-swapped Link. It would feel more like a ""statement"" than something that adds to the game. Link, as the legacy character he is, is always male. Though there is a breadth of unique female characters (I'm not talking about Linkle) and potential female characters to play as. One thing I could see is an optional co-op dungeon that would allow player 2 to play as a female character, or other characters.
&gt;
&gt; If it is coming out on both consoles, than either the game is being pushed back to 2017 or the NX up to 2016, or they are releasing separate versions are whole year apart.
&gt; 
&gt; I'm not ready to judge to VA idea yet, but I err on the side of VA not suiting Zelda well. Will it be just for cutscenes? Or for all characters? There's too many random NPC's in the overall for the latter imo, and too many languages to translate into - you are pretty much guaranteed at least some crappy voice acting in some dubs. I think the best way to do ""VA"" would be for everyone to speak Hylian.

and

&gt; So in the canon, there is no reason why the ""Chosen Hero"" can't be female. Having a heroine save Hyrule is perfectly consistent with the canon.

&gt;Of course, you could do this even without changing the playable Link. Imagine a Zelda game in which Link is a supporting protaganist, and a major supporting female character is really the hero of the day and actually the focus of the story. In fact, I argue that Link has already been a supporting protagonist at least once in the series - in Twilight Princess.
&gt;
&gt; Now, as far as a playable female option. You can have a playable female that isn't just a gender-swapped Link. I mean, you have a series-wide deuteragonist whom the series is named after - you could play as Zelda! Almost every main Zelda game has major female characters, such as Tetra, Medli, Ruto, Impa, Saria, Malon, Marin, Midna, Hilda, and all the incarnations of Zelda - I'm sure Zelda U will introduce more. You could play as one of them.
&gt;
&gt;Link himself though is a legacy character that has well-established conventions. One of those conventions is being male. Its just part of his character. He is the main character in Nintendo's second-most popular title. Tinkering with his gender would come across as pandering and frankly, random.
&gt;
&gt;Again, I will stress, Emily's rumor tweet is vague, and does not specifically state that you can play as a female Link. As for future games, and maybe this game, there are many different paths Nintendo could take when it comes to player character variability:
&gt;
&gt;* An optional co-op dungeon or two. Player 2 could play as another of Zelda U's characters. This is admittedly a small measure
&gt;
&gt;* A spinoff or gaiden game in which you play as Zelda or some other female character. Well, Hyrule Warriors technically already fulfills this option, but I would gladly except a more traditional Zelda game in which you play as Zelda or some other female character.
&gt;* Here is a unique idea. The game is split into two quests, each quest being carried out by a different character. After you finish each quest, they combine for the last part of the game. So lets say you have Link doing typical hero stuff, and you have a new female character doing hero stuff. At the beginning, on the file select screen, you choose which quest to do first. After you finish the first quest, you move on to the second. Then you finish the second quest, and then efforts of Link and the new female character are combined in the ending. Of course, this will make sense in the framework of the game's story. Something like the Oracle games, except that you are play as two different characters whose adventures are going on simultaneously, perhaps in the same world. Heck, maybe they're adversaries! But the player never realizes it until the ending - so its a big shocking reveal!"
