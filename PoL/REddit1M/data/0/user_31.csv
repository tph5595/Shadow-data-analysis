7897,"I'd agree with the female characters of Zelda need their own games, especially Sheik. Ninja platformer action game, please? Especially Tetra! ARRR, pirate games!

HOWEVER, nothing about Link's character requires him to be male. Maybe various princesses won't demand to marry him, that's about it. Most Links are complete audience POVs with no real character at all, I'd say Toon Link is the most established character-wise, and he could have just as easily been female and not changed that story in any way. If you can change my main character's gender and not change the story intentions in any way, the gender is irrelevant and can be just as easily be up to audience choice. So go ahead then."
12043,Does that really change their character though?
