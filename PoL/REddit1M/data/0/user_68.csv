We don't need to though, because the Hero's Shade actually ISN'T a skeleton in armour. He's a [ghost](http://zeldawiki.org/images/6/63/Hero%27s_Shade.png) in armour. A ghost who, based on the frame and proportions of the body, is decisively male."

The width of the shoulders alone is pretty telling, especially compared to the width of the hips, as is the structure of his rib cage and the form of his legs and how he stands. As for the armour, the way the chestplate is shaped is pretty form-fitting for a male; the same general aesthetic could apply for a woman, but it would definitely have to be a different shape to account for different proportions, and of course breasts.

Granted, this is all not so immediately obvious to the untrained eye, but if the Hero's Shade was supposed to be a girl, the features would be a LOT different. Enough so that someone that doesn't know the details the way I do would be able to tell."
