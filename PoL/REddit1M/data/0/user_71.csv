42378,"I don't like the idea of having a female Link (Linkle? lol), because it would likely make all the dialogue much more ambiguous and vague. You can't have girls freaking out over Link if the gender is optional, and I doubt that Nintendo could be bothered to make adjustments to the game to account for the main character's gender. 
The way that people talk to and interact with a man or a woman is definitely different, especially in Japan. It wouldn't make sense to see Linkle hanging out with the Gorons in their hotsprings, calling each other ""bruddah."" 

I actually would like to see a Zelda game with a female Link, but not one with the option of either. Having a set character of a set gender and standing makes the story more compelling and immersive, I feel."
42791,I think that TP would be quite different. The way he interacts with Telma and his kid friends. The boys look up to him and the girls like him. Naturally that would be different. 
112858,"Really, it'd be the opposite of the way it is in TP. The boys would probably have kid crushes on her and the girls would look up to her in an older sister kind of way.

I mean, really, I'm fine if Nintendo actually does decide to do the gender choice thing as long as they put in the effort of tailoring the game and leaving out all the potential ambiguity. "
140656,"Yeah, I absolutely agree. I doubt Nintendo would do that, but it would be a nice median."
