1523,Yeah I get where you're coming from. In a way it gives me the heebie jeebies to think of Link being a girl. It kinda waters down his awesomeness to make him editable in any big way.
171398,"That's a good point, like maybe a few more years down the line they'd give him more editable options and it would just end up looking like Skyrim or some other game I don't really care about. At first it sounded like an okay idea, but I just hate the idea of a ""create your character"" screen in Zelda. Link is and always will be Link. His same iconic self. The idea of Miis in Zelda makes me want to puke tears."
