41195,"I know the Zelda lore makes a point to distinguish WW Link from any blood relation to the others and I may be a little too late to make this argument, but over reliance on a Link/Zelda relationship would not only get stale after awhile, but also grow a pretty heavy implication on incest in the royal family if it's a series of the royal blood always ""linking up"" with the chosen hero (pun only half-heartedly intended).

With as vague as most titles are to draw connections between past/future heroes, I can't see any serious implications this would have on the lore.  Most of the time the ""hero"" only has ever seemed gender neutral anyway."
