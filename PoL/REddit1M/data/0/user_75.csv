55932,"I do hope you're right about the female protagonist. I am 100% unopposed to playing as a female character, as long as it's either Zelda or some new original character. Just making a reverse gender counterpart to a character as iconic as Mario for the sake of pandering would be pointless and kinda lazy. If they ever actually get around to making another Metroid game, will that have gender options too? Will I get to play as Seamus Aran? How about the Super Maria Sisters?

On the flip side, they could make a new character (or Zelda) and have them use a slightly different playstyle, the Virgil to Link's Dante, if you will. Then we'd have gender options AND some added replay value. Even Hyrule Warriors did a better job with making Linkle a unique character than just making her ""Link, but with boobs.""

As for the voice acting, I think we should keep an open mind. Everyone's afraid it'll be bad, and comparing it to Pokken, but as a counterpoint, I'd like to point out Kid Icarus: Uprising, that's voiceover was part of what made the game so memorable. Plus the simlish thing is fine when it's one character like Midna doing it, but I think if everyone in the game started doing it it would get annoying fast."
