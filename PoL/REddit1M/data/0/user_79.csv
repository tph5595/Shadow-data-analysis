Some may argue that Zelda should incorporate more open world elements, more choice in terms of how to tackle the world, etc. etc. ALBW does this, for instance. Nobody is really suggesting that we remove all puzzle/progression elements and transform Hyrule into Skyrim."
85989,"No, a lot of people have been saying that (myself included) but it's difficult to say whether Nintendo will have picked up on that nuance if they choose to go for voice acting."
86222,"As a Brit, I would... much of the established humour and speech in Zelda games doesn't fit the way we talk. Think non-English VA is the way to go if we're going to do it."
86284,"But that's the thing, a lot of the dialogue in Zelda games is purposefully goofy, and won't translate well into speech."
86502,"Agreed. Unless they do branching storylines, which is possible, but unlikely (think Mass Effect romance options, but not just for the romance) with a Zelda game. Giving the player this kind of choice would probably constrain the narrative. Better just to make this iteration of Link a female and leave it like that, if they must."
88350,"If you want to make that argument then why not race? How about the fact that the majority of the world's population isn't represented by Link's ethnicity? Should there also be an option to pick black, mixed, Hispanic, Asian, south Asian, and Middle Eastern Links?

The very nature (or lack thereof) of Link's character is such that it's is very easy to project into him even if he does not share your gender or race. Other than not being able to give her my own name (small issue) I don't feel that I would feel more disconnected from a female Link, if the case was reversed and there was no option to play as a male."
88840,"That creating a world full of primarily bisexual characters for the sake of a game mechanic (choosing sex) is unrealistic and constraining. Writers don't have the freedom of writing characters as they wish to because if there is romance it has to be written to pander to that mechanic.

The problem doesn't exist if Link is only male or only female. The only way around it is to write out different interactions for male and female Links, which I don't see Nintendo doing."
89257,"It'd be awkward when the fish lady and desert warrior lady and farm girl *all* show same-sex attraction to female Link. 'Course you can correct for it by writing in male characters to balance it out but then you end up with a much higher incidence of bisexual characters than would see believable in the established Zelda universe.

You can also choose to not have any of these elements ofc, and that's fine if it's what the writers were going to do anyway, but otherwise it's limiting creative freedom."
89372,"Also some changes in dialogue, if you want to keep interactions rich and natural and flowing, but yeah, nothing too huge."
93158,"&gt; Customizing his/her race would be great

I just don't see the point. It's a fantasy universe. Our own ethnicities mean next to nothing in that cultural setting. In that context, changing race (removed from cultural meaning) is entirely superficial and feeling more attached to a character who is aesthetically similar to you becomes completely shallow imo.

&gt; while I don't think that you can't project onto an avatar who doesn't share your gender or race, it certainly helps for some reason, helps diversify the game, and for some people it really makes the game more accessible. 

I agree with this generally, but I just think in the case of a blank slate character like Link it is very much less the case. But yeah I can see the appeal in it. I just don't think it's worth it *unless* Nintendo is prepared to write slightly different dialogue/scenes for both sexes and not compromise any of their characters by resorting to bland gender-neutral writing.

Some people here seem to think this wouldn't be an issue but it's easy to think of characters within the Zelda universe who one might expected to treat a male or female link differently (nothing that would divert the course of the story but enough to change dialogue).

My problem here is that I don't feel that Nintendo would bother to put in the extra effort (but who knows, maybe I'm wrong, and that would be cool, and add some replayability for some people), and that it would take something away from their characters."
99592,"More options for the player, under limited resources = fewer options for the writer, yeah. It's a trade off, unless Nintendo decide to invest in branching/altered dialogue."
151787,"Of course there would need to be more in a more narrative-heavy game, but I'd argue that in most 3D Zeldas there would have needed to be at least some [had they had a female option]."
