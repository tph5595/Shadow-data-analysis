18376,Can you explain this to me please?
18656,Zelda games *are* open world though. I don't understand this. Especially Twilight Princess. The only non open world ones I can think of are Triforce Heroes and Four Swords as they are level based.

18918,"Are you the same guy that did that other comment, or did you steal this?"
19000,I don't personally think it means anywhere from the start. But you can certainly go places you aren't necessarily *supposed* to. That's what open world means to me. 
23606,"I see your point, but I still disagree. Sure, certain points are locked without the needed item, but I think what makes it open is that once you get to those places, you can still go back and forth freely whenever you want. And the game never forces you in one direction. When you first get to Hyrule Field in Ocarina, sure you're *supposed* to go to castle town, but (and correct me if I'm wrong) you don't *have* to. You can explore Lake Hylia or Lon Lon Ranch. It is definitely an open world."
24401,"I see what you mean now, and I agree with you. You have to do things in a certain order. Like, you can go places, but you can't do things. And what you consider open would be you can go places *and* do things. But really I'd say that's more of a linear vs non-linear gameplay thing than an open vs non open world thing. Another way to think of it is if the whole world is connected or broken up. Alright, I've made my final argument I think. Thank you for this conversation :)"
