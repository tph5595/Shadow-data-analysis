8879,"I think the rumor of them pushing zelda on to the NX is probably true.  They did the same thing with TP to make sure hardcore fans bought the wii and even released the game a week earlier on the wii.  I was super excited, but felt super bummed when I also kind of felt like they were kind of coercing fans into buying the new platform.  On top of that the controls weren't the best and I felt a bit let down by the whole experience.  I think that if they are going to be releasing a new console that has higher specs, they should make that the focus and stop trying to make the game on both platforms.  At this point, they are only delaying it to make sure that they can get it running on the new platform and get more early adopters on to the platform.  "
