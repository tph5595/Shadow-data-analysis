2606,"As long as you could play as classic-looking Link, why would it bother you if other people didn't?"
2894,"It's not the same, as Link is not *one* character. It's a different Link from game to game except but a few. I too would mind if you suddenly could be female Mario or male Samus, but Link specifically can be anyone."
4454,"Hero's Spirit was a bad idea to begin with. It detracts from the point that Link is a vessel for the player. He did not act like ""my"" imagined Oot-Link so for people like me the timeline is fucked anyway :p 

Also, say that you can chose the gender of Link in the upcoming Zelda and that they later want to use that specific Link like they did with Hero's Spirit? It's not impossible (or even hard) to write around that. It's a decaying skeleton in armor. Design the character in a way so that you can't tell the gender. It wouldn't be a problem it just needs some thought put into it. "
107207,"Why so angry? Calm down :)
Link being a vessel for the player and representing him/her in the game world is something the creators have stated, not something I came up with by myself. "
111010,"Have they said this? He obviously have some minor character traits and a defined place in the world in the later entries in the series, but he's blank enough to still act like a sort of vessel. We know he speaks to the other characters, also roughly what he is conveying, but they leave the wording up to the players imagination. To put it this way, if he's supposed to be a ""real"" character he's not a good one. 

Anyway, all of this is to say that I still really don't see the problem in letting people chose the gender of Link. It would be easy to write around. "
113097,"&gt; And have you ever played a game where gender is ""written around""?

Well Link isn't written, is he? :p If they had wanted to change his gender in any of the games all they would have to do would be changing the model and any gender-specific dialogue like ""boy"" or ""he"". Nothing would feel out of the ordinary except maybe the amount of woman flirting with woman. "
119108,"I disagree. Or at least, that's not something I remember from any of the games. How does, Aryll, for example, treat you like a brother other saying the word ""brother""? Seriously, I checked the script just to be sure, and there's nothing about their defined relationship that says it HAS to be a brother/sister-relationship. It could just as easily been a sister/sister or brother/brother-relationship. She says ""BIG BROTHER!!!"" an awful lot, but that could just as easily been ""BIG SISTER!!!"". "
