43753,"Zelda 1 is open world, you can go anywhere and do any dungeon in any order. Same with a link between worlds cus of the item system. 

But the 3d Zelda's aren't the same kind of open world. Some areas are blocked off, and you're still forced to do everything in a linear path. It's especially not open world like western open world games where you can go anywhere whenever (Skyrim). "
