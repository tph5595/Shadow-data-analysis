16052,Clich√© Disney-esque accents like in Hyrule Warriors would ruin it. Greatly.
16092,Nah I think they're going to make it open world and have loads of side quests. I am expecting a side quest journal.
16201,Friends is generous. Zelda routinely uses Link. In SS she even admits it.
16309,"This is probably legit but the tweets make it sound like real media is going to leak. Is that the case or are we just getting snippets?

And I hate leaks. I hate them. This isn't a good way to find stuff out. E3 is going to have a great video and loads of information. Nintendo are the lords of hype. This is just shit. A bunch of game 'journalists' trying to get attention. They're not even able to monetise this."
18804,no they are not. open world doesn't mean big open world. open world means you can go anywhere and do anything form the start. zelda worlds are routinely hindered by your abilities/inventory.
