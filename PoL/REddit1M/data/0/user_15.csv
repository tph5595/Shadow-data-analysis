i love it"
6458,i'd be more impressed if it was zelda fitzgerald
6655,"sorry! i forgot to give you your memo, but basically options now means that the bad guys win and sjws come to your house and literally steal your childhood

i do love how people that complained in the past of how restrictive nintendo was with some of their games are now complaining of such a simple thing"
6716,"isn't it so weird that after years of drama involving leaks, that we know nothing except that it exists? what a strange time this is"
10841,"How is that bad exactly? Different choices leading to different experiences sound exactly like something that should happen, not something to fear."
14209,"Every zelda game except for skyward sword (i'm probably forgetting one) would be the same story-wise if Link was a girl. The only thing that has Link being male is that he was always male.

having different genders wouldn't really change much unless you're going for a romantic angle. "
16207,"you're right! i forgot ruto and nabooru. the other sages would remain unchanged though. 

let's run through the other games because i don't want to get back to work:

LTTP - no change

OOT - ruto and nabooru changes, the rest is the same

MM - no change

WW - no change

TP - tough one. outside of the end credits where twili midna says ""you can't talk because of how pretty i am"", there wouldn't be a change. does that count? i feel like it shouldn't since it's such a minor change and it's after the whole game

SS - yeah tons of change

PH - no change

ST - no change

Oracle of Season - no change

Oracle of Ages - no change

ALBW - no change

I ain't played the others or just don't remember enough of them to comment"
16812,And I think you're placing far too much importance on how changing the gender would fundamentally change a game.
