For example, recently this girl said a new Paper Mario is coming to Wii U. Her guess was half right as it was for 3DS instead. 

She's had a few lucky guesses and people say she's ""reputable"". Nobody bothers to recall when she was wrong, which is a lot of times. 

But in the unlikely event that Nintendo of Japan caved in to Western ""Your established IP has to be a female or a female option I can relate to it even though I won't play it anyway"" beliefs, then congrats, your low-hanging rumor came to fruition! Nobody else ever thought about it! So reputable!"
