5712,"Mario's a blank slate, but I really doubt that we'll have a Mario Wii U/NX with Maria, the gender-swapped Mario. Now I could see Linkle in some form, or going back to Mario, the Mario Bros. long-lost sister Maria, but I really doubt we'll have a button that let us choose between genders of an already androgynous character.

Keep in mind that Commander Shepard and the Pokemon and Fable protagonists are both 1) created with the idea of two genders from the start and 2) are fully customizable. This Link is pretty much like every other Link-- because yeah, blank slate-- so there's no reason to think Nintendo will start doing this (and voice acting in the same game). Hell, are we going to see a gender-swapped Zelda, too?"
6948,"...and? No, really. I don't see your point. You can change Link's name. So...? How does this give levity to gender-swapping?"
8927,"No, I'm pretty sure Link has always been a blond/brown-haired blue-eyed pointy-eared young man. Just because you name him Lucina doesn't suddenly make him a blue-haired girl from the future. He's what the narrative tells you he is, only he is supposed to be a stand-in for you (read: not exactly like you). 

In Ocarina of Time, he's a villager in a village of kids, in Twilight Princess he's a farm boy, in Skyward Sword he's a student. Link lacks just enough personality traits so you can stand in for him, but he has enough to him for a semblance of a backstory, personality, and role in the plot. Otherwise the game's story (or lack thereof sometimes) wouldn't work."
9446,"Yeah, except it wouldn't be Link.

Like I said, it's like making Mario into Maria. There's *technically* no reason why they can't, except no one would like it except the super hardcore change-for-the-sake-of-change crowd. Hell, why not set the series in space, make him fly an Arwing and turn it into *Star Wars*?

And let's be honest, like Link not being a girl actually affects anyone's preference in the series. ""Gee, I'd play that Zelda game if that blond haired kid (looked like he, because as if they'd actually show it and he doesn't look androgynous enough) had a vagina."""
10032,"1) If they were to make Link female, he'd have to change enough for it to actually mean anything. As I said before, he's already androgynous (for those who don't know, that's someone who doesn't look too far on either sex) and if they just SAY he's a girl and change literally *nothing* it'd be pointless.

2) Gee, why even have gendered characters then if their gender isn't fundamental to their *actual design*? I've already mentioned *Maria*, how about *Mistress Chief*, *Luke Croft*, hey, let's genderflip Zelda and Ganondorf while we're at it. There's *technically* no reason they can't!"
