58157,"What about a subversion of the prophesied holders of the triforce? Everyone expects a Hylian clad in green and raised in a sleepy village to become the Hero of Courage, and a gerudo mystic/thief king to claim the triforce of power.

Who says a Gerudo can't be a descendant of Link, and bear a traditional Gerudo name like Ganondorf? And who says a Hylian can't be a reincarnation of Demise? If we think of this as possible, then we could very easily see a game starring a ""young Ganondorf."""
