I'd also like to see a game starring Zelda during the 7 years where link is asleep in Ocarina of Time. I feel like the fall of Hyrule and Zelda's return would be super sick, plus we might see the events of Ocarina from Zelda's perspective."
18594,I love it.

I love me some Link just as much as the next guy, but when you break it down his only responsibility is to waggle his sword at the things everyone else is too afraid to fight. Zelda has to rule an entire kingdom! (And she can whoop some ass herself)"
