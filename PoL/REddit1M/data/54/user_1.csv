18763,"Story mode like regular, just link is evil and the side bosses before fighting Link could be a Goron, a Deku, and a Zora


The three powers he gets from the goddesses could augment his abilities

Din gives him fire damage 

Faeore increases attack speed

 Nayru a rebound damaging shield (5%?)
