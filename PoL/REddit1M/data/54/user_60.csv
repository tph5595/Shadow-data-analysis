31850,"This kind of inspired me to an idea:

A link and ganondorf raised together, knowing their fates. With their triforce pieces. They're friends but everyone is worried about what ganondorf will become as they know the prophecies.

But, as they grow from children to adults, Link's courage grows and he starts craving more and more intense feelings. Trying to see the limits of his courage. Pushing others to become more powerful enemies. He knows ganondorf and his respective fates (theoretically) and becomes brasher and crueler, knowing he's ""the good guy""

Whereas ganondorf  grows powerful, powerful in will, determined to show that he's not what everyone thinks he is. He is powerful yes, but wants to prove it for his own merit. His power of will, his power of *good*. His power to break free from the prophecies.

They continue, ganondorf pleading with link to not push. Link ""knowing"" that ganondorf will become evil and then he can truly test his courage, and keeps pushing ganondorf. Tormenting others ganondorf cares about, kidnapping their mutual friend Zelda, who doesn't know WHAT to think.

Ganondorf must fight to become more powerful than the man raised to defeat him. Who's betrayal of the world took everyone by surprise, leaving them the last person they thought would stand up to be a hero.

In the end, demise was right. Their battle continued, but courage isn't always the right choice. Nor power the bad."
