26620,"I'd be okay with this if it was a story of a man's descent to darkness similar to the Star Wars prequels (although hopefully it'd be done better than those bad movies), I don't want Ganondorf to suddenly be a good guy or anything like that. Would probably only work if he starts off the story as a troubled, well-meaning but reluctant hero, later succumbing to greed and using his tribe's poverty and famine as an excuse to gain power through wicked means. The only problem with that are that it'd make the game too story-oriented, which is not what the series is about. I think we'd be better off without something like this."
