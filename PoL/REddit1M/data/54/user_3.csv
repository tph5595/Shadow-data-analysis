2383,I don't really think the formula would be tailored to suit that idea personally. What sort of gameplay would you have?
11769,Hyrule is going to be winning so much that the Gerudo will be sick of winning.

11991,"He wasn't painted as a *good guy* in Wind Waker though, it just gave more exposition as to why he he had the motives he did and he should never be portrayed as some sort of good guy.

Other M should be a good reminder what happens when games paint a character against the assumed traits and personalities of what the fans have filled in. "
13358,It was the last Metroid title and pretty dividing in the community with the overwhelmingly negativity coming from the story and how they portrayed Samus (and gave her a voice actor).
13872,"I kind of figured you knew what it was, my comment was for people who didn't know and yes I would love a new console Metroid game too, it's been eight years since Corruption came out."
15880,"Interesting, I've never heard that perspective before; is there anything in game that leads you to believe that or just your personal belief?

I don't really see Nintendo weaving something like that in one of their games and I don't feel like there's any hinting at it either, that sounds like a plot element from a Metal Gear Solid game.

Either way that is definitely an interesting perspective and something I never even thought about."
17007,"Here are some quotes from the Wind Waker that best illustrate my point.

&gt;*""My country lay within a vast desert. When the sun rose into the sky, a burning wind punished my lands, searing the world. And when the moon climbed into the dark of night, a frigid gale pierced our homes. No matter when it came, the wind carried the same thing... Death. But the winds that blew across the green fields of Hyrule brought something other than suffering and ruin. I coveted that wind, I suppose. It can only be called fate... That here. I would again gather the three with the crests... That I should lay my hand on that which grants the wishes of the beholder... That when power, wisdom, and courage come together, the gods would have no choice but to come down... The power of the gods... The Triforce! He who touches it will have whatever he desires granted! Already, the crest of wisdom is mine... All that remains...*""

&gt;&gt; *""Do you sleep still? Wait! Do not be so hasty, boy... I can see this girl's dreams... Oceans... Oceans... Oceans... Oceans... Oceans as far as the eye can see. They are vast seas... None can swim across them... They yield no fish to catch... What did the King of Hyrule say?... That the gods sealed Hyrule away? And they left behind people who would one day awaken Hyrule?*""

&gt;&gt;&gt;*""How ridiculous... So many pathetic creatures, scattered across a handful of islands, drifting on this sea like fallen leaves on a forgotten pool... What they can possibly hope to achieve? Don't you see? All of you... Your gods destroyed you! I have been waiting for you, boy. For one like you... Yes... For the hero.""*

Just overall he had more dimension to him than he has in any other games where he is simply painted as *bad guy, go kill him*. "
24598,"I see both sides and I thought from a gameplay perspective it was fine (the Phantoon fight was fucking awesome) but it didn't really feel like a Metroid game. 

I didn't find it to be on par with Prime or Super but I found it to be enjoyable. "
27947,"I still love when he says *""Welcome to my castle,""* in Twilight Princess."
28791,I think the one in Four Swords Adventure is a reincarnate of the one from Ocarina of Time.
71945,"There were only three console F-Zero games and GX is one of the best racing games ever made, in my opinion. I don't think they've done enough or perfected the F-Zero franchise yet to start doing stuff like that with it. I'd like to see it have one more console title as a racing game."

168823,But would you be open to Kraid?
