No, *Other M* should be a reminder of what happens when games paint a character against the assumed traits and personalities of what the fans have filled in and doesn't replace it with something better/interesting or execute it well.

Subverting fan expectations can be a good thing; bad direction, terrible writing, and bland voice acting cannot be."
27720,"""Back to"" is perhaps the wrong term, considering the Zelda canon. But in terms of release date, I see what you mean.

Though I have to say, I'm a big fan of either Ganondorf. And finding out that he was basically Zant's god was really impressive. He had a level of power and flair that we hadn't really seen from him in a while. And even though the battle was pretty easy, (which goes for most of the game, sadly) that final battle was really impressive."
