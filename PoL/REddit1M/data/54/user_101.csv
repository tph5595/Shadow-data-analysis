57209,"I can see Ganondorf as some kind of antihero, who is all in for peace and happiness. On his adventure he loses sight of his true goals getting consumed by hatred and power.

They could make it either a fully fledged Zelda game, where you only play Ganondorf. A legit Zelda game where you can play as Ganondorf at the end of certain events (thinking about how Super Paper Mario let you play Bowser in some parts or Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story)."
