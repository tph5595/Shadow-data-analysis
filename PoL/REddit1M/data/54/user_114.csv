It would be tough to loop in with any of the existing games since Ganondorf's antagonist is already established as the good guy.  So I'd say it would have to be set in another instance of a reincarnation outside of any of the other games.  The TP timeline would maybe make the most sense off top of my head.  

So you'd have to start with Ganondorf being born as the 1/1000 or whatever it was with the Gerudo - that's a given.  He'd be raised and trained with every resource the Gerudo has since he's destined to be their leader.  

Or scrap the Gerudo part and just add plot so that he's trained and at least neutral aligned.  

Enter Demise.  Voice in the back of his head that gets stronger as he gets older.  There's some kind of blight or otherwise bad guy threatening Hyrule.  Vaati maybe.  Maybe he's even taken over the royal family and is ruling the land making life rough.  Ganondorf takes on the responsibility to defeat Vaati or whoever.  But as you progress through the game and defeat dungeon bosses or through some other idea of Ganondorf getting magic instead of items...either way - Demise's essence inside absorbs energy and grows more powerful and more influential.  

Ganondorf resists the darkside as much as he can.  But at some point the plot and his heritage is revealed to him, maybe by the main baddie.  Ganondorf is torn, he's supposed to be the incarnation of evil?  

Link and Zelda have to make some kind of contribution.  From a ""appeal to players"" standpoint, you can't make them bad guys compared to Ganondorf at this point.  Especially since Ganondorf, Link, and Zelda are all going to have the same end goal - restore peace to Hyrule.

Plot happens and the big bad is defeated...but with his defeat Demise absorbs the massive amount of energy.  Internal struggle between Ganondorf and Demise.  Demise manifests outside of Ganondorf.  

Final exciting battle of co-op between Ganondorf with the triforce of power, Link with the triforce of courage, and Zelda with the triforce of wisdom.  

Climactic battle with Demise.  Triforce is united.  Zelda attempts to hold Demise back with magic.  Link courageously throws himself at Demise.  Both of these bought enough time for Ganondorf to get between Demise and the Triforce.  He holds back Demise just in time to touch the Triforce himself.  Without malice and darkness in his heart, his wish to rid the world of Demise is realized. 

The goddesses can now ""kill"" Demise or otherwise banish him from existence.  Cameo of Hylia would be really cool at this point.  With the incarnation of evil completely destroyed we see the master sword lose it's glow and become a typical sword.  Something something about the prophecy being fulfilled and while there will always be bad in the world true evil is gone.  The Triforce gets sealed away in the sacred realm and with it there, no more cycles of reincarnation.  

Nintendo, if you see this and want to run with it, feel free to take it.  Maybe mail me a new Nintendo NX when it comes out.  "

See I think this would be a really awesome opportunity to break the cycle because it would be something that's never been done before.  There were several times when Link and Zelda worked directly together to fight against Ganon/Ganondorf but having all three of them working together against Demise directly... I think that's a cool opportunity to do it.  All 3 reincarnations, even the evil power one, working together would be really neat and powerful.  And with the Triforce granting your heart's true desire - Ganondorf in this story would have been plagued by Demise directly.  Sure he wants peace and order restored to Hyrule but more than that he wants peace for himself.  

As far as dealing with Link being a hero and not being the main character...I think you're spot on - it'd absolutely be a different kind of game.  But I think the fact that Zelda games typically play out like interactive stories I think this could still work out pretty well.  "
