45404,"I would love if they marketed it as a new game, with no title relation to the Zelda series.

""Unwritten: The denied prophecy"" or something like that. Still market it as a high fantasy game, stylized, nintendo-first party. But let people make the connections themselves until the first trailers are released, and then the character reveal happens, and the world collectively loses its tits."

45794,"What? How? He's just immortal? 

I always interpreted it as since the gerudo gave birth to a male every hundred years, every time that happened it was a new Ganondorf."

46008,THIS.

This made me laugh more than it probably should've."
46465,"They all say he was ""revived"" though. Would that mean they took his corpse and brought it back from the dead? Or does it mean he just is ressurected as a different one?"
46670,"Have it take place right before OoT. Have the Gerudo in plight, and have him appointed as the only one with the power to save them, then he goes marauding around for strength, all leading up to his plan  to steal from the castle by deceiving the king of Hyrule. That's when he starts to realize just how powerful he is, and slowly descends into madness. He kills Link, and then the rest of the game is a rampage through happytown, with pitiful 'heroes' falling to you left and right until you conquer the land, almost like ""Overlord"" or something."

47071,I guess I always just thought that him being sealed away just meant his 'spirit' or whatever you want to call it was able to make it out and possess another soul down the line.
