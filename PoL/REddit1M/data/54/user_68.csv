Kind of like Assassin's Creed Rogue in concept of switching sides, but to where you gradually get worse and worse.


The corruption of evil characters is always described but I can't think of an instance where you actually live it as the main character.


Obviously in the context of Zelda it would have to be a bit tamed down unfortunately, although I secretly would love an over the top game. "
