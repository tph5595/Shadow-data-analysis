14634,I've long thought of how the universe of F-Zero could be used for other genres than just the racing. It could be made into a great bounty hunting game where Captain Falcon could catch master criminals alongside many side characters. Having him travel between different planets with cuts of racing and streetbrawling I think it'd end up being amazing. This also makes me think Metroid could also be used for other genres too and not just a Samus Metroidvania.
