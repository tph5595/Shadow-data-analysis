50076,"If you wanna do it right you start with Gannondorf as a young man, in the barren wasteland that the garudo live in. You set him up as the apprentice of the current leader and introduce the player to their plight, have them attempt to strike a deal with the hyrule people for a chance at some of their fertile lands, but have the deal rejected. 

You can use the rejection of what in our eyes should be a reasonable offer to build resentment towards the hyrule people. Zelda does snooty highborn people extremely well so if you go that route with the hyrule official that will go a long way to make hyrule unlikable. 

Next you have Gannondorf look for an alternate way to save the gerudo, and that can play out in 3 ways, either there is no other way, so he has to turn his sights on hyrule. There is a way but someone in hyrule either deliberately or not snatches it away. Or he finds that the only way is the triforce.

Now you set him on a path to trick the king the king of hyrule into giving him access to the triforce, not for selfish gains but for the tribe! You have to act as the kings humble servant despite everything they did to the gerudo, but you do it, you bear the humiliation for the tribe. When the time finally comes to make your move you let the princess escape instead of killing her, making a show of chasing her to not appear weak. You let the young boy coming to her help go as well, you are here for your tribe, not to kill children.

Then the way to the triforce is opened and you finally have the power you need to save your tribe. 

At this point you can end the story, or you can start showing how the triforce changes him, slowly eroding his humanity and changing his motives from a misguided attempt to save his people, to a never ending quest for more power.

I would say there could be a pretty descent story in there :) A few years ago I might have given it a crack, but I'm over my fanfiction days.

**RL;DR Gannondorf wants to save his tribe from starvation, when Hyrule won't help he goes after the triforce. The triforce of power then corrupts him.**"
