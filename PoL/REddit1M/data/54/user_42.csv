I thought it was natural for her to obey his commands, especially considering it was part of the terms she agreed to when joining their mission. She still has a sense of justice, she's not gonna say ""fuck you"" to the GF. She's not a space pirate, she's a bounty hunter, and you can have bounty hunters that aren't pieces of shit. She respects authority. She respects Adam as a leader, thus, she respected his opinion to not let her use all of her weapons at the beginning.

And another thing is people complaining about the voice actress and the ""monotone monologues."" The people complaining about that are the same people who talk about how Samus is stone cold and stuff. Well, a person who is ""stone cold"" would probably speak in a monotone voice. And the monologues? We saw that in Fusion multiple times, yet no one seemed to have a problem with it there. And in most of the other Metroid games, Samus doesn't have lines for a reason. In most of the games in the series, she's alone, isolated. Who's she gonna talk to? The Geemers? The only reason people seemed to think she was this silent badass is because she was never really in a situation where she needed to say anything. Put her in the company of others, and what, is she just supposed to not respond? And don't use Corruption as a counter-example. Was there ever really a point in there where someone asked her a direct question that would warrant a verbal response from Samus? No, most of the sentences directed at her were someone ordering her to do something or telling her to go somewhere.

Honestly, I see no reason for people to hate Other M. It just doesn't make sense. My only complaint was that it was kinda short and that's it.

Edit: Realized it was Old Bird who was her Chozo father figure, not Grey Voice."

64119,"I'll agree that the Varia suit thing was a bit ridiculous but it's not a big a deal as you're making it to be. It's not like you, the player, were actually burning up, so why do you care so much? So you take a little damage, who cares?

I also can't say a whole lot about the Ridley thing other than a personal theory of mine: in all of the other games Samus knows she's facing the space pirates, so she kind of expects Ridley to be there. It's the fact that in Other M, she doesn't think Ridley is gonna show up and when he does, that's what shocks her. Also, she was probably under the impression that he was really dead with no chance of recovery, so when a clone came back it really screwed with her head. Another thing is that, I feel like if they had the capabilities to produce such a cutscene in like Super Metroid, showing Samus's fear of Ridley, they would have put it in there but they didn't. In fact there really was no story explained in game in the first couple entries to the series other than opening text and stuff in the instruction manual, so you can't use those games as reasons why she isn't fazed by Ridley. I suppose in the Prime games, they could have done a ""scared Samus"" cutscene, but they didn't. I got nothing there except for the answer, different Dev team.

Last thing I want to mention is ""the baby"" and how it relates to what you said about her voice. That Metroid was the closest she's ever been to having a child and being a mother. The thing saved her damn life! Of course she's gonna feel a little defeated and downtrodden in the game that takes place RIGHT after that happened. So yeah, she's bummed and the voice acting reflects it which I think works very well, yet when she needs to she still sounds like a badass in some of her more heroic scenes in Other M."
70822,"I don't think either us have been in a near death situation only to have our lives saved as the last second thanks to someone else, but I feel like such an event would make a bigger impact than you think. Makes sense why Samus would see the baby in a different light. Think about the girl who never really had a mother, meets this specimen who believes it's her child, saves her life, and dies immediately after as a sacrifice of sorts? And are you still gonna say that's something she should shrug off as if it were a pet that ran away?

And I'm sorry but what did they do in Super Metroid that so clearly characterizes Samus as a badass? She didn't have any lines, any cutscenes, nothing. How can you so adamantly say that it portrayed her as a strong, capable, badass woman when in game, it gave her just as much character development as the original Metroid did. She was in her suit the whole damn time! Except when she dies, but that's not very empowering is it? Does nothing to showcase the fact that she's a woman who's strong. It makes her out to be a hunter, which is exactly what she is, but don't forget that she's also human so don't treat her like a robot, devoid of emotion."
71006,"There's not many of us out there, that's for sure lol"
72684,"Showing Samus in a bikini at the end of every game doesn't do a whole lot to make her look like a badass. It reveals she's a woman, yeah, but there's not much beyond that except for ""oh cool that's pretty neat."" 

The early games show that she's strong. But they do not make it explicitly clear that she's a woman. The only way you'd know that in Metroid is if you put in Justin Bailey or beat the game in less than an hour.

Samus *is* a badass woman, but don't pretend it was the first couple games that made her into what we know her as today. That was mostly the Primes, Fusion, Zero Mission, and for those who don't ignorantly block it out of their memory, Other M.

And thanks for saying you give up, I was getting tired of this squabble."
