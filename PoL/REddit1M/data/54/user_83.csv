48165,"I had written this some time ago, good luck and happy reading:

Shortly after the formation of the alliance, before the birth of Zelda, Ganondorf and Link, the man who would be Links' father became close with a Gerudo warrior. They fought beside one another in the great purging of evil, which saw the reclaiming of the Hyrule territory.

The two became very close one evening, leading to the conception of a child. Unplanned pregnancy was forbidden by the Gerudo, so the Gerudo warrior was forced to flee. The Hylian man helped to faked her death on the battlefield and she hid in his home on the outskirts of Hyrule castle.

They were unable to consult a doctor, and with limited birthing experience, she did not survive the birth, however her son did. Unbeknownst to the Hylian of the importance of a male Gerudo, he raised the child as his own, claiming to have found an abandoned child on his travels.

Several years later, the man eventually took a Hylian as his wife and she bore him a second son, Link. Around this time, Princess Zelda was also born. There was much fanfare and celebration as the Royal blood line was spreading thin.

The Hylian man watched his first born grow. An aggressive boy and a natural fighter like his warrior mother, the man thought it best to train him to fight and enlisted Young Ganondorf into the Hylian army as soon as he appeared of age. He passed on his own sword, shield and armor as was the Hylian tradition.

Link was spared recruitment from the army, due to the old Hylian rule ""give up one son to protect the people, give up the rest to the people, of whom to protect"". Link was much more placid and worked with his mother on the farm, rearing animals, sowing the earth and tending to crops. Link occasionally joined in with Ganondorf's training session out of awe of his older brother, whom he held in high regard.

The days of the alliance war were now long gone, the army was now only needed for patrol and to ward off the occasional beast from the outskirts of Hyrule. As a result, the armies grew lazy and dwindled to minimum required numbers. All except for that of the Gerudo, who maintained a strong army presence due to their fighting nature.

Upon Zeldas coming of age ceremony, she was granted access to the great Hylian archives. Always interested in academia, the young princess became absorbed in the literature, often camping in the library for days at a time. She came across an old damaged book written in ancient Hylian and deciphered as best she could. Zelda learned of the coming of the Gerudo King every 100 years, and suspected the Gerudo of maintaining their army in preparation of his return, when they could assume control of Hyrule.

Her suspicions were refuted by her father, claiming the tales to be just that. Studies had shown the Gerudo incapable of bearing a son. Begrudgingly she obliged to his wishes for silence on the matter but continued her research, locking herself away in the great library, becoming consumed with her desire for more knowledge.

A Young Link continued to live in his brothers shadow. Ganondorf was becoming a legend in his own right, not content with the mere border defense of his great land, he would often venture unaccompanied into the dark lands to seek out the enemy and destroy them where they lived and grew.

One day Link decided to follow his brother on a quest into the dark lands. He was quite capable of masking his presence and covering his tracks, having worked the land an becoming a proficient hunter in his childhood. Ganondorf came across a stronghold, the size of which he had never seen before. It was clear that the enemy was planning an attack, one which Ganondorf could not hope stop alone.

Ganondorf was spotted by a dark scouting party which was just returning from Hyrule and was eventually captured by the overwhelming number of dark creatures pouring from the stronghold. Link watched on in horror, unable to save his own brother.

Link was pinned to his hiding location for fear of attracting attention if he dared leave. Not long after Ganondorf was subdued an army of dark creatures marched from the fortress with Hyrule as their destination.

Link took the opportunity to sneak into the enemy camp. He stealthily took down a few of the remaining guards and rescued Ganondorf. They cleared the remainder of the enemy units and hurried off to Hyrule.

Zelda had not slept in days. After uncovering several references to the triforce, she read tirelessly until eventually discovering a direct documentation of the triforce.

Links and Ganondorf arrive only to find their hometown ablaze, with villagers fighting monsters in the streets. The alliance has been alerted but are still on their way, only the Hylians have yet responded to the threat. Link and Ganondorf hurry to their home only to find it too destroyed, their mother slain and their father fatally wounded.

In a fit of rage, Ganondorf blindly lashed out at the shadowy figures nearing them. Zelda arrives, with her personal guard to assist until the alliance is ready, only to see Ganondorf fighting her men with the dark forces in tow. Her accusations have now been confirmed.

She attacks Ganodorf, accusing him of being the Gerudo king and having joined forces with the dark creatures to reclaim the triforce of power. Zelda is quickly taken by her guard before Ganondorf is able to counter.

Ganondorf and Link escape the allied forces. Ganondorf tells of his confrontation with Zelda. Link reveals his fathers dying words, that Ganondorf is the son of a Gerudo.

Zelda takes command of the allied forces upon their arrival, convinced that the Gerudo are in league with the enemy, she quickly compels the leaders of the other allied races to launch a pre-emptive strike on their Gerudo allies, before they are able to join forces with the attacking creatures.

Link and Ganondorf witness the slaughter of the Gerudo, alongside the dark army. They decide to search for the triforce of power and courage so that they may protect themselves long enough to prove Ganondorfs innocence and then combine them with the triforce of wisdom to wish their villages back

They ventured back into the dark lands, razing a path of destruction along the way. Their goal, the main stronghold of the dark creatures, where the triforce of power has been kept awaiting one who could harness it. The stronghold was slaughtered and the triforce of power shone brightly on Ganondorf's hand.

Immediately, Ganondorf's sword burnt in his grasp, recognising the evil that his thirst for power had let in. Ganondorf feigned interest in a nearby trident, still attached to a fallen dark creature, so as not to alert Link, who then took up his fathers sword in Ganondorf's stead.

Now completely at loss of where to go next, Ganondorf started receiving visions of different locations. As the visions became clearer, he could tell that he had never visited them before, but sensed their importance.

Slowly and unkowingly being consumed by Demise's hatred, he used the memories to guide them to the location of the triforce of courage, and the trials to be completed by Link in order for him to prove his courage and be considered worthy. With both pieces of the triforce secured, Ganondorf was ready to complete the triforce to bring darkness to the land, now desiring vengeance for his lost tribe. They returned to Hyrule, where Zelda lay in wait.

In the meantime, Zelda had attained the triforce of Wisdom and with it, she could see the error of her ways. That she was wrong about Ganondorf, however due to her own actions, he had become the very monster she was trying to stop. She foresaw a direct war against Ganondorf would only cause him to muster the dark creatures as his own, and feed him more power. So she placed her faith in Link.

A lone Zelda attacked the pair as they neared the outskirts of Hyrule. She was no match for their combined strength and was easily defeated.

Link began to explain their story, not taking in any of her absurd mutterings. However Ganondorf interjected and struck Zelda a fatal blow, taking her piece of the triforce as his own.

This act awakened Link to the truth of what his brother had become, to his slow descent into evil. He stood tall and raised the master sword high. It now shone brightly with the power to repel evil. A confused Ganondorf, who had intentionally avoided helping Link to restore its full power, realised that it was Zeldas doing. With her dying breath she had chanted the blessings needed to give Link the power to defeat him. And with his final actions, Ganondorf had sealed his own fate.
