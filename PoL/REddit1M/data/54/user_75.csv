45733,"I know that zelda games don't have alternative endings, but it would be cool to have. My idea is that when Gannon tries to take control of Gandorf everybody would know about it. This would make him an outcaast.
Players could either choose to battle against gannon and get trust from other races and saving the sages, or he could kill those sages and help Gannon cause.
This would create more possible ending to player. We could have dungeons where our enemies could be races that we usually are friends with like Zoras and Gorons.

Any opinions?

Ps. Sorry for my bad English it isn't my native tongue."
