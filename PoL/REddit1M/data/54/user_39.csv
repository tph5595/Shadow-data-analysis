22566,"Wow! A story in which the reincarnation of Ganondorf has to resist the evil pull of Demise/Ganon is brilliant! Make it so that each of the dark generals has captured a sage, and you'd be set. Could the Master Sword, after eons of opposing the Triforce of Power, resist young Ganondorf's grasp? Since there's often two sets of collection arcs (e.g. Gems and Emblems in OoT), Ganondorf must first prove himself pure and worthy of the Master Sword by completing three quests and collecting tokens from each of the Great Fairies. Once collected, he would be seen as truly worthy by the Sword. Then with the Blade of Evil's Bane in hand, he would have the power to destroy each of the Dark Generals and rescue the sages. 

Ooo! I can see this game being all about power! What does one do with great power once attained? Can our unlikely hero resist being corrupted by power? Is Power alone enough to win, or do you also need Wisdom and Courage? And can one find the power to overcome history and fate to forge one's own future? 

I bet throughout his journey, a number of monsters would try to either pledge their allegiance to Ganondorf or try to turn him to the dark side. Can he have a Poe (in the form of a Will-o-the-Wisp/hitodama) as his guide instead of a Fairy? And have one of the Dark Generals be a ghoulish resurrected Twinrova who, as Koume and Kotake, tries to convince Ganondorf that he can't escape his destiny.

Once Ganondorf defeats the final Dark General, he returns to the castle to find that Link and Zelda have been captured by Beast Ganon. We've seen Puppet Ganon and Puppet Zelda as bosses in past games. Here we finally face Puppet Link. After freeing Link, the two of them rescue Zelda side by side (Link would act as a CPU aiding in fighting giant hordes, like Magnus in Kid Icarus Uprising). Of course she's being used as bait, but they free her during the penultimate boss battle. But the final battle would be legendary: the heroic Ganondorf vs. the Beast Ganon. Ganon has retreated to the realm of shadows where he is most powerful. Only Ganondorf can follow and destroy the evil, as he is fighting his own destiny/legacy. But before he goes, Link and Zelda lend him their pieces of the Triforce, giving him the power to destroy the great evil of Demise/Ganon once and for all. Upon entering the realm of shadows, the Beast calls him a fool for delivering the complete Triforce right to him, and says that once he kills our hero he'll take possession of his soulless corpse and the Triforce. Ganondorf fights for his life in the present, his ancestors used by evil forces in the past, and his legacy in the future!"

And btw, I like the name Council of Eight. It fits really well!"
