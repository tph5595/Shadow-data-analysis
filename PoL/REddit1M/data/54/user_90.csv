52663,"Maybe a game where Ganon is a young go getter who is pretending that all he wants is peace and happiness, but he is pursuing the piece of the triforce and all that are in his way keep disappearing. At the end, you playing a second or right hand minion of his, confront him about his true ambitions, and even though you lose, you manage to give him a weakness that can be exploited by an actual hero before you are killed by Ganon. That might be a bit too meta, but I would play the crap out of such a game. "
