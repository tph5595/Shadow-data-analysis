30057,"In order for the player to connect with ganondorf, give them a valid reason to agree with his motivations. I'm drawing a creative blank as to what those would be, but I would feel a little weird destroying and taking over an entire kingdom just because it's in my nature or I'm destined to do so."
30325,"When you think about The Legend of _Zelda_ enough, it's hard not to imagine what it would be like from Zelda's perspective, so it's logical to then wonder the same about Ganondorf. But to be honest, I hadn't thought of this either in the ~15 years I've been playing. "
30773,"Actually, this might make it more interesting. What if Ganondorf connects with his past selves for advice? Well... thinking about it, I don't know if this makes a whole lot of sense.

Maybe he connects with the spirits of his past selves in such a way so their bodies don't remember the interactions later. The excuse as to why Link can become a spirit and come back with memories of it could be that there has to be a memory disconnection for the interaction to transcend time.

Yeah! Yeah?

Edit: By ""past self"", I mean literally himself but in the past."

78123,Right. This was implied in the comment you replied to. 
78815,"&gt; The main character doesn't have to be a good guy!

I agree. If he was painted as a good guy from the game's frame of reference, then I imagine it would be kinda lame. It would work, but not nearly as well as the alternative. Now, if he was painted as a good guy from _his_ perspective, even though it's obvious he's not, then that could be interesting. Or, he could know and embrace that he's a bad guy, but he is unknowingly acting out of tremendous fear that he's buried so deep it's almost irretrievable.

The basic motivational mechanism of always taking actions that you believe to be of your greatest benefit, even if you can intellectually confirm that more positive actions would be even more so (which Ganondorf could not due to buried fear), would still be in place. You should be able to see _why_ he takes the evil actions he takes so you're not just running around slashing good guys because the game says you have to."
