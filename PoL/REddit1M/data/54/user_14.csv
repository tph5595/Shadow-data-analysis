10611,"(I've taken large liberties with somewhat established canon to try to build a cohesive story plot. Any holes you can poke through this is accepted and even appreciated. I just wanted to share something that popped into my head after checking out this AWESOME fanart)

Far into the timeline where Ganon was sealed away (yes, the one with WindWaker and the other cell shaded games) a young male Gerudo-like infant is born. This particular instance of the world has known peace for many years. Princess Zelda has kept the peace between all nations with her royal council: the 6 Sages, one of each race, and the Hero of the Realm, this world's Link. The ruling body was called The Council of Eight. (I'm tired and can't think of anything better. What would you name this group of leaders?) 

For the last several years, some of the Sages have been getting premonitions of a great evil fighting its bonds, trying to escape the prison it was sealed into: Ganon was flexing his powers once more. They had heard the legends about the terrible powers of the Prince of Darkness, King of Evil, but they had also known of the legends that a Hero of Legends would always appear, bearing the Triforce of Courage, to face against this threat, who always bore the Triforce of Power. Together with the Triforce of Wisdom, which had been passed down generations through the Royal line, Courage and Wisdom would always triumph over Power, who sought to conquer the three pieces of the Triforce and rule the realm. 

But then Ganondorf was born, and shown to have the Triforce of Power within him. Through the ages, Power was always born before Courage or Wisdom, so this was a strange turn of events. The Council of Eight, with permission from the boy's family, took upon themselves the upbringing of the young Ganondorf at a young age, to keep an eye on the boy who, they believed, would turn into the Dark Lord Ganon. 

Months turned into years. Years into decades. Ganondorf was a young adult and now a respected member of the royal family, having been adopted into the halls of the Hylian court. A tall, muscular man with a strong face and stronger gaze, but whose heart held kindness that the name of Ganondorf rarely ever held. He grew up having been tutored by the greatest scholars of the world, coached by Link himself in the art of the sword and war, history by Princess Zelda herself. He had been a part of the royal guard, the apothecary, the kitchen, the servants, builders, farmers, all aspects of Hylian life, all so that he could appreciate what it was to be a valued and respected member of society. Sometimes, he would given the stink eye, but some who believed he might sprout another head, one shaped like a boar, and start rampaging through the countryside, but most other Hylians, as well as the other races of the land, knew of the young Ganondorf, Young Ward of Hyrule. 

Zelda and Link, long time friends, were well into their adult years, nearing the twilight of their time. Princess Zelda, wise beyond measure, a just and noble ruler, adored by all. Lord Link, the paragon of courage, unmatched in single combat for many years and thought throughout the realm as the greatest swordsman who ever lived. The grey in their hair and the wrinkles on their faces only improved their noble features. But the fact of the matter was thus: they were past their prime. 

Which is when Ganon struck.

The monsters of the realm, normally quite pleased to keep to themselves, started acting stranger and more feral than normal. The trees and foliage of the forests and plains started to wither slowly but surely. Ghosts and the undead seemed to appear nearly overnight, and a darkness fell over the land of Hyrule. And during this time, the young Ganondorf was fighting for his life. 

King Ganon was trying to posses Ganondorf's body, the vessel who's path he had set in motion years before the birth of even Link or Zelda. He had planned this out to the day. He would arrive suddenly, from within the court of Hyrule, and take over the kingdom of Hyrule from within. And who who suspect the noble Ganondorf, whom people thought of as royalty? It was a perfect plan, and it would have gone off without a hitch. 

Had Ganondorf himself not known of this. And he wanted no part of Ganon's ploy. 

Ganondorf's experiences growing up as a member of Hyrule, as someone who loved and shared his love with everyone, were stronger than the forces of Evil that Ganon was trying to exhume over him. Zelda and Link, after finding young Ganondorf nearly incapacitated by his internal struggle with Ganon, used their powers of Courage and Wisdom to keep the Dark Lord at bay, and saved Ganondorf from Ganon. 

For now....

Zelda and Link had to use every ounce of their energy to keep Ganondorf free from Ganon's control. Once able to move again, Ganondorf met with the rest of the Council of Eight to devise a plan to seal away Ganon once and for all, using all three pieces of the Triforce wielders together with the Triforce itself. If a wish could be made with all three wielders of Triforce together, as one, it might throw Ganon away for good. But Ganon was too strong right now to do that. Ganondorf had to go and out and defeat Ganon's generals, sources of Ganon's power in the physical realm, to lessen his hold on the world. He set out with blessings from the Council of Eight, who each gave him an item that would help him (can't think of specific items for the six sages right now), Zelda gave him the Great Bow of Light, and Link passed him his own sword, but not before telling Ganondorf that he may need to seek out the sword of evil's bane, the Master Sword. With his items in tow, he left the castle. In his travels, he would find more weapons and items to use, and discover an affinity with a particular polearm weapon. He would clear the name of Ganondorf of all association with the Dark Prince of Evil so that the next generation and each generations afterwards would be free from Ganon's grasp forever. "
11439,Thank you kindly. I kinda just got hit with a stroke of insight about how a story about 'Dorf would go and ran with it. Glad you liked it!
11766,"Oooh, a twist would be excellent! Maybe something like one of Ganon's troops push their way into Castle Hyrule while 'Dorf is away and manage to interrupt Zelda and Link's concentration, which allows Ganon to take over 'Dorf's body for a period of time, during which he goes full Beast Boar mode and destroys a village or something. Link and Zelda regain controle, pushing Ganon out of 'Dorf, 'Dorf comes back to his senses, sees what ""he's"" done, and just kinda kneels in the ruins for some time before steeling himself even more against Ganon!

Or something maybe like to be able to truly seal Ganon away, 'Dorf has to make the ultimate sacrifice as well. Maaan, that would the most bitter sweet ending ever."
18987,Thanks :D
23262,"I like how you think!

Every single one of those ideas would work great, and would fit the traditional Legend of Zelda style of gameplay, which is something I didn't really elaborate on, just plot plot plot!

I'm really liking the whole ""proving yourself as worthy of the Master Sword"" bit, making a pilgrimage to the Great Faeries (which will be hard to do, cuz you're Ganondorf. Why would they listen to you?), and then using the three pieces of Triforce in the Realm of Shadows to combat the King of Evil in HIS territory. 

Man, I wish a game like this could become something more than just a fan's pipe dream. It's hard enough getting diverse stories in actual Zelda games, let alone something as left field as this. 

Thanks for the input, being able to share ideas like this is great!"
