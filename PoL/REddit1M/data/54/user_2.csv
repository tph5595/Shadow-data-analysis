1186,"And now I need to change my pants.

Seriously though, that would be amazing. I already love the Dorf in Smash, it would be great to play through a Zelda game as him with a wildly different playstyle and skill set from Link.

And it would give me another use for my gorgeous Dorf Amiibo. The production value on these things is great."

I feel that I should know what this is, but all I have is a gaping hole in my memory...and where did these tears come from?"
13764,"Thanks mate, but I'm (regretfully) aware. My comment was meant to imply that the experience was so horrible that I'd (figuratively) blocked it out entirely.

I knew it was a bad ride going in, but I greatly underestimated just how much of a cunting train wreck it really is.

They'd better give the series another chance (a *real* one, none of this Federation Force bullshit), because the desire is there. They just need to *not fuck it up*. Make a sequel to *Fusion*, there's tons of story potential and fresh new mechanics potential (what with Samus' Metroid DNA) right there."

58711,"&gt;She respects Adam as a leader, thus, she respected his opinion to not let her use all of her weapons at the beginning.

While this is a somewhat valid character choice it's still a poorly contrived reason to limit Samus' power through the game. Losing all weapons at the start of each new game may be cliche by now but it *works*. The player isn't left there knowing that they have all their godly, endgame power enragingly out of reach and entirely at the whim of an NPC. 

Also, Samus is not the type to adhere to such an order in serious life-threatening scenarios. The fact that, for example, she ran around taking heat damage for a while all because Adam didn't explicitly authorize use of the Varia suit is bullshit. I can understand him limiting use of her incredibly powerful weaponry, but something that is dedicated to *protecting* her? Now you're just being an ass, Adam. What possible reason is there for denying her the Varia and Gravity suit features when they are strictly defensive and utilitarian? It makes sense from a game design perspective, but Adam isn't a game designer.

It also make no sense for Adam to still act like she's anything other than an asset to his mission. Samus has, by this point, accomplished truly legendary feats, probably far more than Adam himself. A wise and collected man like himself should have welcomed her assistance and left the utilization of her abilities to her own best judgement. He certainly shows his wisdom at the end of *Fusion*, so I find it incongruous that he wouldn't demonstrate it just a few years prior.

&gt;""monotone monologues.""

The problem with this is that the VA's monotone doesn't sound stone cold, she sounds like someone who has come to the conclusion that life has no meaning and isn't worth living. She sounds like nihilism incarnate. She sounds like she's trying too hard to be cold and emotionless.

Then, when the time comes for her to show emotion, she goes over the top yet again, trying too hard and sounding insincere as a result. Furthermore, the exceedingly emotional, basically PTSD-suffering Samus shown in Other M is so far removed from every other portrayal of Samus that she might as well be another person altogether. Particularly in reference to ""the baby"". Samus remembers its sacrifice fondly in *Fusion* but that's about it.

Take, for example, Samus' breakdown when confronted by Ridley. It makes absolutely no sense whatsoever that she react in such a manner after not only facing but defeating Ridley *four times*. Any unresolved issues, repressed memories, residual trauma, etc should have been dealt with long, long ago.

All of this, and more, leads me to believe that *Other M* would have been much, much better suited as a prequel to the entire series. Samus' wildly shifting emotional states, her breakdown with Ridley and Adam's restrictions would actually make sense if this game took place before she even went to Zebes for the first time, either at the end of her career with the GF or at the beginning of her solo career.

Oh, and one last thing: the plot delivery. It's horrible. We really only started getting consistent plot delivery with the *Prime* games, but they really hit the nail on the head. Metroid has been a series focused on exploration and discovery and the Prime series' organic plot development was *brilliant*. In a game with heavy exploration and discovery elements the plot is gradually uncovered by the player through willful acts of discovery. It was a beautiful step outside the norm and fit the series like a Spandex bodysuit.

*Other M* just forces the plot down the players' throats in Samus' dreadful monotone and flashy cinematic cutscenes."
68797,"&gt;I'll agree that the Varia suit thing was a bit ridiculous but it's not a big a deal as you're making it to be. It's not like you, the player, were actually burning up, so why do you care so much? So you take a little damage, who cares?

Because it doesn't make sense for either character to adhere to their stupid little system in such situations. In a character-driven plot centered around two highly competent and experienced characters you'd expect them to make decisions based on and consistent with that competence and experience. When they don't it shatters suspension of disbelief and, in cases where it negatively affects gameplay, actively frustrates the player.

&gt;I also can't say a whole lot about the Ridley thing other than a personal theory of mine: in all of the other games Samus knows she's facing the space pirates, so she kind of expects Ridley to be there.

Rubbish. She's been surprised by Ridley's presence before and not broken down into a useless piece of garbage. Besides, as I said before, fighting and conquering him so many times before should have gone a long ways towards resolving her Ridley issues *and* her enormous wealth of combat experience should have, at the very least, allowed her to keep her head enough to avoid making herself completely vulnerable.

And I highly doubt they would have included such a scene in Super Metroid. From the very beginning it was all about showcasing Samus as a strong, capable, badass woman, and the fans loved it. Samus was too important to the Nintendo brand back then to try such a risky move. Besides that, it simply wouldn't have *fit* with the rest of the game.

&gt;That Metroid was the closest she's ever been to having a child and being a mother. The thing saved her damn life! Of course she's gonna feel a little defeated and downtrodden in the game that takes place RIGHT after that happened.

""A little"" defeated and downtrodden is all I expected, not the full out ""mother who just lost her dear child"" crap they pulled. 

Samus had barely any time with the baby Metroid. When she left SR388 she promptly handed it off to the GF. When they reunited it almost killed her in its insatiable hunger before ultimately sacrificing its life to Mother Brain. I mean that's certainly enough to create a bond and look back at its sacrifice with fondness, gratitude and regret, but little more. I don't buy that she could have bonded to it to the extent that *Other M* claims she did in the very brief time they spent together."
71569,"&gt; And I'm sorry but what did they do in Super Metroid that so clearly characterizes Samus as a badass?

Well I don't know...maybe *the entire game?* It doesn't need to happen in a fancy cutscene to be relevant to her character. Everything that the player does is representative of Samus' character and capabilities. She is a hardcore badass who braves hostile environments and vicious creatures to overcome tremendous challenges and odds *all by herself*. She has repeatedly thwarted a dastardly criminal organization and arguably saved the universe a couple times. Just because it was in the players' control doesn't mean it isn't who she is and what she's capable of.

&gt;Does nothing to showcase the fact that she's a woman who's strong.

But if you really can't understand how the early games show that she's a strong woman then I give up. That's beyond dense."
