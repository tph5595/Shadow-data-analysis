That's because he doesn't talk to allow the player to feel more connected, and not 'define' Link as just another hero. Also, I don't think the reincarnation cycle can be broken so easily. If it could, I'm sure Link/Zelda would have wished for it to be dissipated at the end of Skyward Sword (but they obviously didn't because there would have been no point in introducing that plot point in the first place)

It's an interesting idea, but execution would be difficult. Also, it's highly unlikely Nintendo will ever really visit this sub, let alone see your post :( I reckon its a good idea for a standalone story though, not just a Zelda game."
