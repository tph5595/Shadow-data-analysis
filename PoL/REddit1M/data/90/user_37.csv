199055,"I am trying to beat Thunderblight Ganon with only 6 hearts and I die every single time in the last phase around 20%. It's my second divine beast (did water first) and every guide I see online has people doing this with the fucking Master Sword + Hylian Shield and all this other mess. I don't have ANY food, or ANY shock resistance gear.

Do I need to just take the L, and go farm gear? If so, where?"
