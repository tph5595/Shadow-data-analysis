Am I allowed to ask Lore questions here?

If so, what is officially canon in the game world? Does this somehow link to the world we have in OoT? Obviously the events of OoT don't actually happen as Link goes back to child form after defeating Ganon, but does BoTW continue in a sense? If yes, how do the landscape changes get explained?
