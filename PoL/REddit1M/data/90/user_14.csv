You sure you don't want to just complete them? A lot of shrines are really short, it's not normally a massive commitment to do one."
46385,"Part of the beauty of it is that you don't really *have* to play any way in particular. Just moving through the world towards whatever looks interesting and working out how you're going to get there is half the fun. This is pretty unusual since you don't always have a clear objective and some people are a little thrown off by that, but having done multiple playthroughs of the game now I've found that you'll generally end up making progress in some form no matter which way you run. Even if you run off to the middle of nowhere, chances are you'll find a shrine, or a tower to unlock a portion of the map, or a couple of enemy camps for some upgrades along the way.

If you're after more hearts and stamina, just going around exploring for shrines and getting lost in the wilderness might be the best thing for you to do right now.

One thing you might have noticed is that the game will sometimes give you a big quest that isn't meant to be done immediately, but tackled over the course of the entire game (like how you were given the quest to ""destroy Ganon"" right at the beginning). This is a bit different to other games that will usually throw a trail of much shorter quests at you which lead you through the game.

I'm reluctant to give specific tips or tricks because I feel like this is one of those games where it really is best to go in blind and discover everything for yourself. Part of the wonder is not knowing exactly what you're meant to be doing. But one thing I'll say is, this game has a pretty elaborate physics engine with detailed environmental interactions, and almost everything in the game is built around that. Many puzzles have multiple solutions and can be solved in very creative ways. If you ever have a crazy idea and think ""I wonder whether this will work"", try it! You might be surprised."
134336,Which divine beasts have you done? It's probably your champion ability coming off cooldown.
136762,"Yeah, it's Mipha then.

In English she says ""Mipha's grace is ready"" every time it comes off cooldown."
151447,"The game is set up in such a way that you're constantly going through a cycle of finding weapons with limited durability, which will then be used during encounters and replaced with new ones. Pretty much every enemy drops the weapon it was holding for you to pick up and use if you can defeat it, but the weapons don't last forever.

It's not everyone's cup of tea (as you've no doubt been reading), but I actually like the system and I think it keeps things fresh. It means that enemies will continue to drop something that's at least useful in some capacity even in the late game, so it mitigates a problem a lot of other open world games suffer from where enemy encounters become redundant once your obtain good enough gear. It exposes you to a lot of different weapon styles and strategies that you might not have otherwise explored, and it adds cool little nuances to combat (enemies being knocked back on the hit a weapon breaks, or throwing it at them for double damage etc).

You'll start off with pretty fragile wooden weapons that will break in a few hits, but by the time you reach endgame you'll be finding weapons that last much longer and you'll end up with more weapons than you know what to do with."
187151,"Yep, that's right. Just don't enter the room towards the top of the castle and you're fine. If you accidentally do enter it and it triggers a cutscene, you can just press the home button and close software like I did when I walked in to it by accident :P"
188455,"It's a relatively simple system - the number next to your weapon is its damage. So in the simplest scenario with no other buffs at play, if you swing a 20 damage weapon against an enemy with 70 health, it now has 50 health.

The number next to clothing is the defense rating, where each point of defense reduces incoming damage by a quarter of a heart. So if you're wearing gear with 4 defense rating, All of your incoming damage is reduced by one heart compared to if you were naked.

Shield ratings are a bit different. Shields with higher numbers will interrupt more attacks and throw enemies off balance more often than shields with lower numbers. For an example: Bokoblins can perform a three-hit combo. If you block with a weak shield like a pot lid, they'll perform all three attacks before returning to their combat stance as if nothing happened. If you block with a strong shield instead, they'll do the first hit then immediately get thrown off balance and become vulnerable.

The durability of an item is never shown as a number on screen, it's invisible until you get the ""this weapon is badly damaged"" message - but you can tell if a weapon/shield is brand new because it'll have a sparkle in the top right of its icon."
229019,Sometimes you'll get a bow that fires multiple arrows at once - but it still only uses one of your arrows from your inventory every time it fires.
230922,"This is the BotW thread, but in Skyward Sword you can repair partially broken shields with that shield repair potion (revitalizing potion I think?). They get destroyed if its durability reaches zero, but you can always buy another."
318971,"Each game has its own standalone story and there are really only vague occasional references to past games, so that's not really necessary at all. You can pretty much play them in any order. It's nothing like wanting to get into Lord of the Rings and starting with Return of the King or anything like that."
485694,"Yep, sounds right."
562861,"Yeah but it doesn't show you a total number on the loading screen or anything like that, which I think is what the question was."
