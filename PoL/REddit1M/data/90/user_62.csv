538613,"I've done all the BOTW quests available to my except the Yuga hideout, where the stealth just kicks my ass every time. I've got the full stealth outfit and everything, is there anything I can do to make it easier for myself or is it just perseverence? I find it really difficult to manage with the camera angles, I wish it went overhead like OoT. At one point I found myself looping back around 3 times in a row and having no idea where to go, even when I could keep track of where the patrols were."
