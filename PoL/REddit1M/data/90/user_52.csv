365057,"So in my quest to master parrying Guardians' beams I have run out of shields. Is there somewhere I can get more easily? I've done all the Divine Beasts and am just about to enter Hyrule castle to fight Ganon.

If that's not possible then is it possible to sneak past all those guardians or am I SOL?"
