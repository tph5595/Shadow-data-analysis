576193,"Just started BotW (my 2nd Zelda game; I completed Phantom Hourglass a long time ago) and I'm not having too much fun at all.  I have 8 shrines completed, and was currently making my way towards the Zora village before turning it off.

I'm the type of player who likes to make a beeline and focus on main quests.  If I see something on the side that's along the way and simple to do, I'll do it, but generally I stick on the main path.

Having two ""issues"" with the game right now.

1.  One is I feel that there is just so much running around.  I unlock fast travel towers/shrines whenever I can but I still feel like 75% of the game is running, and watching my stamina meter.  

2. This game is kicking my ass too.  Only got halfway to the Zora village and I'm burning a lot of my ""material"" (because I haven't come across a pot to turn it into food since the start of the game).  I'm still running around with 0 rupees because I'm not sure how to get them, and still wearing the starting armor (well I got the cold resistant one from the old man on top of the mountain at the beginning).  Pretty much every time I get hit from a lightning arrow, I lose 3+ hearts and I end up eating like 6+ apples to bring it back up.  Is crafting gonna be a huge thing in this game (potions, foods, arrows)  I hate taking time out to craft/navigate menus in my games, and it feels like a lot of busywork to me.  I just wish I can pick up upgrades by completing main story, or doing quests.
