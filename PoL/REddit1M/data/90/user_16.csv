47136,"Look, IMO master mode is kinda more tedious than challenging. There’s some extra stuff like Golden enemies and such, but I’d say it isn’t really fun if you’re not one of those 100% completionists. A good example are the Bokoblins on the Grand Plateau on Master Mode. They’re all Blue and Black. For reference, the Blues have 72 HP. Now think you’ll be killing those with 3 hearts and Traveler’s Swords at best. Everything one shots you, and takes like 20 hits to kill. If you’re REALLY into the game and REALLY confident you’re decent at it, go for it. If you’re a completionist, either be up for some more 120 hours or don’t start it at all."
47207,There’re 120 total. 
48055,"Holy crap dude, 4 hearts and no stamina!? First of all do some exploring. I’m not saying you should do what I did, but at least get some more shrines. With this HP you’ll get hit-killed by anything that’s not a Red Bokoblin. I completed the map and got 5 hearts and a second stamina wheel before doing the first Beast, for instance. Besides the shrines, get some new gear by exploring or buying stuff. Decent weapons can be found pretty much anywhere that’s far from the Great Plateau.  Also learn how the cooking system works. Elixirs and Food are really important early on because they give you resistance to various things until you’re able to get specialized gear. Some good tips are:
 
- You can’t have more than one effect on a dish/elixir

- Parts from stronger monsters create stronger elixirs

- You can’t use any monster part to make any elixir. For example, using Bokoblin Fangs to make Sneaky Elixirs won’t work. You’ll have to experiment a bit, the system is really well made so you won’t easily find a list of what goes with what online.

- A lot of NPCs on villages can hint about specific dishes for specific situations, probably related to the location of the village. An NPC in a really hot place could hint at an ingredient/recipe to alleviate the heat and so on.

Also, about the YouTube channels, just looking up stuff like “BotW beginner tips” should work. I wouldn’t recommend a specific channel because they’d normally involve content from various sections of the game, which could spoil stuff for you.

Good luck and enjoy the game!"
84896,"Ohhhh, yesterday was your first day, that explains it! Then your progress is pretty good actually. "
117523,"&gt; t's actually about which part it is (yeah it's counter-intuitive): a Bokoblin horn adds the exact same duration of a Lynel horn for example. Only thing that changes is the selling value.

This, I had no Idea. What about Parts unique to certain monsters, like Hooves or Talons? 

&gt; Uh? Of course it works. You have to use at least a Sunset Firefly in the recipe, but monster parts are completely interchangeable.

Are you suuure about this? I’m completely sure you can’t use Bokoblin/Moblin Fangs for Hasty Elixirs, for example, while I’m pretty sure I remember Lizalfos Talon making a better Hasty Elixir than Boko Horns. The Example I used with Boko Fangs was just a random example, I should’ve actually tested it rather than pulling it out of my ass."
124108,"&gt; There are three tiers of monster parts in total, again some are very counter-intuitive: Hooves and Talons for example are tier 2, same as Boko and Moblin Fangs (they all add 1:50 to the duration), while Keese Eyeballs are tier 3 (add 3:10) like Guts and Tails.

Huh. So 2 A tier effect items plus 3 Keese Eyeballs would make the most long lasting possible elixir of any kind? Or is there anything that goes beyond 3:10?

&gt; There's actually a lot of very detailed info available on the internet on this subject. I can give you some links if you want, unless you prefer experimenting for yourself.

I’d actually love it. I’ve looked it up for some time and only found those shitty “CLICK HERE FOR THE BEST BOTW RECIPEAS!!1!” vídeos or sites. I’ve also done a lot of experimenting and the best I could come up with were like a 10 minutes Haste and an 8 minutes Mighty. I would persist with the experimenting but I’m currently grinding for armor upgrades, so the best time to have the good boosts would be now. "
