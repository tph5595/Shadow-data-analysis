95407,Is there a limit on how many times I can add an inventory slot with Hestu? Is there a max for each option?
95620,"I went to 15 hearts before I did any extra stamina. For the most part I was completely fine stamina wise in any situation. I now have two wheels and 16 hearts. I haven’t found any situation yet where I needed more than two wheels of stamina. Without spoiling it for you, there’s something that will help save stamina that you’ll have later. But if you’re going for every shrine I think you can get to three wheels and like 27 hearts or something like that. "
95846,I did my first one with 5 hearts. You’re ready and they’re really awesome. I was planning on doing them slowly but after I did my first one I made a beeline for the other three. 
98727,No problem. I just started playing after Christmas so I’m discovering things as well. There are so many different ways to do things and it only increases as you keep playing. I played for three hours last night and all I “accomplished” was four shrines and lots of exploring. Had a blast. 
99922,I still haven’t caught a wild horse. I just steal them from enemies. 
102693,55 slots? So I could have 55 weapon slots or does each slot eventually cap off?
104607,Thanks. That’s what I wanted to know. So you get one page for each. 
119216,Awesome. Thanks. 
184729,Is it true I can explore Hyrule Castle without triggering the Ganon fight? I’m saving that fight for later while I explore the map and complete shrines so I don’t want to accidentally start the fight.
