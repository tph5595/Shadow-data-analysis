44459,"I would like some advice since this is my first Zelda game and I have no clue how I should be playing this game lol.

First of all right now I cleared 7 shrines and I got the mission where I [SPOILERS] [SPOILERS] *need to take it up against the four monsters (forgot the name) and I randomly found the Zora guy (believe his name is Sidion or something like that, don't have my Switch on me now)* but I kindda want to wait before I dive in to the main quest since I haven't upgraded my Stamina yet and I want to get a bit more hearts if I can (I have 4 at this moment) 

What I would like to have are some tips on how I should develop/play the game, at least in the current state that I'm in. I'm absolutely in love with the world but the game let's you go your own way a lot and that's not something I'm used to in videogames. 

Also I would like to know some good YouTube videos/channels for helping me out along the way or for some good tips and tricks because I wasn't really able to find any myself. 

If someone is able to help me that would be amazing! Thanks in advance!"
70633,Thank you very much for replying! I guess you're right but I was just 'afraid' to miss out on certain gameplay aspects that would really take away a part of the experience. I'll try to avoid YouTube and Reddit for as long as I can and I'll try to do as much shrines early on as I can. Thanks for the advice! 
70825,"Thanks buddy! Like I said to someone making a similar statement I'll try to avoid Reddit and YouTube for as long as I can to enhance the experience for myself, I was just checking to see if I would miss out on any gameplay mechanics or something like that because I want to embrace this games' full potential"
70925,"Haha thanks for the help, I'm trying to find some more shrines right now but yesterday was my first day of playing so I didn't expect to get that far early on, I play games very slowly (AC O took me 200 hours to get platinum trophy (all achievements))

Thanks for the tips! Glad to use them ^^"
252255,"How do I trigger the By Firefly's Light side quest? I did everything I need to do (got the camera, did the 2 side quests before that) but the quest still doesn't activate when I visit Lasli at night. Also tried to release the fireflies but they just vanished in to the thin air"
360472,"Is it possible to miss out on the best weapons/gear in the game? For example I heard the Zora King speak of a {SPOILER!!!!!!} Master Sword but I would like to know if this sword (and other items) are misable in this game. I try to avoid guides / gameplay videos as much as I can because I don't want (visual) spoilers. Only if I really can't wrap my head around somthing like a puzzle I look for that particular thing in a video.

363506,"Yes, I think the sword and shield are 2 items i really would like to have as soon as possible so could you maybe show me some links without spoiling too much about other aspects of the game? "
375255,"Oh there's no need of that good friend, I'll go and look for it myself tomorrow. Zelda Dungeon is just a website? I sometimes use I believe Polygon/IGN (don't know if I'm right) "
426882,I did a bit of reading to find out more about the shield and it turns out the shield is actually breakable but I also heard that it is possible to regain the shield once it's broken. Can you confirm that that's true? And also what are the costs to get the shield again? I hope you can help me out! Right now I need three more hearts for me to be able to get the Master Sword
