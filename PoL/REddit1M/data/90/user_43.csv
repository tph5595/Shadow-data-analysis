But when you get toward the middle of the game, freed a few divine beasts you might have a set of armor that you don't have all the pieces to (I didn't find the final piece of the climbing gear armor until after I beat the game, and I had to use the IGN wiki...), don't be afraid to look up a guide on something you know you really want! If you keep waiting to come across something naturally, it very possibly might not happen just because the game is so big."
