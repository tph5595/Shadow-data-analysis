I keep hearing complains about the weapon break system. Now I will be buying the game and I never checked anything about it in order to go into it blindly but the only complain that I keep hearing is how the weapons break.

Now as far as I know when a weapon break this makes you afraid of using your favorite weapon, yet it can also help you by learning about all the other weapons out there so you won't stick with one weapon.

So what are your thought guys?"
