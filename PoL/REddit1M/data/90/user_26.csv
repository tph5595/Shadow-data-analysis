118115,"Breath of the Wild and Twilight Princess are different in the way they handle puzzles. In Breath of the Wild, the puzzles are sort of split into mini-challenges, or shrines. These are nowhere near the scale of Twilight Princess's dungeons in size or complexity.

There aren't any environmental puzzles that completely halt the game like the video you linked, either.

In general, if you have a hard time with puzzles you might be stumped on a few shrines. But a few out of the many, many shrines that are in the game is no big deal.

There are bigger, more traditional dungeons that have larger scale puzzles, but they are meant to take more time than shrines.

If you ever get stuck, just look it up. There's no shame in that.

Good luck!"

On the other hand, the Champions Ballad is a sort of continuation of the main story. If you want to buy the DLC before you finish the game, I would recommend beating all of the divine beasts BEFORE playing the Champions Ballad.

I beat the game before any of the DLC packs were released so I can't give you an answer from personal experience, but if you're going to buy the DLC anyway, I would recommend doing this:

1. Beat all the divine beasts
2. Champions Ballad
3. Beat the game
4. Master Trials

(You can interchange 3 and 4, as you do not NEED to beat the game before the Master Trials, but you'll likely be more experienced by then)"

For shields, the number is weird and means a few different things, look here for more info: https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/5z8z7b/botw_what_the_shield_ratings_actually_mean/

For armor, the higher the number, the less damage you will take from attacks.

Durability is not displayed unless it is ""badly damaged"" and at that point it will blink red in your inventory and the game will tell you every time you take out that shield or weapon. Armor does not have durability and it will never break."
541749,"Try and find where the patrolling guards are. Once you find them, try to identify their path, or at least a portion of their path. Drop a banana in their range of vision. Wait as the guard runs like a little girl over to your banana, completely enthralled. Sneak up behind him and do a stealthstrike, using a strong enough weapon that it will kill in one hit. Rinse and repeat for each guard.

Now that all the guards are dead, you can explore at will.

If you really get stuck, just look up a guide."
