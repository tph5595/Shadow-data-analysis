If you play Master Mode after completing a normal playthrough, your knowledge will outweigh the added difficulty by a huge margin.

If you want to stay in Normal, I suggest at least not abusing defense (and Hearty) food as you seem to be doing, if you want it to be challenging."

112821,"&gt;You can’t use any monster part to make any elixir. For example, using Bokoblin Fangs to make Sneaky Elixirs won’t work.

Uh? Of course it works. You have to use at least a Sunset Firefly in the recipe, but monster parts are completely interchangeable.

The statement about parts from stronger monsters creating stronger elixirs is also wrong. Monster parts don't add ""strength"" to an elixir, but just duration; also, it's not about stronger monster, it's actually about which part it is (yeah it's counter-intuitive): a Bokoblin horn adds the exact same duration of a Lynel horn for example. Only thing that changes is the selling value."
121034,"&gt;This, I had no Idea. What about Parts unique to certain monsters, like Hooves or Talons?

There are three tiers of monster parts in total, again some are very counter-intuitive: Hooves and Talons for example are tier 2, same as Boko and Moblin Fangs (they all add 1:50 to the duration), while Keese Eyeballs are tier 3 (add 3:10) like Guts and Tails.

Again, the only difference is selling value.

&gt;Are you suuure about this?

Yeah, I'm absolutely sure. And you *can* use those fangs for Hasty elixirs of course, you must have mixed something wrong. The rules are simple:

- you need to put at least 1 insect and 1 monster part
- the remaining ingredients must either be of the same type of the insect or ""neutral"" (apples, acorn, even meat etc., of course these only provide duration, not ""strength"" of the effect)

ie. 1x Hot-Footed Frog + 1x Bokoblin Fang + 2x Fleet-Lotus Seeds + 1x Swift Carrot is a perfectly valid Lv3 Hasty elixir.

There's actually a lot of very detailed info available on the internet on this subject. I can give you some links if you want, unless you prefer experimenting for yourself."
126612,"&gt;Huh. So 2 A tier effect items plus 3 Keese Eyeballs would make the most long lasting possible elixir of any kind? Or is there anything that goes beyond 3:10?

You could do 1x insect/frog/lizard + 4x Keese Eyeballs to maximize the duration if you wanted, but of course with just that single insect the strength of the effect will be Lv1. However yes, there are ingredients that go beyond that limit: Dragon parts. Horns in particular guarantee 30:00 no matter what. **They're not considered monster parts though**, they're ""neutral"" ingredients, and best cooked in meals, not elixirs.

As for the links, I've been using [this chart](https://i.imgur.com/FrNjewV.png), that was originally posted in [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/62xurt/full_effects_of_all_cooking_ingredients/).

To put it simple, each effect-granting ingredient has a point value (ie for Hasty, Rushrooms are worth 1 point, Fleet-Lotus Seeds are worth 2 etc.) and you have to reach a certain number of points to get the maximum effect. The author didn't put the point requirements for each effect in the chart, but he wrote them in the thread somewhere. They're:

- 7 points for Lv3 Attack, Defense, Speed up and Lv2 Fireproof (Lv2 is max for the latter)
- 6 points for Lv3 Shock resistance
- 6 points for Lv2 Heat and Cold resistance (Lv2 is max for these two)
- 9 points for Lv3 Stealth

So for example, one of the best Hasty combinations would be 3x Fleet Lotus (3x2=6 points) + 1x Rushroom (1 point) to reach the 7 points threshold for max speed, then add a Dragon Horn for 30:00 duration. Of course you can use Swift Violets in place of (or along with) the Fleet Lotuses, and a Swift Carrots in place of the Rushroom. Once you know the values and the threshold it's easy to come up with your own BEST BOTW RECIPEAS!!1!

I'd save the one south-west for last for the opposite reasons."
