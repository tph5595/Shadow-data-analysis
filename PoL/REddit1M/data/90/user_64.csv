554981,"I recently bought the switch with BOTW, haven't played since Ocarina of Time. I'm 3 Divine breasts in, gotten every shrine except those in the Southwest region. I've heard about the DLC pack a little. Should I buy it now? Not sure everything extra it has, and not very familiar with DLC in general. I don't know if I would have the patience to play the entire game again, or at least not for a while. Should I get the DLC pack now or in 6 months to a year when I'm willing to restart the game?"
