37719,"More than anything else in the game, I enjoy exploring. I've found at least half of the shrines simply by exploring and completing quests. I don't even complete the shrines, usually - I run up and activate the pad for fast travel, and then I head off to find the next one.

At this point I want to know how many shrines are left for me to find.

Since I've unlocked all of the towers and I obsessively use stamps, my map is a complete mess. Attempts to count by hand have been pointless because I always lose my place. Bearing in mind that I usually don't even go inside, much less complete the shrine, is there an easy way to see the number of shrines that I've found?"
58612,"We're talking 40-50 shrines just to get an accurate count. It adds up pretty fast. I like the shrines, I've already completed 15 or so, but I just really prefer exploring.

I thought maybe there was a hidden part of the UI that might tell me."
