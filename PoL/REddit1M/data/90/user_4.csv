15469,"Depends. Do you find yourself wanting to sprint longer or do you find yourself needing health?

I just beat the game and I went full 30 hearts with nothing in stamina. And i think theres maybe one or two places i havent been able to climb with one circle and even those could probably be done if I spent more time on a route.

So yeah...you dont really need more stamina to get anywhere. For me the best use would be more stamina for charged hits but thats up to the user.
