33714,"Hey guys, I have 8 hearts and an extra half stamina wheel, is it time for me to tackle one of the divine beasts? (If so what one?) I am debating doing this or going around getting all the shrines and doing the divine beasts after.   I know it’s entirely up to the player but a bit of advice would be appreciated"
