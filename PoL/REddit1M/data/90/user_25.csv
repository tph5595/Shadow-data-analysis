116142,"hello friends, considering buying this game for my shiny new switch, as ive been told by basically every game reviewer it's one of the greatest (if not THE greatest) games of the year. however, i have my reservations. my only prior zelda experience is with twilight princess on the wii. while that game was fun for a while, the absurd specificity required by some of the puzzle solutions really irritated me. i felt that without the aid of an IGN or gamespot guide, some of the later puzzles would have been very difficult and time consuming to find solutions for. i know that's part of the appeal for proper zelda fans, but that's not me. 

this one puzzle in TP in particular annoyed me so much, i went and sold the game to gamestop without properly finishing the game:

so here's my question: how does the difficulty of the puzzles compare between the two games? is it possible to beat breath of the wild without consistently being stumped by puzzles for more than 20 minutes?
