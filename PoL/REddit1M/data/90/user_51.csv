363257,It is very possible to miss out on the best weapons. For example the master sword and the hylian shield are not required to beat the game. Do you want to know how to find these items? A lot of the top notch items can also be found in a specific place if you want to know that as well.

373819,I'm at work right now if you want to wait a few hours i could give the site a quick look through and be a little more helpful

456788,Yes the shield is breakable but if you break it you can buy it again from a guy in Terry Town. Theres a couple of side quests you have to do to build terry town. If you want i can tell you how to gwt that started or you can consult thw guide
