165384,Are there any places to take a picture of an ancient arrow? I want to take all compendium pictures myself if possible but it seems I can only find them in chests or buying them from the lab.
165960,"What you need to learn first is not to grow too attached to weapons. Second, you don’t need to worry about running out of weapons. That’ll pretty much never happen unless you attempt to defeat a particularly strong enemy early. But you probably won’t do that if said enemy can kill you in one hit.

And as you said, trying out different kinds of weapons is always great. Sure, you can only stick to one handed swords, but you could also try a two handed weapon. It is slower but usually stronger as well. This keeps variety in the game even after like 100 hours.

At the end, it just comes down to how much you like inventory management. I enjoy it but I can see how it’s not everyone’s cup of tea."
