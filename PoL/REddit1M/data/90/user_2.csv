11614,"Hey guys. Just finished my first divine beast (elephant). Anyways, I have 6 hearts and 2 stamina wheels. Should I keep investing in stamina until I get three wheels or should I now start farming Heart containers? On a separate question, How much stamina can one have without using any food/elixir enhancements?"

22293,Thanks.
98309,Thanks. That’s really helpful and still sensitive about spoiling. :)
99270,Lol. I started playing during New Years. And it took me like 3 hours to do the Spring of Courage and finding/catching a giant horse. This game is awesome!
