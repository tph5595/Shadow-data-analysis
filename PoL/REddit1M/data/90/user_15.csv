Progress on the main story doesn't change the game or dynamics except [certain monsters upgrade in difficulty after completing a divine beast and certain quests are unavailable under after a divine beast](/spoiler). Where you are on the main quest isn't near to triggering any change, so you can follow it if you'd like.

To get stronger, you can look around for items, visit towns, and find shrines. In this process, you can find other things that will help you get stronger. 

Honestly, if you find yourself somewhere where you die a lot, go somewhere else. If you find yourself overpowered by enemies or environmental conditions, find another area to explore.

Go up high and look for shrines. Gliding down to a shrine is a fast way to get somewhere. Unlock towers. They give you a good vantage point and glide off point, as well as opening up your map.

I'd stay away from Youtube channels if you don't want to ruin the game for yourself. The exploration of the unknown is the strongest part of the game."
46658,"Once you do Ganon, you're likely to feel like not finishing the game. You can (and should) explore Hyrule Castle before beating Ganon. It's very well done. 

I did the shrines, found something like 500 korok seeds, and upgraded nearly all the armor. I also completed all the main quests. This was very satisfying, honestly. I've restarted with Master Mode, because it's just not very fun beating Ganon and continuing with very small, minor completionist tasks."
46851,"I waited until I completed a playthrough without the DLC to buy the DLC. I enjoyed the exploration part of it and spent a lot of time on the playthrough. 

Master Mode is good fun though. It's not very different when fighting one enemy, but it's pretty brutal when facing a group. I don't think anything is going to make you want to farm ingredients (I prefer hoarding and exploring and only farm when absolutely necessary), since that's just tedious. "

67431,"You can parry with a pot lid, so just visit a few towns. Any shield will do. I typically use my worst shields for Guardian parrying."
133459,"Very few puzzles in BOTW are truly difficult. What is different about BOTW is that you have everything you need to solve any puzzle when you finish the tutorial, so you don't have to beat your head against a puzzle because you haven't got the special tool required. 

Also, you can walk away from any puzzle. Frustrated with a Divine Beast? Warp out and come back later. You can progress the story in another way. Can't get into a door? Mark it on your map and come back later. The advantage is that sometimes a solution to one problem doesn't occur to you, but when you come back later after taking on other puzzles, you see how you can approach it differently.

There were very, very few things that I had to look up to figure out. One was a very specific tip to get a chest, not at all a major part of the story."
152405,"The weapon breakage is initially disconcerting. You do hoard good weapons out of fear that they will break.

However, the game couldn't offer nearly the same variety of weapons without this system, and if you happen upon a very strong weapon early on, it would make you too overpowered if you could just use that weapon the entire game.

You get smarter with weapons as you go on, and the durability of weapons improves throughout the game. I do have a few favorites at the end of the game, and those last without a problem."
475617,"I skipped exploration on the plateau for my Master Mode run in favor of heading out as fast as possible to get more shrines and hearts. I got the Stealth Set as soon as humanly possible. Grab Korok seeds to get more weapon slots.

Basically, only now at 10 hearts I've stopped totally avoiding conflict. "
475729,"Go in the backdoor to Hyrule Castle. Much easier.

You can parry guardians with Pot Lids. You can pick some up in most villages and stables."
475977,"Most shrine quests that you don't actually need to find the shrine start with a conversation at a town or stable. People with a red speech bubble have a quest to offer.

Other than that, Kass has quests all over the board. Have you found the book about his travels? Near another Shrine Quest started by him?

As far as I know, the other people you need to talk to start a Shrine Quest outside of stables and towns all start quests that reveal the shrine, rather than just hint to its location. "

558003,"I contemplated this around the same point. I'm glad I resisted buying the DLC until I finished my first playthrough. Once I had all the shrines, all the main objectives complete, and beat Ganon, I didn't really feel like grinding out anything else, not even some of the limited post-game stuff. I enjoyed it up to that point, but it didn't feel necessary to complete or that it would be that fun to complete.

So instead, I restated with the DLC in Master Mode. It's really good fun. I didn't wait. Just got the DLC and am doing a Master Mode run. The enemies are brutal, so it's more challenging and the extra DLC stuff is helping temper the challenge.

As it stands, you are probably quite overpowered already, so the DLC will only be extra power when you don't need it. On the other hand, the extra chests mean a lot now in Master Mode while I'm still pretty weak since I go through weapons like crazy."
562644,"The orbs will respawn if you move far enough way. If you knock the orb too far, run to the other side of the island, and the orb will respawn where you got it from originally.

FWIW, Stasis isn't the easiest rune to use to accomplish your goal. There may be another way ... "
579543,"BOTW is a game that rewards exploration. You find stuff that makes you gradually stronger. Blowing through the main quest is possible because the game doesn't place any restrictions you, but it's also not a game that walks you through everything. 

You may be used to games where the main quest is 75% or more of the game. I'd say more than half of BOTW is outside the main quest of divine beasts and Ganon. Take a hint that some of the main quest involves exploring new areas to find memories.

You can absolutely pick up everything you need doing quests, but that includes side quests and general exploration. Focusing on the main quest will leave you pretty weak and finishing the game quickly. 

My suggestions are to do some side quests in the towns you've already visited to get a feel for that play. Also, on the road to Zora, don't walk on the road. You can climb just above or beside and avoid most of the enemies, honestly.

The Zora village is a very well-done portion of the game and after that, you may get a better feel for the exploration part, rather than just blowing through as fast as possible."
