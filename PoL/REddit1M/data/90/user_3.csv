Personally I did 2 hearts : 1 stamina. At the end of 124 shrines, I had 27 hearts and 3-1/5 stamina. I deviated from my rule once or twice. You need 13 hearts for one part of the game."

I don't have a source for this but apparently the Producer (Aonuma?) has said he regrets making an official timeline for the LoZ series, as it stifles creativity for future titles. They don't want to feel locked into putting certain things into the game because they have to be there for consistency sake, but would rather have recurring elements and use them as they want.

All that said, I think this game is on the Twilight Princess timeline because of something Zelda says during the game. I've heard a creative claim the the Akkala and Death Mountain regions are basically the same map as the original Legend of Zelda. With map overlays to back it up.

I try not to get bogged down in the meta, as intriguing as it is. I enjoy BotW for what it is, especially if it stands by itself. "
