34783,tackle one right now hahaha you’re beyond ready I think I did my first one with 6 hearts. Start with the zora’s domain one since it is the closest. I just finished all 4 with only 14 hearts and like 2 and a quarter of stamina wheels. The abilities you get from defeating them help when exploring for shrines. 
34956,ok so i just finished the divine beasts and im happy about that and all but like ive only done like around half of the shrines and only have like 50 something korok seeds. Should I do all the shrines and max out korok seeds (not 900 but enough to max out slots) before doing ganon??? 
49980,thanks for the advice!! Im currently exploring and doing shrines/shrine quests/looking for koroks :)
