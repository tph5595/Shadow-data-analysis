22353,"The expansion has Daruk's journal which mentions Link doing it in the past, but the player is meant to figure it out on their own (or not at all). After you learn to parry you could try it on everything and realize almost anything can be parried"
112030,You can only buy it after beating Ganon.
153093,"Ask NPCs at a nearby stable, or try entering it from another direction."
154509,"&gt; Meaning unless you go straight there after the great plateau, you'll never learn if it's your first time

Most people went there first. When you get the paraglider the king gives you two quests, both with markers. One is *Seek Out Impa* (complete with directions for which roads to take), the other is *Destroy Ganon.* Yeah."

302903,"Not sure what the difference you're talking about is (""completing"" vs ""solving?"") but you have to get the Spirit Orb from all of them"

459282,"There's no ""near the end of the game"" because you can do *Destroy Ganon* any time you want. You don't need to do any main quests past *The Isolated Plateau* to get to the credits"
487060,"It's not possible to play in post-Ganon Hyrule, like previous Zelda games"
487201,"&gt; That spark only appears during actual thunderstorms and is on the item itself.

It's also on the icon in the inventory"
538925,Oh gotcha üëç
549005,"When cooked, one of any ""Hearty"" food makes a dish that fully recovers your hearts. There's a convenient spot for a bunch of Hearty Durians just north of Faron Tower"
549899,"&gt; Sneak up behind him and do a stealthstrike, using a strong enough weapon that it will kill in one hit.

The blademasters in the stealth section are scripted to die in one hit from any sneakstrike."
582654,"&gt; Do I really have to keep restarting eventide island?

Only if you make mistakes that bad repeatedly. Use Cryonis instead of launching the ball, by the way"
