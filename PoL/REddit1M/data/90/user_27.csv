119205,"Hi. I got BotW a little while ago and I just completed the Goron area. As such, I then proceeded to head on my merry little way to the next Divine Beast. So, I'm paragliding over this forest thing and all of a sudden trees are here, there's fog, the screen turns white, and I hear a strange voice. All of a sudden, I'm back to where I started from. I tried investigating a couple more times and got the same result. So, my question to you all is this: What. The. Hell. Just. Happened?"
