The trick is to press A when the beep sounds. Too early and you get burned by the laser, too late and you can break your shield, it is difficult to master. There are a lot of mechanics that the game doesn't explain very well."

Get arrows and good bows. You don't need the matter sword or the Julian shield, there are plenty of good shields inside wasteland and Gerudo. Take a moment to hunt canines and cook the gourmet meat with salt for easy healing food."

239725,You should try entering through the main road and make your way inside the forest. Just keep an eye with the ashes ;)
