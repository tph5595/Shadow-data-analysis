All you need to do is get a bottle on your B button, and suddenly, that line turns into more of a helix shape. Or perhaps you could play an ocarina that doesn't exist while inside a boss room, now you've got a parabolically shaped quest. Don't like the last two temples? No problem! Just pick up a deku nut while underwater and you can get those last two pesky medallions for free! And if all that weren't enough, you could spend your time going for the fabled ""ass chest"" Easter egg!"

49789,This is done by using a trick called [bottle duplication]( http://www.zeldaspeedruns.com/oot/tech/bottle-duplication) through which you can replace almost any item on the inventory screen with a bottle!
87981,"many, many ways to fudge the line! the game has so many intricate and unique tricks and glitches, that it has near infinite replay value. unfortunately a lot of people have some weird pre-existing bias against glitches like these, so they tend to make false claims about the game without knowing any of the amazing things possible within it.

And no, it's not like saying it's not worth it to play since you can skip 90% of the game. There are tons and tons of different ways to play the game because of these tricks and glitches, much more than just the any% speedrun route where you skip from ghoma to Ganon that everyone has seen.

These tricks and glitches allow for bingo, puzzles, tons of different speedrun routes, and challenges and cool things to try.

Whether or not these glitches were intended is irrelevant. They exist within the game. Holding a game at face value and only assessing it only based on how it may or may not have been ""intended"" to play is just plain stupid, and it's a damn shame that people miss out on the beautiful accidents within OoT, because they write it all off instantly for being a glitch.

This is like writing off the entire Skyrim modding community because they aren't playing the game the way the developers intended them to. You can't tell some one how to play a game, and it's almost bigoted to dismiss the legitimacy of mechanics that exist inside the game because they don't coalign with your beliefs about how the game should be played."
