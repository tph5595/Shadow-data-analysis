If they reappeared redone in the BotW style they still would terrify me a decade later.  
  
In Batman terms BotW makes the enemies Bane/Killer Croc imposing enemies where as Redead were Scarecrow/Joker mentally terrifying"

But yeah killing them now is just satisfying because the amount of dread I used to have encountering them. Any run of OoT I do now I kill them when I go through the town square with just the sword."
