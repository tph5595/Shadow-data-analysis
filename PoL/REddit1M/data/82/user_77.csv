OoT is a WAY better game than BOTW.  There's just.....nothing to do in BOTW.  Find shrines...raid a couple of repetitive camps.  Scavenge new weapons that will break in 20 minutes anyway.

The initial ""wow, this place is HUGE!"" got old really quickly.  There's only so many times I could explore over a mountain and find....nothing there.  No caves to explore, no ruins to loot.  Just more....territory.

The game is kinda empty.  And it's left me disappointed.  "

BOTW is big, but empty.  It's not worth exploring."

The Divine Beasts are pathetic excuses for dungeons, and I don't think they're a positive at all."
62262,"Compared to a game like Skyrim and Witcher 3, not really.  Each of those games had dungeons, ruins, and caves to explore.  Each with unique enemies that required strategy to defeat, and actual loot at the end that was worth going for."
62306,Glad I'm not alone.  I was a little underwhelmed.  The polish of the initial world reveal faded pretty quickly when I realized it was just moving from one room dungeon to one room dungeon that all look the same.
68407,Don't get me wrong.  I'm enjoying the game.  Just not at the same level I've enjoyed other Zelda games.
68446,I can get behind this.
