64340,I think he is assuming you stopped playing fairly early in the game because the durability and strength of weapons increases dramatically once you stop using traveler's weapons and sticks. Also once you get the Master Sword you have a weapon that never breaks and also you have endless bombs and magnetic powers and the ability to stop time to help you fight. So there are more ways to use weapons/fight/etc in BOTW than you may have given credit for.
