67632,"I just finally got to play BotW, and I have to say that *some* things do feel like I have to leave and come back for lack of equipment/items (I still have yet to manage to beat a Major Test of Strength, for example), although I guess puzzles are a different matter entirely."
67819,"The first time I played it, it was on a friend's TV with surround sound at like, midnight. We were both too spooked to sleep."
68349,"While I'm loving the game so far, I do have to admit the Divine Beasts were a letdown. I got really excited for a proper dungeon when I got to my first one, only to find that it was a glorified trial in the end. I miss the massive dungeons in WW."
68421,"Don't forget the apparatus ones, where you argue with motion controls and good luck completing them comfortably if you're using your switch as a handheld."
68520,"I don't mind the durability, but I would have liked some way to track it besides ""your weapon is badly damaged!"""
68688,"Honestly, I was a little confused when BotW was being heralded as being the first open world Zelda game *right after* ALBW came out (and Nintendo said they were going back to their roots and trying to make a game similar to the original NES game). I just don't think people associate top-down style games with open world for some reason. "
69157,"I thought they were clever, but it always seemed when I did them, it was either too sensitive or not sensitive enough, so I'd either end up trying to align something and overshooting a hundred times or it just wouldn't do. And then I had issues with the axes of the platforms shifting away from the axes of the controller and it just became a pain to maneuver.

I think motion controls are a great idea, but they certainly haven't been perfected yet."
69664,"Ah, I'm the opposite. When it's used well, I find that it's a great way to engage with the game. When the apparatus puzzles work well, I actually enjoy them and feel more involved, and I really enjoy using motion controls to help with aiming bows/runes."
72487,"I'm pretty far in with 3 Divine Beasts, the master sword, and probably close to 40-ish hours clocked. I have no problem staying out of the way and staying alive, using flurry strikes, floating + shock arrows when I need to, I just usually end up with a bunch of broken gear and fighting it off with bombs by the time it's about half health."
