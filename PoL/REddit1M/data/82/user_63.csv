52108,every time they show up i play the sun song. in MM i wear any mask that makes them dance. in WW i run away
52519,i got her too and i regret it. i completely negated the finding a good horse part of the game (i did find a giant horse tho and tamed it that was really cool)
52588,how is it better than breath of the wild’s hyrule tho? it’s a close second for me personally
52648,"that’s a shame, it’s one of many features that kept me interested and engaged! hope you go back to it some day"
52844,the original LoZ was the first open world LoZ. AttP and ALBW were also fairly open world (especially ALBW)
52955,"i respect your opinion. i disagree with it, but i give you only upvotes today. thanks for contributing to the discussion :)"
59748,"did we explore different hyrules in BOTW? i loved every second of exploration in that game, there was so much to see and do!"
61989,i felt differently about all that ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ sorry it wasn’t for you!
70881,"major tests of strength become doable when you fully grasp the combat of the game, which takes a while. then, they’re a breeze"
70962,i think the whole deal with BOTW is that it’s the first 3D zelda with an open world
81216,usually i don’t even break a weapon fighting a major test of strength... i can make it through most of the fight just using the master sword and when that needs to recharge it’s almost dead
