Most of the shines are just gimmicky, and the whole memory things on top of that is just there to make you think there's more than there really is. It's a beautiful game, but for an open world game that seems to want you to explore, it mostly results in lots of running from one empty space to another dodging groups of enemies you've killed 5 times already. "
62530,I think it was a great first effort at moving towards a real open world set up for the franchise. Next time I really hope they build upon what they have and fill it in more. 
62777,"And all of those shrines are all the same thing. You either solve a simple puzzle with one or two runes, or a slightly more complicated one with most or all of the runes. Or you fight some guardian. Or fetch an item and offer it up and just get into the shrine. Kind of gets old after about 10, becomes tedious at 20, and is just a slog by the time you get to 100. It's the cheap and easy way to trick people into thinking the world is more full than it is. "
62832,"The game play, and size of the game space itself is must better and larger, but I feel the story and feel just isn't there when compared to OoT. "
68660,"OH yeah. Those are totes the greatest thing ever.... It's been nearly 10 years and people still don't care about motion controls or even like them, I don't know why Nintendo keeps trying to force that shit. "
69443,I think its a ridiculous gimmick. I don't want to flail my controller around. I just want to sit there with minimal movement. 
135541,"I think they're trying to find a middle ground. Get rid of all the dumb weapons, cut it back to a few, no weapon durability. Bring back the cool strength gauntlets, and heavy boots, and simple tunics of the past. Keep the huge world, but fill it with lots of actually clever things to do and find. Bring back the awesome themed temples of the past. I think that would really make for a new best LoZ game. "
165115,"I don't know that I think it's the worst, but the whole single theme dungeon set up is really disappointing. I feel like I'm constantly being slapped in the face with how awesome shit was in the past..."
165765,"I'm mostly enjoying the game, but I kind of wonder at the replay value it has. "
