124930,"OOT: Bosses actually do damage to you

BOTW: I did bad and lost 2 hearts total

You were also invincible in BotW after a certain point so even the minor guys dont cause trouble. I died early but didnt die for the last 3/4 of my play time."
125114,"What did you do? Fight the same enemies in different places? Find your 2000th korok seed? Find a bundle of arrows?

BotW had a lot of cool looking places. Nothing else was worth exploring for and I stopped after a certain point. I just went to named places or things that looked weird to see what they were.

OOT or any other Zelda has tons of exploration value as anything you find could be a new heart or actually useful rupees."
125210,They heard every criticism for SS and completely overreacted. Combine the two and you'd have a perfect game maybe. As it stands you have one Zelda game and one Skyrim called Zelda.
164831,That is what I thought I was getting with BotW. I assumed any Zelda game ever made would have dungeons with themes and bosses to fit the theme. I had gone in expecting the best Zelda ever until I hit that first dungeons and realized the game was going to be the worst one ever in my sad opinion :/
164910,Eh none of them caused me trouble. Lynels the only trouble was not using too many healing or items on killing them. Sure they could hit me a fair bit with their unfair speed and such but I was never really in danger with Miphas grace etc
165568,Yah I didnt have much hope after the first dungeon but the moment I saw the second one was identical I cried a bit. The only fun part about the dungeons in the entire game was actually in my first one with the entrance fight to get into the Elephant. That was actually entertaining.
165889,I passed it and havent really thought about touching it in the last month or two. Recently going back to play some other old games of mine... although I might be getting Stardew Valley and will be getting Odyssey so who knows if I'll keep going with the old ones :P
