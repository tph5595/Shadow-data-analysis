36599,"I think it's a combination.  So there are definitely areas you can go that always have the higher powered enemies, as a way of discouraging going there early in the game.  But I think this mechanic works mainly to level up the lowest common denominator of that enemy type.  It's actually quite genius.  I didn't know this mechanic existed until now, but I can confirm that last night I was starting to see a lot more of the blue bokoblins than the red.  I thought it was just because I'm in a new area.  I wonder if this is the ""special trick"" Aonuma was talking about implementing in this game. "
