0,"I love that the devs left out any exp/level gain (like in other Zelda games) but this game has such good rpg elements. Your strength is equal to the exploration, weapon and item gathering and challenge (shrines) you came past. It is sooo rewarding that the adventure itself makes you stronger instead of quest and monster grinding! Good job on that one that is so refreshing in a time where mmos and other rpgs all feel the same"
