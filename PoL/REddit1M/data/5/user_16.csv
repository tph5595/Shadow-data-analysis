22863,"Last night was the first bit of gameplay for me that felt like grinding, and I dont mean that in a negative way. I wanted to spend more time in an area that  requires you use heat resistant food/elixirs so I went to a snow field where i know there are many chill-shrooms. 

I'm sure there is probably some clothing you can use to resist the heat but doing it this way was more fun, because for me at least going on an adventure is 1 thing, but having to do a little preparation for your adventure makes it way more fun. Its why I love the Monster Hunter games as they are all about prep. "
