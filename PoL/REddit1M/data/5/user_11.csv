22006,"No kidding. I was thinking about this the other day. Yeah, it sucked that my so-called rare weapons were starting to break like glass, but that forced me to really plan situations ahead and I found myself way more proficient with a basic shortsword now than I was with at the beginning of the game with a lucky find of, say, that strong Edge of Duality.

For an added challenge and totally not because I was being indecisive ~~(Statue? What Statue in Hateno?)~~, I spent most of the game with three hearts and a single stamina ring and I spent most of my time exploring and unlocking the map instead of progressing with the story and the dungeons.. and the game rewarded me for it! It forced me to either be more efficient (finding slopes and curves ledges to rest on while exploring), or more resourceful with the ingredients I'd find. And the game always rewarded me for it! 

Between finding random shrines, treasures, Koroks, or even tough enemies to conquer, I always felt more more secure about how I was coming along in the game, and it was the first time I ever felt a game represented my skill progressing as its player character, rather than through arbitrary stat upgrades.

Though my weapon luck was always weird, I'd find great heavy weapons, but have really shitty one handers and spears (and for the longest time I hated spears because even with the reach I felt like I couldn't kill stuff besides animals too well.. Turns out it was because I only had low powered harpoons).

Big thing (heh, get it) about using heavy weapons is their timing. They're GREAT for staggering and once I got an enemy conked out I would use my charge attack to finish them off and waylay anyone else trying to get in my way. I still have a soft spot for them, but being able to perfect guard with a shield definitely made one handed weapons a lot more preferable."
