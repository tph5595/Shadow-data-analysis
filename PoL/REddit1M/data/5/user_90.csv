50877,"So, from my experiences, I have all but the two soutwest tower regions on my map (havent done everything just going tower to tower)..
And I will cook food that gives my 20 hearts 16 + the 4 I have normally, and I still run into enemies that will do 12-18 hearts in one hit, its crazy. I wouldnt skip out on getting hearts/stamina. 

I have heard we will need those hearts eventually for something else also."
