48124,"to use the heavy weapons in the game you basically have to combo with some type of CC weapon first.  for this reason, the ice/lightning spears are the best weapons in the game.  poke once with CC, swap weapons using dpad, wail with huge damage, repeat.

this is a cheesy strategy i've stopped using cause it takes the fun out of many of the fights.  "
