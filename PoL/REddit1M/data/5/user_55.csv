33280,There is a silver lynel on top of the gerudo summit. It has to be a fixed spawn because I haven't beaten any lynels yet. After being rofl-stomped one time by one I just try to avoid them now ;_;
34397,The silver one has the stripes like a zebra right? That's what I saw I didn't get very close though. And I haven't fought any yet so I can't speak for the difficulty I'm just going off another post from yesterday where someone said silver lynel was the hardest enemy in the game. So I saw it and turned around the other direction XD
