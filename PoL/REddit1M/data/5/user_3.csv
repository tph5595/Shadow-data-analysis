34524,"Incremental stat increases are often disappointing. What RPGs can do, however, is offer skill unlocks, new attack patterns or bonuses to certain things.

To use the near-mandatory comparison, Horizon Zero Dawn has skill trees that net you stuff. More gathered materials, critical shots, limited slowed time when shooting with a bow. BotW has some of these kind of things as food, elixir or armour bonuses (stealth is one that immediately springs to mind!), some are inherent features that Link can use (slow time when using the bow in the air), and some are things that are unlocked through story progression. 

So it can be done boringly (stat gains), interestingly (skill trees) or natively (armour and story progression). Just cause Dark Souls kinda borked it doesn't mean it's necessarily a bad thing. I'm still very glad it's not in BotW though!"
