45326,"What happens after beating Ganon? I'm curious because I see myself continuing to play after I finish the main quest to try and 100% the game, but I heard someone say it just reloads the last save you had before you beat Ganon? That sounded weird but idk."
45608,Uh... I've been selling those and haven't upgraded my runes yet. Am I screwed?
48519,Well shit
50001,"I'm almost at 3k, I was trying to get the house in Hanten village or whatever the name is. I've only done 1 DB so far."
50216,Yep I just found it. Apparently you can store weapons and gear there once you buy it.
55696,"Yeah I've found some Korok seeds, but not that guy yet. I think I'm supposed to know where he is already and just missed it or something. I should go talk to the Maraca guy again."
60533,"Ah ok. That's cool I guess.

It would be nice if the game acknowledged that the Calamity was beaten and things could start going back to normal, I'm guessing NPCs aren't built to do that so that's probably why they handled it like that. Maybe they'll add that in the DLC."
