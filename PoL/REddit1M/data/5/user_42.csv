29268,That sounds terrifying. I've beaten Ganon already and I'll still run from a Lynel for dear life. An upgraded one is just nopeville.
41979,"What kills me though is that even the bosses are cake compared to some overworld enemies. Like I hate to say it but even Calamity Ganon gave me practically no trouble when I figured him out, yet I've still never killed a Lynel."

You'll start picking up on mechanics that'll help keep you alive, and I would say you really only need to grind about 5 stamina vessels to be able to explore pretty much wherever (barring hot/burning or freezing places). I avoided most combat unless I was in a particularly killing mood or had to fight."
82422,I wasn't even aware there was one in the castle. I abused the hell out of [Revali's Gale](/spoiler) to get to the top quick after I nabbed the [Hylian Shield](/spoiler).
