30459,"Enemies seem to have a ""level"" that is relative to that archetype's current baseline.  Soooo lets say I avoid stuff in early game, in a more difficult zone, a moblin might be set to be 2 steps above the baseline goblin. If, however, I killed all the moblins I seen, it would raise my baseline moblin ""level"", and that same moblin in the same more difficult zone would still be two steps above whatever my current baseline is.  Easier zones use baseline enemies, and tougher zones are probably assigned a ""+"" modifier.  Enemies in Lost Woods may be baseline+3 or something."
