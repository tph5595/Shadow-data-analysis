Their dps is usually pretty similar, but really with heavy weapons dps should be higher, since there is the penalty of slow swings, it would always be better to use a faster weapon instead.

And then there are spears, which are faster than shortswords, and have fantastic reach. I'd take a nice spear over Edge of Duality any day.

Heavy weapons are actually really great for stealth kills, though."
