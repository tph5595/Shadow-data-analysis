36805,"See, here's the kind of thing I'm thinking they should've done. You go into the mountain region. There's a town that's been ransacked. They have to stay by fires, all their warm clothes were taken by the moblins that came through, or Yiga clan, or whatever. Also, they kidnapped the one man who knew how to make warm clothes. Can someone save him? You have a choice. You can go rescue this man, save the town, and also obtain warm clothes, or screw him, take on the main quest, and eat peppers. There's a reward for the side quest. It's not necessary, but it feels very satisfying and has a nice reward to it. "
