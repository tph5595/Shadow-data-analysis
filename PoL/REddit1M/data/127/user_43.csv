86434,there is no reason that a game from 17 years ago (majoras mask) should have better side quests than a game from 2017. i just think nintendos being lazy.
86642,"but in previous zelda games they were able to give pieces of heart, some of thoses involved a character generating a so much love that they create a piece of heart or in the yeti's case, they created a heart container. and in skyward sword you could make people so happy, that their gratitude literally crystalizes and you can collect it"
87806,"no not at all. in majoras mask they created events within quests on top of the world, for example, the romani ranch quests had you go to a specific location at night (the ranch) and then kill a bunch of aliens, then you escort romanis older sister to clock town, the game creates an interesting scenario for interacting with npcs, in botw however, you have quests where you just mundanely collect things, or look for things that either dont do anything or unlock just another shrine that most likely turns out to be a blessing shrine. ive seen your comment where you said you enjoyed the eighth heroine quest, but why? sure its probably cool to find a giant statue alone in a cold mountaintop (especially if you havent seen it in the trailers) but it doesnt do anything, its just there for you to take a picture of and say ""wow that looks cool""

in botw you dont get anything worthwhile from quests, while in majoras mask helping people, being a hero like link is supposed to be, gives you a cool reward. if anything the exploration aspect should improve upon quests greatly. instead of having to take  a picture of the statue, what if you found ruins at the foot which lead to a dungeon of some kind and you find something better than some boots. the fact that the world is so big means theres more potential for even greater stories than the ones told in the majoras mask quests. hell, look at witcher 3, its bigger than botw and it has fantastic sidequests. 

so i repeat, nintendos being lazy."
93318,"majoras mask is just an example. witcher 3, elder scrolls and several others are also good examples of good sidequests in open world. "
93338,link is technically a super being in all games. hes the chosen one.
