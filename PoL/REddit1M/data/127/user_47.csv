But the minigames are forgettable and bad. Pay rupees to maybe get more rupees. I guess that's what happens when you eliminate quivers, bomb bags, heart containers, and wallets as potential rewards. There's nothing really compelling left.

And none of the games themselves were unique or fun by themselves. I boot up TP to play Roll Goal on occasion, because Roll Goal is fun by itself. Paying to take a Cuccoo down into Lake Hylia is worth it, because it's a fun thing you couldn't do otherwise. What does BotW have to shake things up? I can ride my horse or go shield surfing without paying you twenty rupees."
105385,"Dude, I made like three points there. Which is *the* point? 

1. Sidequests are worth it because helping people is worth it.

2. Minigames suck because the rewards suck.

3. Minigames suck because they don't offer opportunities to do fun things you couldn't otherwise.

And how do any of those relate to the freedom to choose?"
106801,"Don't worry, you remembered the Eventide minigame right. 

But it's not really a choice when one option is ""do a thing"" and the other is ""pay someone to do the exact same thing"". I can paraglide from literally anywhere. I can shoot arrows in any combat encounter I wish. Why would I ever travel to a specific location, pay someone, and do those things for rupees, a near worthless reward?

 A better choice is ""keep playing my adventure game"" or ""let's do something different"". I can't play that STAR minigame without paying the sleazeball who made it impossible without the Clawshots. Which means I can choose to ignore that possibility entirely or change up the gameplay on a whim. It gives me a reason to go to that place and pay that guy, even beyond just the reward.

You're right about the bags/quivers/wallets being gone making for a better main game, but the minigames suffer because there's no reason to bother with them. They *cannot* give me anything unique or special. The games themselves are just the same mechanics you already have, and they don't give you anything cool for doing them. "

Like, maybe you'd get a shield designed for shield surfing if you rock the shield surfing minigame. Absolutely garbage in combat, but no better shield for surfing in the game.

Or a bow for the paragliding minigame that's decent, but has a skill to reduce the stamina cost of slowing down time."
