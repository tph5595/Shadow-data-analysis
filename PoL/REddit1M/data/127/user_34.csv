37972,"&gt;As we all know, side quests in BOTW are sort of ""forgettable"", plus they have horrible rewards.


I think they're fun, and some of them led to useful rewards, [helping build Tarrey Town gives you access to the armor salesman. The sand/snow boot sidequests. Helping all the gerudos for access to the ThunderHelm](/spoiler) Those all seems like fine rewards to me. The additional lore and personalities was fun too. To each their own."
