They're meant to be a helpful nudge that pushes you out into the world, not something you want to grind out over all else. If the rewards are massive, they risk tempting players to beeline right to the objective and then right back to the quest giver. 

Big rewards would be a terrible fit for BotW. "

If Nintendo had done what other open world games have done, we'd have had the bloated, procedurally-generated mess of other open world games, only with a Zelda skin. As someone who can't stand those games, I'm glad they went a different route.

Nintendo gets that play and the experience are the reward (or at least they did this time), and they built the game accordingly."
