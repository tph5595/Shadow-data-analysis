13593,I keep forgetting about the lack of bugs.  Thank you for bringing that up.  I can justify some of the barren and emptiness in the game with how seamless it plays.  I'm still salty about the lack of enemies though.

30617,"Hmmm, I guess I can look forward to getting it on Switch.  Would you recommend playing it on a console, or should I save up for a better PC?"

What I'd really like is modding BotW.  I'm sure that eventually the emulation scene will lead to it.  There's so much I'd like to see done in BotW's engine (making new characters, enemies, dungeons; hell, even remaking old Zelda games in that engine)."
