88902,"But MM's game design _only_ worked because of very specific mechanics they implemented.  Nobody has the computational power (then or now) to run fully realized ""living"" NPCs across an indefinite amount of time, so MM got away with it by enclosing the player in a time loop, which enabled the NPCs to have a schedule and move around in a very lively way while giving a definite end point.  Many quests in MM simply could not work in a world that didn't work this way, and obviously BotW doesn't have a world like that.

nomadthougts was correct here: it's not an issue of laziness but of prioritization.  You can do only a finite number of things and each additional feature requires something else be cut, _and_ you need to build a game world that has proper synergies between gameplay, ""level"" design, and mechanics/systems.  The types of sidequests you want simply don't fit without major changes -- enough of them to make a game quite different from BotW.  

They certainly could have done more with the sidequests and rewards, but they're not lazy for failing to uphold the MM standard."

It takes a special kind of player to not be able to name even one of them."
