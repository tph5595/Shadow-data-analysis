43500,"Yeah I definitely figured the same thing while playing.  It seems dumb that I loved the ""find my cuckoos"" sidequest in OoT when it got me a bottle, but when I did it in BoTW it felt like a chore because all I got were rupees.

Your logic here hits on two greater criticisms I have of the game:

1) The idea of ""we need to make Zelda more realistic"" is dumb.  I think that the sidequest thing you mentioned is the worst of changes in the name of realism, but there are forsure some others.  When climbing in SS, you lost stamina based on the distance climbed.  So- fast climbing 100 feet takes as much stamina as slow climbing 100 feet.  The result? I fast climbed everywhere.  In this game, fast climbing requires more energy, so I'm always slow climbing.  It is needlessly tedious.  Same goes for the ""you can't climb when it's raining"" phenomenon.  This is a hassle and adds nothing to the game.  Another instance: your horse will only come to you if he/she is in earshot or you go to a stable.  This just means I never use the horse b/c it is tedious.  There is no need for realism in a cartoon fantasy game about giant ancient robot animals and an evil pig.

2) There is just too much stuff to do in BoTW.  At face value, this is not even a criticism- and to some level it is hard to say there is too much of a good thing.  The reality is, when you have hundreds of korok seeds, 120 shrines, a bunch of memories, dozens of weapons + clothes + food, and scores more sidequests with different random rewards... I forget what stuff I even did.  In other games, the rewards were so valuable that even a boring quest was worth it in the end.  In this game, there is no way to make so many collectables useful, so they just aren't.  Clothes, weapons, and food sometimes stay in your inventory until you finished the game and you never even use them.  I can farm money or meals much faster than by doing quests.  You only need to collect like 1/3 of the game's korok seeds-
 the rest are meaningless.  When playing, I felt sad that we could have probably had two full zelda games with the content of BoTW, and they wouldn't suffer from this content-overload problem."

It's not just the rain concern (that many others voice) it's a ton of stuff that ostensibly makes the game ""more realistic"" while really just making it more tedious.

As for the ""game is empty"" criticism- I think that is also a fair criticism.  Saying that there is too much to do and that the world is kinda empty are not mutually exclusive.  If I have to travel a far distance to engage with the game (by way of shrine/quest), that starts to suck after a while.  If the world has a ton of quests with little meaning and these quests are spread out sparsely over a large distance, that's not a winning formula.

I want to also say that I generally liked the game and I'm happy that Nintendo took some risks- I just think it has flaws and I want to voice them."
