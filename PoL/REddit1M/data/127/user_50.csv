You're rushing it.  It's not supposed to be like the other games, rewards and items are not the highlight, it's the adventure.  I'll admit, I approached it the same way, ready to be excited about what I could find that would give me the ability to do more. Botw does satisfy these urges with things like champion abilities, and upgraded climbing gear, but it offers other things that no other LOZ game ever has, and they are also enjoyable"
