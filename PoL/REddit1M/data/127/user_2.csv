1438,the simple answer is laziness.  they rushed the game out and as a result: meaningless side quests
1931,"despite the big open environment, there is very little actually there.  handful of villages, handful of copy/paste characters, meaningless quests and virtually no story, lack of powerful music aside from like one village, shrines/towers/stables that are all the same albeit a slight variation from the previous, enemies just upgrade to a new tier of difficulty instead of new enemies entirely.  the rest of the game is just collect a bunch of something to give an armor more stats.  these are all symptoms of a rushed game "
2336,"dont get me wrong its a great game, its just not what i expect from a zelda game.  "
2405,anju and kafei from majoras mask.  biggoron sword from ocarina of time.  
2729,if anyone can do it its the zelda team.  not my fault they failed to match the quality of previous games in the series
3611,Theyre not.  botw has one real side quest - terry yown
12276,"skyward sword has major flaws but it also has well designed dungeons, characters, music, and environments.  oh and it has a story"
12530,i do enjoy botw.  its just nothing like previous games.  too much is missing.  i couldnt even tell you the name of a character from the game since most of them were generic and uneventful.  i guess there was the traveling bird guy
13183,not my fault the characters in the game were forgettable because they weren't attached to any meaningful story arc
13504,bolson and kaas were the only two that seemed connected to anything major.  even beedle didnt do anything but sell stuff.  at least in other games he had something unique
