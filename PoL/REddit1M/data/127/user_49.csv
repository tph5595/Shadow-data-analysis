6756965,"I always figured BotW had one main idea fueling all of the quests and rewards, main game and side quests: it's about the journey not the destination. The game is about the experience it gives you, not the rewards you get for completing the tasks. The quests are there for the experience you get for them, the reward you get from them is getting to do them essentially. Yeah maybe collecting a bunch of frogs or mushrooms isn't exactly a riveting adventure, but small things like this push you further into the world Nintendo has given to us to explore. I think this can apply to almost every aspect of the game. For finding all 900 koroks you get a piece of shit, it doesn't do anything, it's just there. The reward for finding the Koroks was really just the fun you get from it, and if you don't wanna do it it's 100% optional. Even the ending of the main quest (SPOILER) is unsatisfying, especially if you did all the other main quests. Calamity Ganon is easy and the Dark Beast Ganon fight is a joke, and while I was personally upset about this it made me realize that beating Ganon and beating the game wasn't the real reward, it was just an objective that got me to go into the world and see what it had to offer, which is the true reward in my eyes. I didn't buy this game to beat Ganon, I bought it to play it all. The destination is inconsequential because the journey was so amazing. After all the focus of this game is obviously the world itself. That doesn't mean I'm necessarily okay with what Nintendo did with quest rewards and and the ending of the game, but it does give me hope that future installments will follow BotW's example and improve on it's flaws. This is a new start for Zelda, and it can only get better with future games taking the best from both this new formula and the old one. "
