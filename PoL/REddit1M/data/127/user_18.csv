18030,"I think what disappointed me more about some of the sidequests was how.. literal they were? It's a small thing, but in some situations I'd prefer a cryptic clue for extra satisfaction when we're right about the thing that they want, rather than ""I really want some raw gourmet meat."" The Kass quests are cryptic which is nice, I just wish there was a bit more ""figuring things out"" with some of the other NPC side quests as opposed to very obvious fetch quests.

Edit: Another example is the ""find a Goron/Gerudo/Zora/Rito whose name ends with 'son'"" thing. I liked that, it wasn't quite as straightforward unless you'd memorized everyone's names and locations."
