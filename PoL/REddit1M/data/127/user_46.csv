(the ones that are harder to find) Again I'm fine with some shrines being easier. I wish the puzzles were also rated' minor' 'average' or 'major' like the tests of strengths. Still an awesome game but for me that would be a significant improvement and still appeal to everyone"
100386,imagine having to transport a fresh milk across hyrule without fast travel. now there's a fun quest

I thought the rewards were way better than most quests in other Zelda games, which often give you 300-500 rupees as a reward for most quests, that you can't actually hold in your wallet because of a really limited max rupee wallet, or a piece of heart you didn't need because they were handed out like candy and you never died anyway  

I found the sidequests fun to do regardless of the rewards tho

107973,"I was referring to puzzle difficulty in terms of challenge to your MIND, not physical challenge. When I say difficult puzzles, I am saying mentally they are hard to figure out for your brain - not difficult to execute on a controller. 

But that's not even my main point - what I'm saying is the shrines that you come across your path should stay on the easier side for players like him,  but if your dad is that bad at these things, he's not going to find over 50% of the the shrines in the game anyway, so why can't just those hidden ones be difficult? He would still have an enjoyable experience with the more obvious shrines in the game as he is now. I don't think making 30-40 of the more hidden shrines into really difficult puzzles would hurt his experience. You have to be good at the game to find those shrines in the first place.   

For example, one shrine requires you to stasis freeze a boulder and hit it at the perfectly angle across a small canyon to break apart a wall revealing a shrine. From your description its unlikely he would even find this shrine due to the precision required to aim the hits on the stasis object . So why not make the puzzle inside more difficult (again, mentally difficult, not physically) They could have catered the game to appeal to everyone by varying the shrines, but IMO the puzzles only cater to the newer players."
