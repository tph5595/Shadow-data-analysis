9530,"900 korok seeds isn't exactly a good way to show the game wasn't rushed. They took like 5-6 puzzles, then hit copy and paste all over the map."
9857,"Majora's medium is so much better for side quests, I almost feel it's unfair to judge them.. 

Anju and Kafei have a truly unique story and there are a huge number of different ways that A+K side quest plays out, each of them heartbreaking in their own way. The characters are much more interesting and mysterious.  

I think TT was great and the game could have used more of it, but Majora's Masks side quests were real pieces of art."
10488,"A bit of hyperbole, but for korok seeds, yes. There are 5-6 different types of puzzles and they just put them all over the place so that people could find all different ones. 

That's why you stop upgrading after you collect half of them, because they are meant to be expendable. I don't hate korok seeds (though I stopped collecting them after a while) but to say they are a matter of precise planning is a stretch."
10624,"This pretty much encapsulates the problem with rigidly following any philosophy, and, imo, an illustration of the problems with BotW.

""It's real, but that doesn't make it interesting."""
11365,"I am korok seed guy.  Yes, of course those puzzles are not literally copy and paste. That's why I said it was hyperbole. But after I had 15 I never was like ""oh man, I wonder how to solve this."" To me it does feel very rushed to just throw them all over the place, but it could just be design I don't like.

As for the whole game, it's good. Just a very shallow experience. I think the next will be much better."

27040,Kass was doing a lot of heavy lifting. A highlight of the game 
27206,Not only skyward sword though. It's like Zelda1 without the dungeons. 
27338,"Because there are no others. Leviathan bones was cool I thought, but my honey moon phase ended when I found the hebra mountain one. To open that thing and find only a shrine.. "
32050,I liked that part too. But finding minor tests in the late game was really lame.
