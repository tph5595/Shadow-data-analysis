As much as I like Breath of the Wild and some of the changes it has brought to the series I still feel like it lacks a lot of what made previous Zeldas what they were. Still, if the next installments in the series takes pointers from games old and new, we could have something truly amazing again. Not that Breath of the Wild wasn't amazing."
35871,"Like /some/ of the old ones. Think of the spark that made such games like Wind Waker, Link's Awakening, or Majora's Mask so special. I feel like music was definitely something that Breath of the Wild truly needed, but didn't deliver on even though they were going for a broken, minimalistic feel. Also, the magic meter NEEDS to return. "

I feel like this game really dropped the ball with most of its NPCs, sadly. Only a handful actually seem memorable unlike in Majora's Mask."

As for Revali (Falco), he was a dick... but it's nice to see some characters dislike Link once in a while too. :P The plot of Breath of the Wild was weak, but at least it made up for it in exploration. Now if the rewards for exploration were more worth it then that would have been better. "
84368,What about Mipha? :P

86339,"Not really but I liked her as a character. That is, I still feel like we could have had more moments with the champions in the game that would have solidified our bond to the characters."
86788,"I do, actually. In fact, I did Naboris first before the rest of the areas and was slightly disappointed in how little there was to do for the main plot after the desert. All Divine Beasts were a cakewalk after that. ):"
