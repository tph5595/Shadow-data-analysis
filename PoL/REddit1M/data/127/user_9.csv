10835,Match the quality of previous games?  Sorry but not every Zelda game before this was a home run.  Some like SS straight suck.  
12448,"Well designed dungeons?  Man I can't remember much about those at all, they were boring as hell.  Characters?  Lol again no, save for Groose.  Music?  Yeah, this game has great music too.  Environments?  Lmao no contest between SS and BotW.  BotW has a story too, you just don't like it.

You don't like the game and that's fine, but don't pretend like it's some shit Zelda game compared to all the others before it.  "

13280,There's a difference between that and being literally unable to name a single one.  You clearly just didn't pay attention.  
13750,"So you were using intentional hyperbole when you said you couldn't name anyone?  Yeah when you have to do that to make your case, you got nothing.  "
21980,"Uhhh when you simplify things like that you can make every Zelda story sound bad.  ""Go kill Ganon"". ""Ok"""
