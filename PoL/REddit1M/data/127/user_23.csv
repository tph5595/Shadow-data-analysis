It kind of brings up the question of what makes a Zelda game a Zelda game. Breath of the Wild was an amazing open world game, but if you were a huge fan of Zelda games in the vein of Skyward Sword, I could see someone being disappointed since Breath of the Wild is literally the exact opposite of Skyward Sword in so many ways. 

With a series that's been going on for this long, it's inevitably going to change along the way, so I think it can get harder and harder to please everybody."

(That's not to say the Gameplay is SS was bad or the story in BoTW was bad). I liked Ocarina of Time more than Skyward Sword too because of the gameplay and stuff. I feel like it kind of comes down to what you value most in games."
