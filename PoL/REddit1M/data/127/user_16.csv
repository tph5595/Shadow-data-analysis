Both have lots of interesting, smaller items, such as the monster cake or the Necluda shield; items that don’t change the game if you get them, but are still enjoyable. They could have created a bunch of these smaller items exclusively for side quests. 

For example:

1. The Kakariko cooking kid could have given you special ingredients, that you can only get from her. Nothing powerful, something like baby carrot or baby pumpkin, that can be used to make cookies.
2. The Hateno weapon kid could have given you his grandpa’s sword, or even his own toy sword. Again, a special item that isn’t powerful, but gives you a sense of accomplishment for completing the side quest.
