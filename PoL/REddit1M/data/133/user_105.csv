45300,"Hah, reminds me of my experience with Zelda.  My babysitter (a guy, probably about 18 y/o) suggested that I get OoT when I got my N64.  I had no idea what I was getting into.  I was so excited when I got the Kokiri Sword, I thought that was the end of the game.  Then I found out you could leave Kokiri Forest...but I was young and didn't understand, and the game was too scary.  I had him beat it for me while I watched.

Then I started a new save file and I was scared shitless when I had to sneak past the guards to get to Zelda.  I felt like something bad would actually happen when they caught me.  So I was stuck there for a long time.  Eventually I got the courage to keep going and ended up playing through the game 5+ times. 

By the time Majora's Mask came around I pretty much knew what I was doing.  Got all the masks but I got too frustrated trying to find the faries in each dungeon, so I never got the great fairy sword.  I did get the upgraded hearts and magic bar, I can't remember what the other thing was though.

I'm also 20 now, my favorites were MM&gt;OoT&gt;TP.  I was never a fan of the windwaker, I think I just didn't like the cartoony style or the boat.  I don't think I ever beat it."

The only games I've enjoyed for the story near the level of the Zelda series are LA Noire and the Mass Effect Series."
