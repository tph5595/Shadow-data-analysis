58579,"This opinion might be unpopular, and I want to add, that I did play the game when it came out and have not played it since then, but:
I didn't like Majoras Mask.

And yes, I've completed the game with a 100%, since I wouldn't have to answer to ""you didn't play it all the way through!"" and I really wanted to experience the whole thing ;)

For me, I didn't like the distanced atmosphere and the ""everything is a time limit"" mechanic.

You could not build a ""relationship"" to characters, since every character in town did forget you after the time reset.

This is minor, but also that after working your ass of to get the ultimate final mask, you can only use it during the end-boss fight - what a let down.

Recently I came to understand how one can like it, since it is a very fresh break from the usual Zelda formula and leaves much room for interesting theories and interpretations of the events and places pictured in the game but I just could not like it.

It didn't feel right."
