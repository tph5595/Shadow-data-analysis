4875,"I remember as a kid people disliked majoras mask because they thought it was much more difficult than OOT. Cry me a river. seriously? It's ridiculous complaints like this that have led nintendo to dumb down recent installments of zelda. Since when is zelda supposed to be  a game without a challenge? Saying you don't like majoras mask because of the time limit is like saying you don't like zelda 2 because when you die you start from the beginning. Call it cheap difficulty, I personally feel that it forces the player to become more skilled at the game. It also makes it more rewarding to beat the game. If you haven't beaten majoras mask because of it's ""difficulty"", then go play SS and have Fi tell you what to do in case you forget that bombs blow up walls."

To complain about new installments in a franchise is perfectly legitimate . especially for a series with such a high quality like zelda. Sure whatever Nintendo does not ""owe"" me personally anything, but that does not mean I am forbidden from giving my opinion. Zelda games are challenging in my opinion because historically they have been challenging. If I wanted to play something easy I would."
