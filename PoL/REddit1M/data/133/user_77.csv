There isn't any loss, there isn't much of a rush... It just doesn't feel doomed in the least once you save the realm from twilight.  There's life everywhere and people are all happy, living their unworried lives (for the most part)."
30859,I think part of the beauty of these old games is the glitches.  They add so much depth to learning the game beyond the basics that almost anyone can get into.  I love learning speedrunning techniques.
