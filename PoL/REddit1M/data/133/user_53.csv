24416,"From a game design perspective, my only criticism of the Keife quest is that the first event in the 3 day chain of events, has an extremely short time window in which you can activate it.  I would argue that this is why it is overlooked by most players except those with guides.

If you had the first event EASY to activate then the SECOND event is the tricky one to start, you may have more people picking up the bread crumbs on the quest.  However, the later in the 3 day cycle a 'narrow' interaction window occurs, the more wildly frustrating it is to miss.  I may have decided to change it, but in the end it may not matter.  It's still a very complicated quest either way and good for the MM team for including it.  It's conclusion is my most emotional moment in gaming."
24511,"As a kid, I never fully understood or used the bomber's notebook.  My recent play-through - the notebook almost made it too easy."
24973,"Yes, MM is more about the side-quests than the main plot.  Makes you wonder when the groundhog's day like time limit was introduced into the design:

Was it as a result of the crashing moon idea?

Or was a core goal of the title to have a living, breathing town?  The only way to achieve the feeling of a living breathing town would be to create a heavily scripted schedule of events, complex enough to feel realistic.  In order to experience all of it, a repeating time mechanic needs to be introduced.  Why would we go back in time? Ooh! the moon...

Similarly, I wonder if they intended for this title to be so dark, or if that's just what it developed into.  The core themes are of death, depression, and coming to terms with these things - healing.  But if you look at the time travel - this poor area is stuck in a twisted purgatory where only one area of Termina is ever 'healed' (actually, I admit I warp and beat all 4 dungeon bosses on my final 3 day cycle.  Makes me feel like I'm truly helping Termina).  Super gutsy move on Nintendo.  Every LoZ game since has felt.... 'safe.'  Twilight Princess is quite dark, but it's not as heavy as MM."
25710,"Having Link be immediately transformed into the Deku scrub is genius and is intended to have very interesting emotional effects on the player.  During the first 3 days, everyone hates the Deku scrub: the dog, the bombers don't trust him, etc.  This serves to introduce the player to the darker world of Termina where racial subtext has implications like no other LoZ title.

In my opinion, the long intro sets the stage quite nicely by giving it mysterious, blurry context with OoT and follows an intense story beat where right before resolving - WHAM! ""You're no longer the Link you know, how does that make you feel player?""  Yes, it is annoying on a second play-through, but there is nothing more important than eliciting the designed emotions in the first 5 minutes of a players 1st play-through."
26153,"I completely agree with that annoyance; however, my recommendation is to push on.  You'll notice the game is designed to be VERY generous in terms of replenishing your items. While on Woodfall, wherever you warp, there are those green guys jumping around and tall grass.  Slash these and before you know it, magic and ammo, full (forget what you should have by now, but you get the idea).  Once you have the ability to travel quickly through Termina without warping (weird phrasing due to possible spoilers), you will auto-kill and pickup magic from the green slime guys.

On top of all that, it's intended that you finish a temple in a single 3 day cycle, so whenever you're at Dawn of the New Day, items just aren't THAT essential.  You're pretty much starting the next chapter of the game anyways."
26893,"Hmm.  It's interesting to think about.  I don't think I immediately noticed it as a kid.  I actually thought MM was 'kiddier' that OoT due to some of the more exaggerated art style on the buildings.  However, I did get a more depressing 'feel' while playing the game.  It kept building until I got to the ranch quest.  I had to put the game down for a few minutes.  It felt like a bad dream.  Then it's when it hit me.  The entire theme of the game is meant to feel like a nightmare.  Then I was able to really understand the true meaning of the game from there."
27035,"Whenever I'm asked to rate my favorite Zelda, MM is tied with OoT.  They are apples and oranges.

OoT is an EPIC

MM is a DRAMA

They are both about as close to perfections as you can get within the Zelda franchise (and...well....gaming, IMO)."
27922,"THIS THIS THIS!!! Oh man, when I think MM, I think of this music.  If you can't recall it, hit this link in a new tab before reading the rest of my post:

Ok, here's why I think this song is so key to the experience.  It's your first play-through, you have an idea of what's going on, moon crashing -GOT IT!  You've befriended the bombers, slogged through an underground dungeon, fought a few skulltulas, and emerge into this happy astronomer's observatory.

Now you look through the telescope and see the skull-kid with Majora's Mask.  About now, the music (and music people help me out), has a shift (major to minor? I'm grasping at straws).  But this shift is important, it's melancholy, it's dramatic.  After looking at the skull-kid, the camera looks at the moon, snarling, pressing down on Termina.  A meteor crashes down.  When you pick up the meteor, the old man explains that it is a moon tear.



The moon is crying.




Do you hear the music?


Holy shit.  Even the enormous metaphor for impending and inevitable death is weeping for its role in the fate of Termina.  This game man.  Fuckin.... I love this game.  This and Oot are why I'm a game designer."
29145,"Yeah, the extra dimension bit just makes it so much heavier.  I posted a long comment about 8 months ago diving into my theory that Link, having gotten lost in the Lost Woods searching for Navi, is slowly and excruciatingly turned into a skull-kid.  It is entirely possibly that this is all Link's personal purgatory, a bitter end for the child timeline's hero of time.

What especially makes me sad, is that SS came extremely close to capturing the magic of OoT (I would even accept arguments that it DOES capture the Oot magic).  But I don't see Nintendo ever making a LoZ game this heavy ever again.  If they do, so much can go wrong with modern game development... (""oh, they want it dark and sad? dark...and...gritty?.... Oops we ruined it."")"
38317,"Eh, I meant Epona and using the Goron mask.  Didn't want to spoil anything, but other people have talked about it, and it's pretty minor."
38568,"Yeah, or on the final night when Cremia invites little Romania inside and says she's allowed to have some milk before bed.  Mind you, milk is often used as an analogue for Alcohol in the Zelda universe (i.e. the Milk Bar).  Cremia knows the world is ending, and is trying to ease the experience for Romania....."
38658,"Well, you're not necessarily replaying the same parts of the game, but I totally understand what you're saying.

To me, I've replayed MM more than OoT simply because I perceive it to be a shorter game (though now that I think of it, I'm not sure that it is)."
38750,"Well, they keep trying to emulate the OoT formula, not MM."
39153,"Right, I agree.  I believe the context of the narrative of TP is dark - world slipping into darkness due to the failed Ganondorf execution while the twilight realm has been equally negatively effected by this; however, this darkness is not a dynamic plot element."
