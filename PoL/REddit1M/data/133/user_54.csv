24556,"I'm currently playing through Majora's mask now a days. My main complaint would be that it feels more like an expansion or DLC to OoT rather than an independent LoZ game with it's own game engine. Seeing the same NPC models kinda ruined the feeling for me. Also: I enjoy the story, but the lack of Zelda and Hyrule in general is kind of sad I think. The classic OST and the romance/friendship between Link and Zelda is what gives the story somewhat a nostalgic feeling and emotional boost."
