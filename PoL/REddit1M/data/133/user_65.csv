26479,"I've known about the slowing time and bank since it came out.  I like talking to everyone the first play through, learned it's very useful from playing RPGs.  I honestly didn't care for the story though.  It kinda seems like they made the story around the game, and not the other way around.  Plus when you look at it without the 3 day reload time, it's the shortest LoZ game ever.  4 dungeons, and no real reason to go back to them after you're done.  I've actually been able to 2 dungeons in one 3 day period.

I'll admit the side quests are great, and the mask collection was fun, but I don't know if serves a relevant point to the main story other than being able to get the [Fierce Deity mask](/spoiler) and by that point you're at the end of the game.  Plus beating the last boss without is still pretty easy if you upgraded your swords."
