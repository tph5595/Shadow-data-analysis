30536,"I enjoyed how the time-limit gave us, the player, a sense of real urgency. It felt more realistic in that I couldn't just leave myself to wander and do other things at my own leisure pace while there is a clear and present danger *literally* just looming above me. It can be a hassle if you're more accustomed to traditional Zelda games. Certainly, I can see myself getting annoyed if they implemented this for *every* Zelda game. But the change of pace for MM was really enjoyable for me.

To put it in other words; In OoT I could sit on top of Epona all day in Hyrule Field and there's no sense of urgency at all. It's like going through a laundry list. Sure, Ganondorf is off doing his own evil laundry list, but that's off in some far away place in some far away land that I'll just clean up later when I have time. In the mean time, LET'S GO FISHING YEAH."

Right off the bat, I can think of a scenario. If you spend all your time doing the Anju/Kafei mission, you'll likely miss out on several events pertaining to other NPC's, such as defending the farm. If you opt to do those missions instead, you know in the back of your head that Anju/Kafei aren't going to get back together.

For every win you acquire, there's that many more losses. It's a burden. That's why I like MM."
