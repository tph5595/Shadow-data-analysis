24353,"That ""guy"" is a bank teller at a bank. That bank is going to collapse because Link will keep getting more money out than he should in each day (he brings them a ledger from three days that haven't happened yet, plus whatever else he made each 3-day cycle). Not that an economy where you can find currency in the grass would be that stable."
