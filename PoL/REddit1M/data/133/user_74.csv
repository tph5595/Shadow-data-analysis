29454,"Ha, this right here. I'm replaying the game for the first time in years and had to run through that quest twice. The first time I got all the way to the part just before Sakon's hideout and didn't have the hookshot (...holy fuck, it just occurred to me that I never needed the hookshot... gdi...) ANYWAY long story short I didn't complete it that time around and had to do it again. The second time around I got the Sun mask, ran back to Anju and then was super dismayed watching the time run out. I even paused the game and got online to see if I had missed anything. I did NOT want to do that fucking quest a third time. It was such a relief when Kafei finally came around.

Upshot is that I got both the Postman's hat and the bottle from the quest."

I wish there was an option to disable the time-travelling feature so that once a boss is killed and an area is cleared it would stay clear (would definitely make getting some heart pieces a LOT more convenient). It's a novel concept and I still love the story but the pressure caused by the time limit means I just can't stop and appreciate it like I can the other games."

There are quite a few side-quests and heart pieces to keep a player busy but yeah, with only four dungeons it does feel short. I personally like the game but can see why another person would hate it."
31096,"Yeah, pretty much. :( At least the first boss goes down very quickly with the golden sword, but Goht and Gyorg are tedious."
