177412,"I put off playing Majora's Mask for a long time because I always thought of it as a spin off of a Zelda game.  I finally played it about a year ago, and to me, I got exactly what I expected.  I still think it was an overall great game.  I think the dungeons and the side quests were great, as well as the characters and the story.  But I honestly still haven't finished it because it still just doesn't feel like Zelda. I felt the dungeon bosses didn't feel like they belonged in a Zelda game, and were all far too simple.  It just wasn't my cup of tea.  "
