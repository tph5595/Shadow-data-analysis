Now that you told me this, I'm going to try it again this weekend."

Retro games, the especially awesome ones, blow me away. Link's Awakening when I bought it was and still is one of my favorite Zelda games. I love a challenge in my games, just not one that requires me to complete the whole game before the timer runs out."

I'm very sad to say I was very used to waypoints at this time, and finding the group of town kids at the start was extremely frustrating. I didn't know you didn't beat the game, I assumed it was beaten after beating Skull Kid. Again, this weekend I'm trying the game over since I didn't really give it a fair shake."
