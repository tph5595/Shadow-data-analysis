24933,"This game brings me back.  I remember when I was 7 years old I was at my Uncles house and I watched him play a game that happened to be OoT, although at the time he just told me it was a Zelda game.  I told my parents I wanted that Zelda game, and that Christmas I got Majora's Mask, my first ever Zelda game, and I remember being too afraid to leave Clock Town that I would play cycles over and over just inside the Town.  I didn't beat the game until I was about 11 or 12 and had the courage to actually go outside Town.  Now I'm almost 20 and have played that game over and over countless times, and it was the first game I ever beat 100%.  Sorry if this really has nothing to do with the post but this game really brings back memories for me.  Although since then Twilight Princess has taken over the #1 spot in my heart.

But yeah to everyone, this game is awesome, and you should all give it a chance.  It's better that OoT in my opinion."
