8039,"MM was pretty cool. I loved finally getting up to Majora. My 'complaint' is that there were only four dungeons, and some of the bosses were a little silly (the fish?). I was kinda hoping that as you got new masks, new content would open in older dungeons (eg: swimming in the water in swamp temple), but the game is what it is and it worked. It was challenging, 100% completion was slightly ridick, but I would never change the game. 

Actually I do have a complaint that made me rage: How so many items were disabled when you shapeshifted. Why couldn't goron throw bombs? Why couldn't Zora use bow?"
