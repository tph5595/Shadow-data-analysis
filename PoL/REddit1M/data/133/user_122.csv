67682,That is a fantastic typo. Please leave it.
68051,"There is some point in OoT I think where you can get unlimited magic and then use Nayru's Love. I remember my brother kept getting his ass kicked by a pair of iron knuckles, so he got the bright idea to use that trick. Y'know how when they catch you on a horizontal swing, Link goes flying back and has to stand up again? Well, they backed him into a corner and the timing worked out painfully perfectly, so that the INSTANT Link stood up, he was sent flying by the other knuckle's swing. There was literally nothing my brother could do, he had to turn off the system.

After that, he finally let little sister play and I beat them, in spite of hardly being allowed to play throughout the game. :) Just sayin'."
