22242,"that observatory music, man. MM was probably the trippiest zelda game ever. I have to say as a kid I played that more than Ocarina. Refighting bosses was the shit too"
27769,it WAS! they really brought a lot to the table in that game. Not the same 'ol hack and slash boss fighting like in OoT since they had the games engine down. They were free to tweak with a lot more elements rather than worrying about developing the new engine. Definitely one of my favorites. I wish they had made more for N64 honestly
28600,"This is why I love MM even though others don't. OoT has a lot of radical theories all made from inferences, but MM's is in your face. Everything is completely screwed up, and the feeling of nearby doom is displayed the second you exit the clocktower. 

The whole alternate dimension just adds to the lost feeling, but it sucks you in to try and save that place not only for yourself, but also because everyone from OoT exists in this newfound dimension. None of the people remember you, but you (as the player) remember all their faces, and instantly feel pity and that you must be the hero again (since these people can't even build a 3 tier tower in under 3 days... And right when you approach the moment of the end, you get shot back to before, and have to suffer time and again until you stop the Moon. To me, it feels a lot heavier, since you really don't have any companions, no princess to help you, no saria to guide you, no Darunia to be bros with, no Ruto to make you feel awkward.

plus, the feels when you get the goron mask and zora mask. First time I saw someone actually die in the games (didn't discover unknown soldier in OoT until like a month ago after seeing a post).

But everything in this game is right in your face, and you gotta save it like the prepubescent hero of time that you lived up to be before. 

EDIT: I think Koume and Kotake seem familiar with Link, IIRC"
31094,"exactly!!!! There won't ever be a game in the series to match this one. I feel like a lot of people don't understand how heavy the game is, it doesn't truly get the attention it deserves. It's like the younger brother of OoT. It's newer, but it's still equally as good. The devs pretty much took another spin with OoT's engine, crafted a completely different feeling and story. I guess people didn't like that.

 If pokemon can get away with repetition in their engines, why not Zelda?!?"
