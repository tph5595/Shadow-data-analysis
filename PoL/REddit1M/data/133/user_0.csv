0,"Have you tried slowing down time? It doesn't get rid of the time limit, but it stretches it out giving you more time, letting things feel more like a regular Zelda game.

I know most of us knew about these tips, but I realized not everyone had the patience to talk to the scarecrow in the observatory.

I say this because someone recently posted about disliking MM, and they never knew you could slow down time. Therefore not allowing them to give MM a fair chance to be liked or not. I mean, it makes sense to not like a game cuz its unnaturally quick timeline. But to think its the only way to play could turn pff a loto people quickly.

Also you can save at owl statues, without resetting days.

Also you can store your money with that guy in West Clock town, so you can actually save."
2660,"It's why you have friends. and besides, kids back then had a lot more patience. Proof? look at Zelda 1"
2804,"Well to fix that, you store your money with that one guy. and other than that, you keep the masks, important items, and other things so that after you defeat a dungeon, even if you reset, you can go back to that dungeon quickly."
3183,Then I suggest hacking some grass. Surely that isn't too cumbersome.
21354,"Then get it for the gamecube, or wii, or hell even an emulator man."
22522,"That's the thing, the more dungeons you beat, even when you do start over, you can go explore the places you couldn't before, without having to do the same things again."
25206,you can save. You can save at the owl statues.
28885,"Never said it was the reason, I just thought it might be a reason. The reasons people dislike many things could be reduced to something simple."
31182,"Makes sense, you were raised in an instant gratification, unlimited retry, take your time video game world."
32487,"you dont' beat the whole game. Get Ocarina, go back in time. Beat first dungeon, go back in time. rinse repeat for all dungeons, and for however long you want to take getting the masks. You can save without going back in time, you use the owl statues. I don't know how much of this you knew but I personally never felt rushed."
33545,"&gt; I assumed it was beaten after beating Skull Kid.

Oh my dear sweet summer child. You have no idea what awaits you. Good luck!"
66522,Some people didn't like the game due to the time element. Feeling rushed.
66645,"Never said this tip was for everyone. For some this will fix one of the things that kept them even giving the game a fair shake. If they still don't like it, thats their perogative."
66830,Never assume anything is common knowledge. You have less chances to come off as an ass that way.
67001,"No seriously, some people didn't know. You'd be surprised at the amount of people who never beat the game cuz they felt rushed, and had no idea they could slow down time."
