12138,"Majora's Mask had a good story IMO because it was just so *dark.*

Everywhere you went, people were suffering horribly. The people of Clocktown were slowly realizing that the world was ending and that there was nothing they could do about it. The entirety of the Southern Swamp is poisoned, and and the Deku King blames an innocent monkey for it and threatens to *boil him alive.* The Gorons of Snowhead were slowly freezing to death, and their hero, Darmani, died trying to save them. The Great Bay's waters have become clouded and impossible to navigate for the Zoras, and Ikana Canyon is a kingdom where the inhabitants were brutally killed in war but continue to roam as vengeful spirits.

Ganondorf is called the ""King of Evil,"" but Twilight Princess is the only game where we actually see people suffering due to his actions (and even then it was assumed to be Zant until the very end). In Wind Waker he destroys Greatfish Isle, but we never see any of the inhabitants, if there were any besides Jabun. In Ocarina of Time he turns Hyrule Castle Town into a blasted hellscape, but we see that most of the inhabitants have fled safely into Kakariko Village."
