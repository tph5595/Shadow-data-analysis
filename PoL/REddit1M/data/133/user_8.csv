7712,"""Back then"" for MM and LoZ are very different times, haha. I had the patience for MM, but I was utterly lost going back to the first game. My brother, sister, mom, and I took turns playing that game, so we kind of spread out the discovery and experimentation over time.

For the Couple's Mask, there was a somewhat logical path to follow, if you paid enough attention to the schedule. As you worked through it, you'd get little snippets of information that let you solve the chain of puzzles, getting a little closer each time. I felt like the investigation and problem solvin is a central point of that game."
