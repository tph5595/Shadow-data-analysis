13635,"It seems Majora's Mask is a very ""love it or hate it"" kind of game, it certainly seems more divisive than any other Zelda besides maybe Wind Waker. 

I'm in the second group, so even though Ocarina of Time is my favorite Zelda of all time, I never actually finished Majora's Mask, at one point I just got frustrated and left. Since I do care about the Zelda lore, I watched a full playthrough on YT and I feel like that's enough. "
