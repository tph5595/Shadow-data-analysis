26510,"You're not alone my friend. I watched my mom and dad play the OG #1 and always wanted to play it myself. Looking back on it now, it's rather silly, ""Mom, can I play?""

""Not now honey, your father and I have to get through this labyrinth.""

We went so far as to draw up our own maps on graph paper, a technique I recently used playing LoZ: Parallel Worlds.

I will admit that the current games do offer a challenge to ANY player, but the kids these days don't know hard. Try walking into a room with 8 Dark Nuts with no place to hide and with an unstopping enemy vulnerable from only three sides."

27090,"What about Wind Waker, can we hate them too? I never cared for that one and everyone I tell that to is just floored. ""What?! You DIDN'T like it?""

""Yeah, I'm a part of this group, the SFDLWW (Society For Didn't Like Wind Waker). There's only 10 of us, but we have our meetings with coffee and donuts and we're ok with it."""
27458,Like the Giant Red Bull? That's a fun battle. It's like a demolition derby!!
27688,"Wind Waker remains the ONE LoZ I have played through ONLY once (not counting the hacked games, I don't hate myself enough to play those again). I've played through Z2 more than WW."
28216,"When my dad beat #1, and was greeted with a 2nd quest, he threw the controller in the air and walked away saying he'll never play another game again (this was back in the late 80's as you probably know) and he did, up until Pilotwings 64."
31313,I don't see why not.
103312,I'm just glad to hear such people exist. Nice to see differing opinions.
