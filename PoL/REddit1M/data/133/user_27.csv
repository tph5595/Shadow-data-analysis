I have NO idea how any one my age at the time (like, 10 or 12 or something) was supposed to figure that out on their own.  There were a HUGE number of seemingly unrelated steps requiring you to be at specific places for very small windows of time.

Now, last time I played this game was probably 10 years ago, so maybe when I was younger I was just stupid, but to this day it still sticks in my mind."
