25242,"I have a love-hate relationship with Majora's Mask. I *love* just how alive the whole world seemed and the dungeons were great, but I thought the time mechanics made things a thousand times more tedious. Every time you reset you'd go through the same motions of running around to regather rupees/ammo. And then if you mess up or come to a point where you can't pass yet in a sidequest, you're going to end up redoing all of the previous steps. 

You know that feeling of losing progress because you died and get sent to the title screen or your power went out and you hadn't saved in a bit? That feeling of how now you have to go through everything you just did again and you're just like ""fuck this. I don't even feel like playing anymore""? Majora's Mask was a constant battle through that feeling for me and it absolutely ruined my enjoyment of an amazing game. I recently watched a let's play of Majora's Mask and if the guy didn't cut and speed up the tedious parts I wouldn't even have been able to sit through him doing the same actions again and again."
