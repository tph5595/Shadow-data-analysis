22063,"Any time limit, at all, regardless of caveats, sucks to me. It limits my enjoyment because I feel pressured not to explore and have fun, do it at my leisure. Were I to explore, I'd have to save, and start again, working my way all the way back to where I was. And unless I'm _rushing_ to the temple from the start of the first day, I won't feel like I have enough time to complete the temple."
22379,"I finished, but I had to resort to a guide to do it, and I hate doing that. I feel so pressured in MM to hurry, so I feel like I need to plan every step in advance, lest time be wasted and I not finish the temple because time ran out.

I fucking ran out of time fighting the first world boss, and threw the controller and didn't come back to it for months. That was the N64 cartridge, my first play through. There's a seriously steep learning curve on this one."
24564,"Okay, with desperately trying not to sound like an elitist grandpa...

you kids, man. I cut my teeth on Zelda II, and that was on the gold cartridge in my NES. save states? Doesn't that mean if you die, you can flip back to mid battle and keep going from there? Or am I thinking of the other saves? 

I beat that bitch before LttP even came out, and the only way I could get past the firebird was by hiding in the corner and timing running out to avoid the fireballs...years later it's so much easier but it took me a month to beat it, and it wasn't a cheat or glitch, it was purely mechanical. By comparison Shadow Link was a piece of cake, I just crouched and kneecapped him to death,

Okay, I utterly failed in not looking like an elitist grandpa douchebag. I'm sorry."
24830,"While I understand, intellectually, it didn't change the mental pressure I felt with the clock tick-tick-ticking at me, which lessened the enjoyment for me.

what can I say, I suck at multitasking too, I guess it's just some people thrive under that kind of pressure; not me."

I don't know a moblin from a bokoblin from a bulbin.

darknuts? were those the armored knights that in Zelda II looked like the DC Comics version of Ares?

Yeah, those are darknuts.

Okay, to your point: Yes, I fully agree, to fucking hard. I didn't actually play and finish the original LoZ until this year, and I did it on emu. I'm so shamed. it was always too hard for me. And I never even bothered with the Zelda second quest."
37462,really? I was excited when I finally finished Mario and the princess offered me a new quest. Disappointed too when it was the same thing only faster enemies.
