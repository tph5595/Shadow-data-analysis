Or even if it is too much time, you can always talk to the scarecrow and dance til dawn."

It kinda gives it away, but otherwise it *would* be damn near impossible. It's genius that they thought to put that in."

And then I just restarted without either delivering Mama's letter to Kafei's mom or the postman, so I didn't get either reward, so now if I want *both* the bottle of milk and the postman's hat, I have to do it not only this time again, but *another* time after that. Jesus...."
