It happened to Sonic the Hedgehog '06, Sonic Adventure, and OoT. MM doesn't have nearly as many glitches, and while this rule eluded first-party games on Wii, Gamecube also had a few glitchy games, excluding Super Mario Sunshine. Super Monkey Ball had the most blatant exploits."
32216,"The Bomber's Notebook tells you what time you have interactions with people, so if you follow them, you can find where they are at that time of day, and you can figure out from clues what to do. It's the sort of game where you're supposed to talk to everyone while playing the game, at different times throughout the three days.

Source: My first time through the game, I acquired every mask without using a guide."

37158,"Of course, I just meant nothing useful. Mostly graphical glitches."
39300,"When you take into consideration how certain glitches in SM64 let you skip things, and how the same held true for OoT, graphical glitches mean nothing.

Sonic Adventure and Sonic the Hedgehog had physics and object glitches that made the game much harder than it needed to be."
70139,"Most of OoT's glitches are based on the environment. MM had a better-designed environment, so seam walking and the like didn't really help. In addition, the time limit of 3 hours per cycle made a lot of the exploits not worth trying to get."
70251,"Graphical glitches are unavoidable, and are everywhere. I didn't think they warranted mentioning since every game since NES has them."
