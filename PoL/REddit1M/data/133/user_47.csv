23436,"I would argue that other than heart pieces, OoT is just as much a collection game as MM. Same with pretty much *every* Zelda, or, at least, the ones I've played. The hearts are the only thing I can think of where you would need to do some extra collecting to get the same amount that you would by going straight through OoT. Otherwise it follows  almost the same formula as OoT as far as temples/item gathering goes."
23740,When you go back to play it again take this helpful advice as well: talk to *everyone.* That slow down time trick is taught to you by talking to the scarecrows.
23750,That and he's saying that liking MM more will get him downvoted. Its practically a proven point that /r/zelda adores MM more than OoT overall.

Not that I mind, cause its solidly in my rotating top 3, and gets bumped to each position based on which of the 3 I had played most recently."
38676,"I can see that. However, for me at least, the quest to get in to each temple was much more difficult/significant in MM than in OoT, and easily made up for only having 4 temples.

Plus, unlike OoT, for the most part, the side quests are actually meaningful, so I don't mind doing them. Selling happy masks in OoT depended quite a bit on just randomly talking to people while you were wearing the mask. The biggoron sword had more actual ""quest,"" but it still didn't really seem like it mattered."
