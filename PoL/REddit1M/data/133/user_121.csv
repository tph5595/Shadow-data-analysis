I truely appreciate what MM achieved in all of its intricacy and love how dense the game is, but the shear tediousness of everything makes it impossible for me to actually enjoy. It's like, I know I'd absolutely LOVE the game if it wasn't so flawed in this way, but it just so happens that the game is the way it is and that's that.

With OoT, while it would have been awesome if it had more difficult side content, as it is the whole game is an incredibly elegent total experience that MM simply cannot match in terms of immersion or intensity of joy."
67756,"It's hardly the same though, as you still have to run though everything in the temble in one go and do everything again if you fail. If you could reload the owl statue save as many times as you wanted, that would completely change the game in a positive way."
69095,"Yes. The time limit wouldn't be anywhere near as bad if the game didn't *force* you to repeat so much stuff to be even allowed to explore properly (and then most events only give you a window of a few minutes to figure out what you should be doing).

If the game let you go back and set the world into specific states, or even let you simply reload saves freely, the time limit would hardly be an issue to the same extent."

The thing is, I loved FFX's sidequests (which make what would have been the worst FF into the best), so the idea of a sequal which is entierly focused on that aspect of the game should have insane appeal to me. But the way it's actually done, with you having to do everything at a specific point and most of the quests being tasks that are handed to, really fails to capture the sense of true freedom that FFX gives you once you get the airship."
