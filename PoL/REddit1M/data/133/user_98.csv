41628,"The Owl Statues thing is pointed out in game.  The money thing should be figured out fairly easily if you're trying to explore the town.  The Inverse Song of Time/Song of Double Time were probably the least known, but the Scarecrow tells you when you talk to him in the Observatory, and since he's the only character on that floor and it's a small room, there should be no reason you don't talk to him.  If you couldn't figure these things out, maybe Zelda isn't your type of game.  Talking and exploring is a cornerstone of the series, especially Majora's Mask."
