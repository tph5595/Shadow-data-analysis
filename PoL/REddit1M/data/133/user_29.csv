I didn't like it because it is a collection game. I never get 100% in games. Never had the drive for it, and I don't really care to get it because it doesn't make a difference in the overall story. Even less when it required some odd leaps of logic to figure out.

So in my head, OoT will always be the superior of the two. Even if their are ways of making MM ""easier"" - or at least just ""easier"" to swallow."

Your complaints about others complaints are just as annoying. "

Get masks to learn about different fates. There's only 4 temples (it's been a while, so forgive me if there's more). So when in OoT you're spending all the time in temples, that's the game. In MM, it's more of just an excuse to use your masks. You could choose to get all the jars in OoT, but it having more than one isn't necessary. You could choose not to get most of the masks in MM, but then you've just missed 70% of the game or something.

Having to redo everything (say you need the ice temple melted to get a mask - all you have to do is tele to the boss and kill him, but what a pain) after a day reset is also not something I'm fond of. "
35531,"This. So much. It's a challenge in patience. Mess up one little thing in a chain and you have to do it all over again. About the time I made a mistake when trying to get the milk mask (or something?) and I had to go through saving the little girl from aliens again, I realized MM was not for me.

I did love the dark tones in the game, but I could never care enough after enough day restarts."
40148,"I think you hit the nail on the head on why I don't like it. =) I find those meaningful side quests annoying and tedious because they're interesting, but did not feel worth the effort. If I skip the happy mask quest in OoT, no difference in any character's story. If I skip a mask in MM, I'm missing out on a character's whole story.

I think Epona's story is about as big as a side quest gets in OoT, tbh. And I like it that way. And to each his own. I don't think I'll ever be able to enjoy playing through MM like someone else might because I don't enjoy the item hunt/side quest aspect that makes most of it. And I honestly envy people who do, because MM has such an interesting story. I just can't do it myself, lol."
70433,"I never said you couldn't complain (edit: about the game). I just said you complaining about other people complaining is just as annoying as what you say is annoying. ""Cry me a river"". "
