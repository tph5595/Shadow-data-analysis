It's not that there's a time limit: even to a 10 year old, it's not a huge constraint. 

No, the real issue is that it makes you redo things. A lot. No, not money, there's the bank. But I remember having to go back and beat bosses to change the environment to get some stuff: A lot of crap on snowpeak can only be done once you bring spring to the mountain. And unless you have a guide, you won't be doing it all at once. I think in my first playthrough (I got all the masks, which made 10 year old me feel awesome,) I detonated about 15 powder kegs because of all the crap at the ranch I kept forgetting to do.


That being said, the time mechanic in MM is nowhere near the levels of ""Wow, that's some pretty blatant padding"" that Wind Waker gets. I actually can enjoy playing MM before getting bored and quitting, and it has its awesome parts. I had to force myself to beat WW. I got the game on release, and I beat it in early 2007."

And I also think a Zora sells water bombs there too. And there are water bombs and water bomb fish all over the place in the actual temple. "
