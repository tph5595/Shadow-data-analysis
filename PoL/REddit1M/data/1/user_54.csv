26166,"Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, well, I probably won't be buying any more Nintendo consoles until after they've EOL'd."
26374,"It's not like they haven't done this before with a Legend of Zelda game either, but I fell for it again."
26578,"They pushed Twilight Princess back so they could have a big launch title for the Wii and that just pissed people off.  People are going to be more wary about buying Nintendo consoles in general once they realize that they could wait an entire generation for an announced game only to learn that yes, you'll get an inferior version, but it's coming out on the next system.

With Twilight Princess it wasn't so bad, because the Gamecube at least got *a* Zelda game with Wind Waker.  The WiiU has basically been a waste of a system, as far as Zelda games go.  All it's gotten has been remakes and a spinoff, and promises."
26808,"The console hasn't sold well because people have been waiting for big-name games which keep getting pushed back.  This is just another disappointment of Nintendo's long history of being unwilling to commit to systems, which creates a self-fulfilling prophecy where the system is seen as a failure and they push everything back to the next one.

Nobody buys Nintendo consoles for third party titles, but they've been really sparse with the first-party games the last two generations.  Apart from a spinoff, we haven't gotten a new Legend of Zelda console game since the end of the Gamecube era.

**Edit:** Apparently I forgot Skyward Sword, like the fool I truly am..."
26946,"To be fair, it's been two console generations since we've gotten a new console Zelda game, since Twilight Princess on the Wii was a Gamecube port.

**Edit:** Apparently I forgot Skyward Sword, like the fool I truly am..."
26981,You're lucky.  By the time the Wii was readily available I'd already given up on trying to get one.
27479,"Being on the NX gives incentive to buy the console, but that's countered by the knowledge that if history is any indication, there won't be much else noteworthy released for the system, because they keep pulling this nonsense."
27513,"And this is why it's such a poor choice on their part, trying to trick people into buying an NX by holding back something everyone's been excited about."
27614,"This is embarassing.  One of the reasons I was so happy my wife got me a WiiU was finally being able to play Skyward Sword (which I was really enjoying until I got distracted by some other games), and I went and completely forgot it.  Looks like it's ritual suicide for me..."
