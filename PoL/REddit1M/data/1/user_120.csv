50505,"I don't think they're incompetent with their franchises.  Zelda maintains a very high level of qualtiy, and I'm sure the new one will be great.  This is them being incompetent at selling consoles, which is not really new.  They had to drop their console WAAAY earlier than expected, which (if TP is any indication) led them to start a Zelda port mid-development, which slowed things down and resulted in multiple delays for the original version of the game.  

My gut tells me the game would probably already be out without the NX version.  "

Why should Zelda be different?  Zelda games are generally simpler than ES, but also *much* more polished.  And Nintendo can still pump out full handheld Zeldas at an impressive pace given their quality.

The quality of console Zelda titles is always contentious (see: the Zelda cycle), but I don't think SS was significantly worse than TP or TWW.   I guess that's up to preference, though."
