That turned out to be a waste of money.  Nintendo has taught me to not spend money on them until I'm certain, which sure as shit won't be at launch.  Even if the NX version of the game is the better version, at this point, I can't see myself spending another $400 that may just be wasted.  I'll play it on the WiiU, enjoy it, and then see how the NX fares for a few years first.  I'm so pissed at this."

22891,I'm not upset about them taking time to make it good.  I'm upset that I bought a WiiU for it and now it looks like I should have waited and not wasted the money on the WiiU.
