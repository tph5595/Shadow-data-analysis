13680,"Holy shit, I've never seen such a childish, entitled comment on here before... games get delayed all the time, live with it... not to mention the game is still coming..."
16049,"How have they failed to deliver though? The game is still releasing this gen. It is coming to the Wii U. People are acting like it's been delayed an entire year, but it's just a couple months. And games being pushed an entire generation isn't exactly unheard of either. Just look at Final Fantasy XV.

The thing that frustrates me, is that people act like making a game and predicting its eventual release is easy. People act like Nintendo could have already finished the game if they wanted to. But it's not that easy. We've seen what happens when companies focus more on release dates than the quality of the game and it's not pretty. People also seem to forget that Nintendo is a business, not a charity. They have no obligation to give us a certain amount of Zelda games on a certain platform within a certain time frame. 

Yeah, it's unfortunate that the Wii U is not going to have an exclusive Zelda game, but I feel like people focus more on that idea than what it actually means. The Wii U is still gonna get a brand new Zelda game, it's just going to release a few months later than we thought before. Unlike what OP said, you don't have to buy an entirely new console to play it and I think it's very premature to conclude that the Wii U version is going to be infinitely inferior to the NX version."
20132,"&gt; Nintendo are a business you're correct, so from a business point of view will it not make more sense for the flag ship game on your newest console to be infinitely better than a previous generation of consoles to not push sales on the NX? Otherwise what's the point in releasing it on the newer console if it's not different?

Because a lot of people who are interested in Zelda don't even own a Wii U in the first place. They're not going to look at it, think ""oh wow that looks so cool, I think I might spend the cash on this brand new system so I can play this game"", only to then look at the Wii U version and go ""oh but this version on this old, no longer supported console doesn't look much worse, so never mind."" Even if the Wii U is cheaper, I think people would still be inclined to go for the brand new system, especially if Nintendo focuses their advertising on that.

I mean, I think the NX version might look a bit better and run a bit smoother, but it all remains to be seen. I highly doubt it's going to be as drastic as OP suggests, in that the Wii U version would be so inferior, there's basically no point in getting it."
32485,"Advertising is pretty damn important though, you can't really ask companies to just forget about that. Also, what's your source for companies spending more on advertising than on game development?"
53784,"&gt;I think the opposite is the case, the only people who do have a Wii U are the people who buy consoles for Zelda, and other Nintendo games

Sure, but I still think there are many people who would be interested in the game, but haven't bought a Wii U for it yet. Just look at Twilight Princess, which sold far more on the Wii than on the Gamecube, even at launch. Now, with only little more than 10 million Wii U's out in the wild, I think there are plenty of non Wii U owners who would still be interested in getting the game.

&gt; And the response from Nintendo was to release a bunch of mediocre games all the while reminding the fanbase that ""yes, we know these games are underwhelming, but don't worry because Zelda is coming!"". But it never came, and now they're burning the fanbase who stuck with them by saying ""well you guys probably could have skipped this entire generation if all you wanted was Zelda"". And it's leaving many people, myself included, wondering why buy this console at all if the one solid game for it is the game we've been waiting for 4 years and runs on last generation hardware?

Right, because all other Wii U games are not worth playing... 

And like I said before, if all you wanted was Zelda, then maybe you shouldn't have bought a Wii U yet. If you still did anyways, you have only yourself to blame."
58598,"Uuuuh, most of those games were great? Smash, Mario Kart and Splatoon are fantastic, I haven't played Mario 3D World myself, but I have hear a lot of good stuff about and there are a lot of other Wii U games that have been reviewed very positively. It's funny that you just ignore all these opinions and act as if these games are objectively mediocre and then say that I'm the one on the high horse.

It's also silly to pretend like Nintendo purposefully lied when they announced Zelda for 2015, as if they were already planning all of this back then, instead of just a simple change of plans. But if you honestly believe all of this shit, I don't think there's any sense to be talked into you."
