13090,"I got a Wii U on launch day after seeing the potential with [the Zelda tech demo back in 2012](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_fyOkrteqM). So we're looking at five years in between the tech demo and the new Zelda launch (yes I know the tech demo was just that and wasn't proof of a real zelda being worked on, but still, the hype it brought was real)"
