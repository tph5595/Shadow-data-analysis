Seriously. If you're waiting for the Wii U version, the only thing that has changed is another delay. Yeah, that sucks, but the level of salt I'm seeing would only be justified if the game was going to be an NX exclusive. 

I bought a Wii U for this game too, and I'm upset about the delays, but I'm not going full soap opera and declaring to Nintendo that they've lost a customer. I'd prefer a 2016 holiday release, but I can live with playing the Wii U version at a later date because I've got bigger things to worry about in my life than getting a fucking video game exactly when I want it.
