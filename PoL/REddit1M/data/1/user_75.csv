30158,"Let's consider the release schedule of the *major* Zelda games recently:

Skyward Sword: Holiday 2011

Twilight Princess:  Holiday 2006

Wind Waker:  Holiday 2002

OoT: Holiday 1998

So we're looking at a release schedule of 4-5 years.  Consider the problems Nintendo has been having recently and the serious need for them to get off of the Wii-U and onto the NX.  With the next major entry for an IP that can be a console pusher does it make sense for them to release it at the end of a current/previous generation console's lifecycle?  Sure it means pushing into the 6th year since skyward sword...but with all of the re-masters and couple 3DS games it's not like we've been without all this time. 

From a business standpoint this sounds like a slam dunk.  It'll push the sales of NX for folks that can buy one.  And for those that have to settle with the Wii-U version they will also have the opportunity to play it.  "

Engine, characters and art, and even level design.  As far as development cycles go it was developed similarly to expansion packs nowadays.  "

I hate it when reddit gets nitpicky but I suppose if I'd have put ""not like we've been without *fresh* Zelda titles all this time"" that would have been more clear.  

Compared to other AAA Nintendo IPs...like the Metroid series... we've had a flood of Zelda games released over the past few years.  "
