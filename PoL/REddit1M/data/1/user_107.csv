44297,"Yeah, this Zelda has been in development for several years now, we've seen footage of it, hell it's likely in a finished state right now, they're just holding it back to bump up the resolution (*maybe*) and the textures. This isn't ""next-gen"" Zelda, this is what should have come out a year ago. Don't expect it to look like the Witcher."
45009,"&gt;Because a lot of people who are interested in Zelda don't even own a Wii U in the first place.

I think the opposite is the case, the only people who do have a Wii U are the people who buy consoles for Zelda, and other Nintendo games. I think that's the shortcoming that Nintendo is having with the Wii U, only the people who are longtime, dedicated fans bought it. And the response from Nintendo was to release a bunch of mediocre games all the while reminding the fanbase that ""yes, we know these games are underwhelming, but don't worry because Zelda is coming!"". But it never came, and now they're burning the fanbase who stuck with them by saying ""well you guys probably could have skipped this entire generation if all you wanted was Zelda"". And it's leaving many people, myself included, wondering why buy this console at all if the one solid game for it is the game we've been waiting for 4 years and runs on last generation hardware?"
47280,"Why, so we can have some stupid over inflated voice acting like a children's cartoon? Remember, a Zelda game will be pretty heavily marketed as an ""everyone"" game, meaning that it will be child friendly, so don't expect gritty/dark/adult voices. Imagine a whole cast of characters who talk like the clowns from TP."
47483,"Really? I've felt that recent Zelda games are increasingly ""empty"". TP sticks out like a sore thumb for me, I can't remember any details from the field portion because it was so bland. They created a huge world and populated it with some boring obstacles. Exploration in MM was on another level though, something that they should be striving for."
53385,"I'll upvote you back to 1, not because I agree with your opinion, but because we're having a good discussion.

Your statement about Skyrim honestly comes off as though you haven't played the game. Yeah, Skyrim has it's flaws, and yes one of those flaws was repeatedly using a similar style of dungeon, but to think there wasn't variety in Skyrim, perhaps as much as a Zelda game, is flat out wrong. There was a wealth of puzzles to do to find exclusive weapons and armour, there was a variety of towns to go to and visit, there were multiple of mountains to climb, there were guilds to join, there was a level that was a house party that you could attend and sneak around in, there was even a huge ship to explore and find and kill an emperor on!

Now, one thing that Zelda does get very right is level design. You're right, doing things like trekking to an abandoned mansion in a blizzard, or going inside a giant cistern is a lot of fun, and the atmosphere in those levels are great, but theres one key difference between exploring in Zelda and exploring in Elder Scrolls: Linearity.

In the Elder Scrolls games, I'm exploring because there's just so much to see and do, in Zelda it's because the guy told me to after the last level. There's never anything to do but play the story in Zelda, where as the story usually blows in Elder Scrolls so I end up doing a multitude of exploring different areas. The amount of content in an Elder Scrolls game is overwhelming, to the point that I've put something like 3-400 hours into Skyrim, even if a lot of the time it's just ""go here, get this"" there's just a wealth of things to do. In Zelda, it's just story, increasingly sidequests have just been ignored. It's become ""do this flying challenge and get heart piece"" or ""talk to this person 3 times and get heart piece"" or even the dreaded ""collect a lot of this thing and get heart piece"". 

You can criticize Bethesda for their lack of originality in their newer games, but Nintendo is literally doing the exact same thing. I shuttered when I met the bat guy in SS and he told me I had to collect some useless junk.

In the end, you can't have a clean comparison between the two games, it's like apples to oranges. One is very story driven, the other is more of a sandbox. But having played games like Skyrim and the Witcher series, I can't help but feel that Zelda is stuck in this one regard. The whole world feels so sterile in comparison to newer games. "
56044,"&gt; Right, because all other Wii U games are not worth playing...
And like I said before, if all you wanted was Zelda, then maybe you shouldn't have bought a Wii U yet. If you still did anyways, you have only yourself to blame.

No, I bought a Wii U to play Mario, Mario Kart, Paper Mario, Donkey Kong, Star Fox, Metroid, Yoshi, Zelda, Smash Bros, etc. Point me to one game from Nintendo's flagship series that has been better than mediocre on Wii U. The games from their main series, the ones people buy Nintendo consoles for have been, at best, alright, or at worst, non-existent. This is Nintendo we are talking about. I bought a Wii U banking on them to put effort into their own ip's, and they burned me, no proper Mario, no proper Zelda, no proper Metroid, those are the reason I bought the system, and therefore I won't be trusting them in the future. 

Meanwhile you are on your high horse telling them that we can't criticize the company that left us hanging, well too bad, I'm going to vocally criticize them because they screwed me. I don't ""have myself to blame"" for expecting quality from them.

We are going to criticize them for releasing a last gen game as the flagship for their new console - don't fool yourself, Zelda U is a last gen game, developed for the Wii U, just as Twilight Princess was a gamecube game. We are going to criticize them for tantalizing us by showing us footage of a Zelda game, saying firmly that it was going to be released in 2015. Consumers don't like being lied to."
57099,"Uhh, the GPU in the NX isn't going to be capable of any kind of quality AA, not at the $400 price point. You'd need a $400 GPU alone to be able to get good AA at 1080p, 60fps. If there's any graphical adjustments, it's going to be like the difference between an r7 370 card and an R9 380 card, at best."
58718,"It wasn't, but if they expect people to pay more than $400 for a console with no games they're dreaming."
60678,"I didn't downvote you, someone else did, I was just bringing you back to 1. 

My whole point was that both are slipping in terms of quality, both are developing a shallowness, but both also excel in different areas. I want them to build off of each other, I want something else to find and earn in Zelda other than another piece of heart that will make my already too long life bar even longer. I want Skyrim to have compelling stories, and interesting, lifelike characters. I want Zelda to have sprawling landscapes, scaleable mountains, little secrets to find like a house in the middle of nowhere with little bits of lore you can read to add some backstory to the world. 

Yes, Skyrim did have a lot of forgettable underworld bits, but I do remember going into Sheogorath's Realm, I do remember spelunking countless caves while J'zargo kept exclaiming that he had my back, I do remember a mission where I got blackout drunk and married some creature. All of those were a lot more memorable than what I can say about the overworld for almost any Zelda game.

All this to say, different strokes for different folks. If you want Zelda to stay the way it is, then that's your prerogative, but I feel that many of us would rather that the series evolve and implement some of the things that modern games are doing successfully. "
