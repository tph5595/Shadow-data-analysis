In order to fill the game roster, they need to have a powerhouse of system, with AAA titles on lauch from developers like Squarenix, Bethesda, Rockstar, and From Software, in addition to a rock solid library of in house masterpieces. In addition, Nintendo needs to get over it's phobia of third party M rated games, as those are the ones that generally sell the best to a wide market. Bayonetta 2 was the right step, but eeds to be the norm in the big N's policy, not an exception.

That is how the NX will be successful. If Nintendo attempts a repeat of the Wii U's launch, they simply won't be able to remain competitive in the system game."
