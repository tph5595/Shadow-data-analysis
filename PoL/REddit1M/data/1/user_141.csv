131989,"Idk, on one hand I get why Wii U adopters are upset as this game was supposed to really encapsulate what was possible on that system (I guess now that title goes to Mario Maker?) and now it feels like the satisfaction of Wii U owners is a secondary priority behind the success of the NX launch. For me in particular it sucks to think that there will never be a purely Wii U, as every other Nintendo console generation had at least one Zelda title that truly capitalized on what that console was capable of.   HOWEVER, as disappointing as that is, I would rather Nintendo choose to double-down on a new console sooner than later, and for that console to be revolutionary enough and appealing to enough gamers that it allows Nintendo to be a driving force in the gaming industry again. And what better to launch this bold new era with than a flagship Zelda title. its not a perfect situation, but if in 5 years we look back on the NX-New Zelda pairing as the moment that Nintendo really got back on track then I think we will all be able to call it worth it, and to look back on the Wii U as a fun, if underwhelming diversion."
