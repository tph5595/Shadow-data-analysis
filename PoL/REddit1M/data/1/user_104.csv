41749,"I'm not surprised by the dual release. The Wii U has underperformed and what better launch title for a new console than a brand new 3D Zelda? 

What I am surprised by is the release date. I have to say that I am incredibly disappointed and a little pissed off. They've been talking about this game since 2011. From the time we got the first official trailer of the game to the time that the game might actually release, it could be *3 years.* If you count the tech demo that's 5 years. I think that's ridiculous. If you're going to take your time with a game to make it better, by all means, do so. But don't release trailers and gameplay demos and hype up the game if you don't plan on releasing it any time soon. It's not fair to fans. What also was unfair was Nintendo *confirming* a 2016 release. Pushing it back another year is a huge slap in the face to everyone they promised that the game would come out this year. The most annoying thing about the delay is that now we know it wasn't even for improvements to the game, it was very likely just to work on porting and compatibility with the NX, which ultimately probably won't be noticeably different from the Wii U version anyway, aside from maybe clearer graphics. So we have to wait another whole year to receive the game that was promised to us on the Wii U, just so they can perfect it for the NX. This pisses me off."
