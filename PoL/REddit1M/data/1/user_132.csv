72872,"I almost did the same exact thing. *almost*. I had no real source of income when the KH3 rumor mill started churning, but with the Wii U.. I finally caved. And Zelda Wii U on the horizon was a HUGE reason why I was able to. I know I shouldn't feel betrayed, they're a company. But god I am frustrated "
73438,"okay, listen. I'm. very VERY patient with Nintendo. I own all but two of their home consoles. Their IPs are my favorite in the world. Hell I’m getting a Pokemon tattoo next month, which wouldn’t be what it would be without Nintendo. I’ll defend them til the day I die.

And I get it. Shit happens. And I'm willing to wait for quality. But when a game temporarily titled Zelda WII U was revealed over TWO YEARS AGO... I kind of expect it to be on the Wii U. Yknow, the game touted to mesh so perfectly with the Wii U controls? Map on screen? “look at how this game looks on our shiny new console!” That reveal was one of the huge reasons I caved and ended up getting a Wii U in the first place - it was a lot of people’s reasons. And although I don't regret that decision, I can't help but be frustrated. I’m.. I’m disappointed even. I want to believe in my favorite console creator but... I'm growing impatient. When your blind fanboys start to get tired of mistakes, you know something is going wrong..."
