2160,"Man, I'm getting pretty good at predicting what Nintendo is going to do, even though this was a little obvious.  In this case though, I sort of wish I was wrong.

For what it's worth:  With a 2016 release date, we could assume reasonably that it would have been *late* 2016 (3D Zelda games usually come out in November), so this delay is only a few months rather than a year like it seems."
6005,"You are right to be upset.  This *is* Nintendo's poor planning and you've got every right to criticize them for it.

But you should sit back for a second and consider a few things.  Primarily, the fact that you're disappointed with the Wii U, and why you are.

The Wii U flopped for a number of reasons.  The biggest was its piss-poor launch, and another its utter lack of any support for third parties, accompanied by its outdated hardware.

Because of those things, you're left unsatisfied with the console, but there is a good reason why this is happening to Zelda U now: to help prevent what you feel about the Wii U from happening again.

They could release the game solely on Wii U, sure, but that wouldn't really change much and it wouldn't help their future at all.  It'd be one little shining bonus at the end of a sea of flop.

This way, though, a new Zelda game pushing the launch of a new console can go a *long* way towards preventing what was so bad about the Wii U.  Right there, worries of a poor launch (that killed the Wii U) are hugely nullified, and with a good launch comes way more support and in-turn way more games.  This scenario is *much* more likely to turn out in a positive way than any chance the Wii U ever had.

You can consider that - maybe - with this new console, they have the potential to start doing things that *don't* piss us off.  It just sucks that it took them this long, and this many poor decisions to finally get to this potential.

I've been a Nintendo supporter for about 30 years too, so I understand you, but this is the first time I've felt hopeful for Nintendo's future in more than 10 years.  It's just seriously annoying that it had to come in *this* form."
6909,"No, it doesn't.  Like I said, you're right to criticize them.  I've been doing that for like 15 years now.

But now I feel like there's potential that I might be able to finally stop doing that.  Of course the NX might come with a thousand more stupid decisions that Nintendo is so fond of, but this already has more potential than anything they've done in the past 15 years.

A next-gen Zelda, on a next-gen console?  That hasn't happened since Wind Waker and it being a launch title brings *huge* potential for a good launch, good sales, and good support for the console and anyone who owns it.  Basically, the antithesis of the Wii U's situation.  Let's hope they don't screw up such a huge potential."
7747,"Haha I'm still skeptical too.  I'm not even sure the game itself won't disappoint me, but I've got reasonable hope.  It - by itself - is one of the most ambitious things Nintendo has attempted in ages, regardless of the NX.

And you're right not to preorder anything.  I've never preordered anything and I can think of countless situations where that was a good choice.

We'll see how it goes.  New president, new console, new Zelda.  Let's hope these things all fall into place, and if they do what seems like a really annoying situation might be the turning point that takes Nintendo back to a place like where they used to be.

But of course, we won't know until *another year* from now... and that part is annoying no matter how you slice it.  Let's hope it ends up being worth it, and that this year is forgotten in the potential change to come."
42970,"The business world is not relatable to domestic abuse, but I can see where you're coming from."
43168,"You are absolutely right.  The Wii U's name is a *huge* contributing factor to why it flopped.  Just a few days ago in another gaming sub, I explained to someone that the Wii U is an *actual* console, and they (along with many others) had absolutely no idea and were baffled that it wasn't just an add-on for the Wii."
43713,"Sorry, I wasn't clear.

It's a 'next-gen' Zelda in the way that we've never had a Zelda game with this generation's tech behind it.  The most recent 3D Zelda, Skyward Sword, still used almost the exact same tech that Gamecube did, which has been the case for all 3D Zelda games since 2002.

This one stops that, and if it takes advantage of the NX rather than just being a nearly identical port like Twilight Princess, it will be *basically* a next-gen Zelda game.  If it releases to a next-gen console and makes use of things that only that generation can, most would consider it a next-gen Zelda.

That *is* an 'if', though."
44138,"Thanks for being so reasonable!  I understand and share your feelings, I just hate to see people be so negative and down about Zelda, even if it is for good reason.  Despite Nintendo's poor decisions lately, getting a new Zelda game on a new Nintendo console is something with big potential, and something to be hopeful about in the long run."
46074,"&gt;Zelda U will be a current gen Zelda on a next gen console, just like they did with TP.

But I already explained that it could be at least *partially* next gen, if it takes advantage of what the NX can do.  *If* that version is doing things that can only be supported on the NX, whether it's graphics or physics, amount of actors/elements rendered, or something to do with the controls it will still have next-gen elements meaning that the game itself might be made up of things that you couldn't get with the previous gen.

Like I said though, that's an *if*.  It could be the exact same deal as Twilight Princess, and in that case, no I wouldn't consider it to be next-gen.

&gt;What this tells us though is that NX will likely have Gamepad support. 

Possibly.  Their consoles tend to have backwards compatible controls in certain instances, but we haven't seen anything about Zelda U that really screams the fact that it *needs* a gamepad.  So far, all we've seen are things done in WWHD and TPHD, which are optional.

&gt;You wouldn't consider Mario Kart 8 a next gen game

If they were to release it with lots of updates that are only possible on the NX, I would to some degree."
47338,"&gt;TP on the Wii did do things the Gamecube version couldn't do like widescreen and motion controls. We still don't consider the Wii version of TP a next gen game. 

A few things yeah, but they were minute and the game's actual appearance and general functions - which is what masses look at - didn't change at all.

&gt;A few improvements on the next system would not make it a next gen game. A complete NX remaster would make it a next gen game but that won't happen with Zelda U just like it didn't happen with TP Wii. 

It just depends on the improvements.  For example, GTAV was considered to have 'current gen' and 'next gen' versions based on the improvements made to it for PS4/Xbone/PC.

Your idea is that the thing that defines the 'gen' of a game is when it was built, which makes sense, but my definition is based on what the game can do.  If it can do things that are only found in the 'next gen', then I consider it to be at least partially next gen, depending on what it does.  In the end it's just semantics between us.

As for whether or not they're going to do anything fancy with the NX version, there's a topic discussing it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/4gq0lp/discussion_zelda_u_vs_zelda_nx/).  We can't claim to know what they're going to do one way or the other, but there are good points supporting both sides."
47748,"You could be right, no doubt, but there are no certainties yet.  Nintendo is going to want to push NX sales, and any bonus that might make someone buy an NX is a considerable factor."
49265,"&gt;...and that's all you should expect from the NX port. 

That's an assumption.  It might be right, but I'm not here to act like my assumptions are already facts set in stone.  If you'd like to suggest why you think yours are, please take it to that topic I suggested earlier.  I'm only here to debate *possibilities*.

&gt;Why are you assuming the improvements will be massive? That isn't how Nintendo did it with TP Wii.

'It was this way before' does not dictate that it will be that way every time. The improvements to GTAV weren't 'massive' either, they were just nice tweaks here and there to bring the game over between gens.  I'm not assuming they will be 'massive', I'm playing at the possibility that they'll be enough for the game to be comparable to anything else in the future gen.

&gt;No, generations are not defined by the power of a console but rather by it's release date.

If it's defined strictly by release date and nothing else, Zelda releasing on NX in 2017... makes it next-gen.  If it has nothing to do with the hardware and capabilities, how exactly is it current gen when it won't be out until the next gen comes?  You say the hardware is irrelevant, but at the same time you say the hardware's date is the only thing it depends on.

&gt;Likewise, Ocarina of Time on the Gamecube is a port of an N64 game, they made some minor graphical changes and that's all. 

OoT on Gamecube didn't change anything about the graphics except the color of the buttons.  It was a collectors edition of old emulated games."
52417,"&gt;I am not going to another thread to discuss something you brought up here.

What I brought up here just pertains to what we define as next gen.  What I referred you to that topic for is to find points pertaining to whether or not they will change anything between versions, nothing to do with whether or not it should be called next-gen.

&gt;I disagree on the basis that Nintendo didn't make massive changes last time they ported a dual release Zelda game.

Like I said, you could be right, but a past example *does not* dictate any future instance.

&gt;remaster it for the NX for a duel release

Your use of 'remaster' leads me to believe that you might not be well caught up on how easy it is nowadays to quickly increase the graphical quality of any given modern project, granted the hardware allows it.  If you *are*, I apologize for the misunderstanding, but let me explain just in case:

One example of a graphical element that many people dislike is aliasing, or 'jaggies'.  The way every model has a 'staircase' effect against the background.  The reason this persists is because antialiasing sucks up a lot of GPU power, but *if* you have the extra power you can turn AA on with literally the flick of a switch.  The same goes for most graphical effects, like shadows or lighting.  Even textures are made in high-resolution, then downscaled to suit the hardware.  To replace all textures with their higher resolution source is not a big task.

&gt;it would be a next gen game but given how slow NIntendo has become, a remastered version wouldn't be out until 2020.

You're confusing remastering an old game with turning up the settings on a current game.  These things are *leagues* away from eachother in workload.

For them to make WWHD, for example, they had to:

1.  Port a *15* year old game to work on modern hardware.
2.  Rework that game so that it can support modern techniques, after it had be designed to only use techniques found 15 years ago.
3.  Rewrite the entire lighting engine, along with various other things that needed re-built as they were far too dated to function in any acceptable modern standard.

Now, for Zelda U to look vastly superior, they *do not* need to rewrite or rebuild anything.  They don't need to take decade old code and rig it around to support modern techniques.  All they have to do enable higher quality settings, and test the game to make sure it runs smoothly with those settings in place.

It's not the same as rewriting an entire game to make it fit modern standards.  Zelda U already has these techniques in place, nothing has to be reworked or rewritten, they just need to be *tweaked* to make use of the extra power (if it has extra power).

I understand why you might look at the remaster of an old game and think that's how long it takes to change something, but it *only* takes that long because of how old the game is.  A modern game's techniques and assets are *much* more malleable than trying to force something old to look good again.  I believe this is where our difference on the chance of this to happen is coming from.

The reason Twilight Princess didn't look any different is because the Wii was barely any different from a Gamecube in hardware power.  That *could* be the case with the Wii U to NX, sure, but it doesn't *have* to be and I personally feel like that would be a massive mistake.  Rumors, for what they're worth, are saying that it will be more powerful than PS4, but rumors are rumors."
53073,"You are indeed right, I'm just hoping that this might change now that there's a plausible reason *for* it to change.  Their current tactics simply are not working, and most of those tactics are what Iwata put in place.  I hope their new president has a more business-minded approach."
53454,"PC game settings are one thing, but the settings inside a developer's engine and kit are a whole other story.  There's a cap (in-game, anyway) on PC game settings, but not for the dev. If the NX is capable, they could *easily* crank up the graphics to meet any next-gen standard.

I'm done with the next-gen argument, I guess.  Let me take back that phrasing and just say it would not be impossible or very difficult for them to crank up the settings to at least make it *comparable* to 'true' next-gen games.  You can trust me there, I've been practicing and studying this sort of thing for the past two decades."
57697,"Where the price stated?  I wasn't aware there was an actual info on it.

And AA was just an example because it's something most people understand or notice.  Console games will probably never have decent AA because all of the GPU's power is going to be used elsewhere, in more *necessary* places.  The only times you'll ever really see it is when they're just *looking* for ways to make use of any extra juice."
