34501,"Correct. And also, I'd argue most people are forgetting the **single most important reason the WiiU was a giant commercial failure**, which is the fucking NAME and marketing. 

I cannot tell you how many times I've had to struggle to explain to people that this shit is a new console and miles ahead of the fucking wii in power (the WiiU is weak compared to the PS4, but it's damn strong compared to the shitty Wii). 

The Wii had commercial success for wide appeal and pissed off the hardcore fanbase for being weak and equal in power to the GameCube. To me, the WiiU failed commercially because of the name and marketing first. The ""third party support"" and all that other shit is secondary, in my opinion. Personally, I don't even care to play all that other stuff on a Nintendo console, I know I can play that stuff at a higher level elsewhere and Nintendo shows no signs of catching up.
