28441,Unfortunately it sounds like the system is going to have the same problems as the Wii U. I think the Wii U is a decent system and have had a lot of fun on it with all their recent titles but it took so long for them to get a decent list of games to play. My SO and I would play through and get bored of every game and then have to wait before the next one came out. I really really don't want that to happen with the NX.
29138,Thank you for being so positive about all this. Every where I turn there are hopeless comments about how crappy this situation is and since I don't disagree it is hard to stay positive. But I do hold out hope that all this crap will result in a great turn around for Nintendo. Thanks for putting all my hopeful feelings into words and helping me hold out for change.
37735,IMO that's completely true. I actually get more use out of the Wii U than the xbox because the Wii U has freaking multiplayer support. That seems to be the only way my SO and I can play together anymore since 343 decided splitscreen was a no go for Halo 5 &gt;=/
115909,Agreed. If they do all that but still manage to have games that people can play together in the same room that will put them miles ahead of playstation and xbox in my book. I'm not sure why game creators decided people don't want to game together unless it's online but it is really what is keeping me firm with Nintendo despite all the mistakes they've made.
