37955,"This is what REALLY pisses me off. If it were really a delay to purely improve the game, that'd be one thing. It's as you say, it's quite unlikely this delay is centered around improving the game. Surely they'll do at least a few design improvements over the course of the year or some such, but it's mostly because of the NX port.

 And that's what really gets me: This game being ported at all. If this game is coming out on the SAME EXACT day on both consoles, I'd rather them have just not done a Wii U version at all and give a true next gen zelda at launch. Instead, the NX version is going to be gimped because it's a port of a game using console tech almost a fucking decade old. It'll look better than the wii u version I hope, but if it were designed for the NX ground-up? Yeah.... so now Wii U owners are getting shafted because they don't get their exclusive Zelda that many people bought the system for, and the NX version is going to be a souped up port instead of a true next-gen game. 
This is just shitty all-around."
