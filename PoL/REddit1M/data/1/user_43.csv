23469,"Well, as someone who never got a Wii U, my last reason to get one just went away.  I had somewhat considered it, but I kept looking and only seeing a very few games that actually interested me and kept thinking maybe when the new Zelda comes out I will finally get it.  Now knowing this this I am just going to skip it altogether and get an NX instead, and I am quite frankly actually glad I never bought a Wii U.  I feel bad for those who do have a Wii U though, seems like they really got gipped."
