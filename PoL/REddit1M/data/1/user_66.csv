27603,"Current rumors about the NX seem to suggest that it will be more powerful than the Wii U.  That is, in contrast to the gamecube and wii, which the same CPU and GPU hardware.  If the NX is a more powerful system than the Wii U then it is reasonable to assume the game may run at higher resolutions or frame rates than the Wii U version.  

Of course, this is all rumors.  What if the NX is similarly powered to the Wii U, but is some kindof portable/console hybrid?"
