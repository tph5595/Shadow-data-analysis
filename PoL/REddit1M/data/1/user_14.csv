I saw this shit coming a mile away. There was no way they were not going to release this new Zelda to boost their new console so close to release. I honestly don't care, because I didn't buy a Wii U from the start."

The Wii U was just a bad idea. The controller sucked and it was just a rehash of the Wii. I was sick and tired of motion controls and other gimmicks and just wanted a proper console to play my Nintendo games. 

And since I became more of a single player gamer I only would have considered buying a Wii U if a good Zelda game would be on it. Though Skyward Sword mas a major disappointment, the new Zelda was looking to be something interesting and different for once."
