4983,"It's time to vent.

We are about to finish an entire gaming console life cycle for Nintendo.
In this life cycle, we've had just about every 3d Zelda game ""remade"" or ""remastered"" with promises that all of the work done in the remakes were experimentation for the WII U Zelda Title.

Now that that's all out of the way, Nintendo pulls this baby back fucking horse shit. It is a god damn disgrace to hold off Zelda U and decide to make it a launch title with their next home console coming out NEXT FUCKING YEAR.

Nintendo has been promising for years, FOR FUCKING YEARS, that Zelda U is coming. They've teased with with images, a trailer, and slight gameplay.

They talk about things they've changed in remakes and about how they want to change the Zelda Formula. All in the hopes of making Zelda U the best Zelda ever.

A large percentage of Wii U adopters adopted the system with the promise of Zelda U. And every year Nintendo has done something for Zelda to keep it relevant, still promising that our game was coming. Telling us that our 300 dollar investment would be worth it.

Sure there have been other pretty good games for the system. Mario Kart, Mario Maker, Splatoon, Xenoblade, Starfox, etc. But it never had a true killer ap.

Why is this? It's because Nintendo kept promising us Zelda U.

""Oh it's coming, we promise, you'll see. Zelda U will be amazing. In the mean time, please buy this mediocre Star Fox game again, please""

All I wanted was to get my hands on this game that we've been promised for about 5 years now.

And now I'm not getting it.

Nintendo is delaying Zelda until 2017, even though we were promised, again, that it would be ready for holiday 2016.

Not only is it being delayed a mother fucking gain, it's now going to be a launch title on Nintendo's next console, the NX.

We're about to go through an entire console cycle for Nintendo, and they're not going to release a single New and Original Zelda game? They haven't released a true Mario game either, but that's another rant in itself almost.

If I want to play the next iteration of Zelda, I'm going to have to shovel out another 3-400 dollars to get the system that will play the game, plus the cost of the game itself.

My Fucking Wii U has been nothing but a Paper weight for 4 years now. I think I own like 3 games because anything I've tried has been mostly mediocre, and there just aren't many games made for the system.

I primarily use my Wii U as a fucking Netflix box. A 300 dollar Netflix box.

YOU CAN BUY A FUCKING GOOGLE CHROME FOR 30 DOLLARS AND GET NETFLIX.

Nintendo really fucked up. They fucked up bad.

""But Lftenjamin,"" you'll say, ""They're releasing Zelda U for NX and Wii U""

Bull shit. You know damn well the definitive version of the game will be the NX version. It will have the upscaled graphics, better resolution, patch support, potential DLC, it will all come for the NX.

The Wii U version will be an inferior product. A waste of time.

I'm so livid right now. I don't know if anyone is actually gonna read all of this, and if you did, I'm sorry I wasted your time.

I've been a Nintendo supporter for all of my almost 25 years of existence, and I feel duped. I've been string along for 5 years, told to buy this 300 dollar netflix box, and now you're not going to give me what I was promised?

I better shut up now, I could probably type forever."
6322,"I'm starting to calm down. I just had to vent out my frustrations the moment I read the news.

I'm still livid as fuck about the situation.

Maybe NX will be the next great thing, I dunno. But it still doesn't make it right that Nintendo promised me a product, so I gave them 300 dollars for a Wii U, and now I'm not getting that product."
7093,"damn dude, you could talk someone out of jumping off a bridge with that kind of logic.

I'm still skeptical as all hell, but maybe I'll give Nintendo half a shot.

I won't preorder anything or make a commitment. I'll wait to see how inital sales and reviews shake out and make a decision then."
27586,"There were other games I wanted to play.

I had fun with some of the other games I've played on the system, but I was still promised Zelda the whole time. 

The games I had fun with were just that. They were fun, but not much else. I didn't have a true amazing experience. I was hoping Zelda would be that."
27834,"[They can't keep getting away with it, and expect me to jsut give them my money.](https://youtu.be/1YVrxFmheSc)"
27883,It's all good. Nintendo mostly forgot about Skyward Sword too.
28158,"I had fun with other games I played for the system.

But nothing worth the time that a Zelda game would have given. 

The other big Wii U games have mostly let me down. My favorite game on the console is Mario Kart. That's the only game I still play.
That and Smash brothers, but I really only play smash brothers when some of my friends ask me to play with them.

It's almost horrible that the best game on the system is a simple (again, still pretty good) kart racer.
