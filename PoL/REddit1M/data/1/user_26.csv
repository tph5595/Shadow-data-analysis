14501,"I don't think OP's comment is about the game being delayed for X amount of years, it's more that Nintendo has been promising the next original Zelda game for a long time and have failed to deliver. 

The teaser for Zelda Wii U was released back in 2014, how you can release a teaser trailer for a game and for that game to not get released in the game consoles life span is pretty awful if you ask me.

I'm glad they are delaying it to make it the Zelda game we deserve. But imho OP's rant is justified. "
18284,"When a company sets a date and fails to meet that date, they're failing to deliver am I right? 

I agree that Nintendo should definitely push back the release date to make the game better. 

Nintendo are a business you're correct, so from a business point of view will it not make more sense for the flag ship game on your newest console to be infinitely better than a previous generation of consoles to not push sales on the NX? Otherwise what's the point in releasing it on the newer console if it's not different? 

You bring up some valid points but I believe OP is justified in his comments. "
