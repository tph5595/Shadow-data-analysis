I didn't want to wait any longer for the game, and I bought into the Wii hype, so I sucked it up and spent a lot of cash. I don't think I need to recount how shitty that console was."

23032,"&gt; If it was released early on the wiiu there would be no reason to get the nx until the next AAA

Which ought to give Nintendo fans pause about whether the NX will have a good launch lineup at all. I hear some people say it's a good move because it ensures the system has a good launch. I say it's a troubling one for consumers, because it's a crutch that artificially gives the appearance of a good launch. It's not all that different from Wind Waker HD being produced in order to sell WiiU's because they didn't have any other noteworthy titles at the start. 

This move lowers my confidence even further."

It may be a fictional world, but it draws inspiration from common Medieval influences and Earth-like biodomes that we can relate to. It's supposedly (if you believe in the timeline shit) the same Hyrule as the one in Ocarina of Time, and the geography while nearly identical in the proper GC version, is mirrored and wrong on the Wii version, even if you try to wave away the Sun movement shit.


Come on, that's such a lame defense. If gravity suddenly stops existing in Game of Thrones and 2+2 now = 5, is that totally fine because ""lol it's a fantasy story""? I will admit that it would be a more understandable argument if the Wii version was the definitive and only version of the game. Then you could say it was what the creators intended - but it wasn't. What they intended us to see is the GameCube version, just like a filmmaker intends his audience to view his film in its original widescreen format, not cropped for 4:3 television as was commonly done.

Flipping Twilight Princess wasn't an artistic choice, it was a technical one because more gamers are right handed and they were rushing to have the game playable for the Wii's launch to boost sales. I happen to disagree with that choice."
