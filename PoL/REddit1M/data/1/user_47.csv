24071,It's a fantasy game...why would the sun moving in a different direction destroy immersion for you?
478561,"The sun moving west to east is not the equivalent of gravity suddenly disappearing or 2+2=5. That's just silly. 

The only argument you make that makes sense is that it is inconsistent with what was shown in other Zelda games. But if that's all it takes to completely kill immersion for you,  with all the other inconsistencies in the series I don't know how you can enjoy it at all. "
