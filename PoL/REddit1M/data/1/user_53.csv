26010,"Buying a whole console for one game is ridiculous anyway, ESPECIALLY a game that's going to simultaneously release on a system you presumably already own.If this is anything like TP, the only difference between versions will be the controller. The gamepad is an excellent Zelda controller.There's absolutely no reason why anyone would get an NX just for the new Zelda if they already have a Wii U.I'll get an NX based on the launch lineup, with Zelda unincluded in my decision."
26931,"I guess their reasoning is that the game will be new and exciting when it releases and might compel people who skipped the Wii U to buy an NX.

If they know what they're doing, their target audience this time won't be people who have a Wii U (because they'll most likely get an NX anyway assuming it isn't awful), but people who don't have a Wii U - the people they've previously failed to reach.

Is it justified? No. Is it a good business decision? Probably.

Point being, I don't think they're trying to pressure Wii U owning Zelda fans to buy an NX. I think they're trying to pressure non-Wii U owning Zelda fans to buy an NX. Those of us with a Wii U already are just collateral. "
29878,"Agreed. They're sacrificing good PR for more sales. Probably the right decision, but it's an ugly look."
