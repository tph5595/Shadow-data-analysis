5091,Glad that it's still coming out for Wii U but if the NX version proves to be superior I see myself buying an NX when it releases. I suppose the best case scenario is that the NX has backwards compatibility so people who bought a Wii U with Zelda U in mind can maybe sell them and upgrade. Shame it has been delayed again but I'm sure it will be worth it!
8851,"Don't get me wrong I can totally understand why people are not happy with this, I'm not exactly happy either but I can understand why Nintendo wouldn't want to release the game exclusive to a console that hasn't sold well, and instead use it as a new console seller. Of course for me I'd have to look at the price of the NX and the other games planned before dropping any money on it. I agree I would feel cheated if the Wii U version was far inferior, meaning everyone would have to buy an NX that may potentially be quite expensive just to play the 'full' version of the game. "
