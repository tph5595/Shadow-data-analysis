I didn't say it wasn't.

&gt;It was a shitty exploration game

I disagree.

&gt;the mechanics just simply did not allow for it and combat was clunky as fuck.

again... not the subject. Nice opinions though :)"
76817,"nah, you're right. Zelda is much more thorough. Skyrim was just vast, ya know? That's all I was getting at. 

Like, ""damn, I'm genna head over that mountain. Once I do that, I need to go through a valley and into the castle where the mission begins."" Then you fight several times before even getting to the castle and three hours have passed.

Thinking back, WW seemed to capture that with heading to an island and exploring every nook and cranny. So again... I was wrong. (I was thinking more SS)."
