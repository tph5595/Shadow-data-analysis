31421,"You'll still be able to get and play Zelda WiiU. I understand being upset but ""fury?"" That's a bit of an over reaction.

32215,"For me, this news had taken Nintendo from the exception to the ""don't preorder"" mentality to having to treat them the same as every other company. Kinda sucks having them fall like that as a life time fan, but it's a long time coming really."
32850,"Honestly, Nintendo takes just about the right amount of time to release their games. Sometimes it seems a bit too long, but not excessively wrong. The problem is, the rest of the industry doesn't spend enough time on their games.

As for why bother getting the WiiU one? Maybe because you already have a WiiU. If you don't have a WiiU already, sure, you may as well buy an NX to play it. You'd be an idiot if you bought the NX specifically for Zelda WiiU if you already have a WiiU. The only reason you'd go out and get an NX version if you already have a WiiU is because the NX version is miles ahead of the WiiU version. Based on TP, the only difference is how you control the game and that's all opinion."
33110,"I actually quite liked the Wii version of TP. The motion controls worked pretty well. It was obvious it was a Gamecube game, but that didn't detract from the Wii experience.

On your other point, I do agree. At least the Gamecube had a original, main title Zelda game."
33290,"Hell, I didn't buy mine at launch and only after there were a few games I wanted to buy for it and I'm still disappointed."
46800,"Was Twilight Princess the ""inferior version"" on Gamecube? Neither version of TP was an ""inferior version."" It was all opinion on whether you liked the Wii controls or not."
67188,So you're telling me my opinion is wrong. It's all up to opinion whether TP GCN or TP Wii was better.
70585,"Except by stating your opinion as fact...eh, fuck it. The point is the same."
130596,Could be. I'd imagine both would be 1080/60 but the bump in visuals otherwise may be worth it.
