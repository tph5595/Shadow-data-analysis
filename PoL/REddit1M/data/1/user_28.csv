15681,"Agreed. Zelda TP for GC was supposedly completely ready five months before it released. It was held back until after the Wii launch specifically to coerce Zelda fans into buying the Wii.

The fact they feel the need to do that again makes me worry about what the NX is if I need to be tricked into wanting to buy it. Nobody would have complained if the NX had a port a couple months later.

This of course assumes the game is finished and is being held back."
15769,And if they can't it will shatter people's faith in their ability to make great games and this whole stunt might backfire on the NX.
16182,"&gt; but I can understand why Nintendo wouldn't want to release the game exclusive to a console that hasn't sold well

It was always going to get an NX port, but if they'd given it to Wii U owners exclusively for even a month it would have demonstrated goodwill to Wii U owners.

Pushing the launch for NX (hopefully not after like with TP) just feels like they are trying to strongarm Zelda fans into buying the new platform. It was scummy then, still feels scummy now.

What I want to see are NX plans that will make me want the system based on merit, not Nintendo trying to force me to buy it because I absolutely won't be forced."
21926,If the only worthwhile AAA the NX is launching with is Zelda they have bigger problems.
26279,"&gt; There's absolutely no reason why anyone would get an NX just for the new Zelda if they already have a Wii U.

EXACTLY! Which is why it seems unnecessary to not give Wii U owners the game earlier (again assuming the game is finished earlier)."
