61203,"I'm going to get down voted to hell for this, but in my opinion, if you bought a WiiU JUST for the newest Zelda game BEFORE it actually came out, it's a little bit your fault. I do think Nintendo is making a REALLY bad move here, but I don't like seeing people complain that they only bought the WiiU for the new Zelda. If that was the only reason you had to buy a Wii U, then you probably should have waited until the game actually came out. It's not like the Wii U would have disappeared had you not immediately bought it. "
61284,Almost every major console Zelda release has had around 4-5 years between them. So not really anything new here.
