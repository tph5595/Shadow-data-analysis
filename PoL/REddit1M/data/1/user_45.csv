23626,"I think ""like Skyrim"" is too broad a term for this generation of gamers.

Now I don't want it ""like Skyrim"" I want an immersive, open world(ish) Zelda title with a silent protagonist, large unique dungeon designs, some sort of collecting/upgrade system would be cool, and a memorable story.

Not like Skyrim"
