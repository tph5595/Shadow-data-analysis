16852,"Nintendo, we hope you are reading this. This is how you disappoint; not even anger, just disappoint; all of your fans. You promise a game, and then push it back for two years. I'm not one to get mad about a delayed game for polishing purposes, but having to wait another year for a game we were promised over two years ago? This is just disappointing. I love Zelda, and it's hands down my favourite game. But I refuse to buy it on a brand new system, when 90% of the people who bought a Wii U, bought it for Zelda U. You've upset a huge portion of your player base today Nintendo.

Sorry. Rant over. Just.... Uhg."
76691,It is being hinted at March 2017. That's 10 months. A little under a year. That's a bit more than 4-5. My point stands.
