26176,"This doesn't upset me so much as worries me. This is officially the longest time a Zelda game has been delayed, and the Wii U is going to go without a real ""big title"" for yet another year (during which the NX will launch).

What I mean is I'm worried that Zelda U is either in development hell or they are having a hard time porting it to the NX. Maybe the NX itself is having issues. Maybe all of the above.

I'm perfectly willing to wait another year. I'm part of the ""I like all of the games, the series hasn't disappointed me yet"" crowd, so I feel pretty confident I'm going to like it. But things like this just worry me."
