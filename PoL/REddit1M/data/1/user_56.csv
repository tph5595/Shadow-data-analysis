26187,"It took them 5 years to release Skyward Sword, was it worth the wait?

People need to learn that slow development is not a sign of greatness. It's like when people say ""It's ok that Bethesda puts out borderline unplayable games because the games are so big"" and then they wonder why many releases these days are buggy. It's because you lowered your standards. "
26720,It will be a Wii U title ported. 
27548,"Yay, we need another open world game. "
28983,"There are rock people and fish people but the sun rising in the west is the immersion breaker. LOL

Not that there is anything wrong with the Gorons or the Zora but that should be a hint that Zelda and Links world is different from the one outside your window. "
29384,"Wait a minute, your logic is not consistent. A next gen Zelda on a next gen console, you say?

No, it's a current gen Zelda on a next gen console, just like Twilight Princess was on Wii. You say they haven't done it since the Wind Waker so you obviously don't consider Zelda U on the NX to be the same TP on Wii but they are the same. "
31484,"&gt; but with all of the re-masters and couple 3DS games it's not like we've been without all this time. 

You could have played the original versions of all the remasters so you were never 'without'. The re-masters don't change this. "
32144,"This delay likely has nothing to do with improving the game, it's the time they need to finish porting it to the NX. "
35617,Yes they should but they won't because that would hurt the NX launch sales. 
37149,"It was worse, I still haven't finished it, I just can't stand the controls. If the made a traditional control remaster though..."
44311,"You are just redefining 'next gen' to suit your needs. 'Next gen' is not defined by the tech level, it is defined by what generation a console belongs to in relation to where we are now. Wii is last gen, Wii U is current gen, NX is next gen. Zelda U will be a current gen Zelda on a next gen console, just like they did with TP.

Zelda U is a Wii U game being ported to the NX and it will likely only have minimal improvements on the NX, nothing approaching 'next gen'.

You wouldn't consider Mario Kart 8 a next gen game, you would consider it a current gen game and that's all Zelda U is. They would need years more to make it a NX game instead of a Wii U port. 

What this tells us though is that NX will likely have Gamepad support. "
45219,The law that said that you must buy a console on launch day was repealed so you didn't have to buy it this year anyway. 
45473,It's because we are witnessing Nintendo become incompetent with their own franchises. It just so happens that their own franchises are what keeps them in business. 
46810,"TP on the Wii did do things the Gamecube version couldn't do like widescreen and motion controls. We still don't consider the Wii version of TP a next gen game. 

The Mario Kart 8 example was to say that Mario Kart 8 was built as a Wii U game just as Zelda U was. A few improvements on the next system would not make it a next gen game. A complete NX remaster would make it a next gen game but that won't happen with Zelda U just like it didn't happen with TP Wii. "
48258,"&gt; A few things yeah, but they were minute and the game's actual appearance - which is what masses look at - didn't change at all.

...and that's all you should expect from the NX port. 

&gt; It just depends on the improvements. For example, GTAV was considered to have 'current gen' and 'next gen' versions based on the improvements made to it for PS4/Xbone/PC.

Why are you assuming the improvements will be massive? That isn't how Nintendo did it with TP Wii.

&gt; Your idea is that the thing that defines the 'gen' of a game is when it was built, which makes sense, but my definition is based on what the game can do. If it can do things that are only found in the 'next gen', then I consider it to be at least partially next gen, depending on what it does. In the end it's just semantics between us.

No, generations are not defined by the power of a console but rather by it's release date. A new Sega console coming out today would be a current gen console (Wii U, PS4, One) even if it was under/overpowered in comparison.

It isn't just semantics, a game made for a current gen console is a current gen game even if it's ported with minimal changes/improvements. WWHD is current gen but Wind Waker is a Gamecube game. Likewise, Ocarina of Time on the Gamecube is a port of an N64 game, they made some minor graphical changes and that's all. "
49994,"&gt; That's an assumption. It might be right, but I'm not here to act like my assumptions are already facts set in stone. If you'd like to suggest why you think yours are, please take it to that topic I suggested earlier. I'm only here to debate possibilities.

I am not going to another thread to discuss something you brought up here. You said it would be a next gen game on a next gen console. I disagree on the basis that Nintendo didn't make massive changes last time they ported a dual release Zelda game. Shit, they are having enough trouble making HD games as it is, they are not going to make an HD game then remaster it for the NX for a duel release. I see a 0% chance of that happening. 

&gt;If it's defined strictly by release date and nothing else, Zelda releasing on NX in 2017... makes it next-gen. If it has nothing to do with the hardware and capabilities, how exactly is it current gen when it won't be out until the next gen comes? You say the hardware is irrelevant, but at the same time you say its date is the only thing it depends on.

It is current gen because it the current gen console is the Wii U and Zelda U is a Wii U game. This shit is simple, don't make it harder than it is. If they remastered it for the NX, it would be a next gen game but given how slow NIntendo has become, a remastered version wouldn't be out until 2020.

&gt;OoT on Gamecube didn't change anything about the graphics except the color of the buttons. It was a collectors edition of old emulated games.

I think I read that they upscaled the graphics a bit. Maybe not.

51309,"Sorry but 5 years between Zelda releases is showing incompetence in my book. They can't keep going like that. 

Also, Skyward Sword was indeed a step down from Wind Waker and Twilight Princess in my opinion. They have done 4 remasters in the last 5 years. Ocarina 3D, Majora's Mask 3D, WWHD and TPHD. Think about it, even Nintendo knows the gaps are too long. "
52652,"Turning up the settings doesn't make something next gen. What if my old video card could only run Skyrim on Medium but my new one can run it at Ultra High, me cranking up the settings does not make it a next gen game."
65758,"That Nintendo is chasing Skyrim (how did that work out for Bioware with Dragon Age Inquisition?) does not make it ok to put half a decade or more between main games. I personally never wanted an open world Zelda but that's another topic. 

I think 5 years between games in a franchise is too long but even if you don't, having to move this game to the next console even though it was suppose to be out in 2015 and then in 2016 shows a certain degree of incompetence. 



"
77314,"After all the open world games out there right now, do you really think we need another one? Oh and think of all the meaningless fetch quests that will probably be included to pad the game length. Can't wait!"
