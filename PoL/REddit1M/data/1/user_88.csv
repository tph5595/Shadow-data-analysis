Granted, I'm a huge fan of Metroidvanias, and consider games like Metroid Prime and Dark Souls to have the best exploration out there, not typical open world games.

The problem with very open games like Skyrim is, for them to be released in a timely manner, they have to focus on just making sure that there is enough content instead of making sure that said content is particularily interesting.  That being said, its probably a good thing this Zelda is taking a little longer, otherwise we might *actually* get Zelda Skyrim Edition."

You'd never find things like the dungeons of that game or even hidden challenges like the 50 floor pit or solve puzzles to get heart pieces in Skyrim.  You don't remember what it was like to explore and uncover places like the snow mansion?"

I know they are very different games, and we are definitely making an unclean comparison, but the comparison springs up because the new Zelda kinda necessitates it, and Nintendo will have to decide what kind of game it actually wants to make.  

I will say that I think  Skyrim does lack variety.  It has variety in certain regards, such as builds and classes and such, but it lacks variety in things like dungeons, or...places.  It just kind of all blurs together.  Every now and then there's a great questline but it feels like I have to slog through hours of content that wouldn't even be interesting if it wasn't in such a massive world.

Zelda is quite a bit more linear than Skyrim, and if you like that freedom that won't feel as nice.  However, it doesn't bother me.  What Zelda does typically offer tends to be top notch.  They hide fantastic secrets and puzzling massive dungeons in joyful worlds that I love to explore.  Each location is distinct and memorable, not just for it's visual style, but for the level design, the challenges, and the secrets you can find as well.  This is what I mean when I say I prefer the exploration in Zelda.  After a point in Skyrim I dread finding new dungeons, I can't say I've ever experienced that in any Zelda game except maybe the first one.

It's fine if you disagree with me, Skyrim's popular, so is Zelda, they both offer things people like.  Skyrim is definitely known in the business as the quantity game though (for real, how many times have you heard wide as an ocean, deep as a puddle?)  But that's the nature of making an open world game.  When you are putting that much content in, you need a crazy budget, crazy number of people, and a crazy amount of time to make content that's even halfway decent.  You are usually sacrificing some quality for the sake of having more hours of stuff to do in the game.  And when it comes to having stuff, Skyrim's one of the best, but it's not what I want out of an exploration game, I want quality content.  As a test, is there any dungeon in Skyrim that you can actually remember the layout to?  It was worse in say, Oblivion, Skyrim did make some improvements, but I don't like large open worlds for the sake of having a large open world.

You can feel free to disagree with me, I kinda thought that was already established before this that you don't. ;p"

They went hyper linear with Skyward Sword which I thought was a mistake, and I'm cautiously optimistic about the new Zelda.  To be frank, it seems like every game franchise these days decides it needs to go ""open world"".  Sometimes it's successful, but open world is a whole different game formula.  Zelda approaching this style of gameplay could be great, but it requires a lot of work.  I don't want a diluted experience, so to speak.  I want that world to be filled with interesting things.  If it's not, then it's no better than a larger version of the field you like to mention from Twilight Princess, which was a small part of that game.  To me, if that's what came of the open world format for Zelda, that would be tragic."
