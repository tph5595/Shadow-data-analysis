46671,"Yes, the most likely inferior version."
47185,"And I waited that month to play the real version of TP with normal controls. Haven't played the Wii version to this day. I suspect that the NX one will be the definitive version this time, however."
47496,"Considering it's been in development for the Wii U for around 5 years, and is still coming out for it, I'm betting the NX version will be a slight graphical upgrade, nothing more. It's a port, after all."
47636,"Since the NX is supposedly a console/portable combo, I'm hoping it will be backwards-compatible with Wii U games. For Mario Kart and Maker, at least."
47694,"You're getting the inferior version of a product, in this case."
47991,"NX will *probably* have a proper controller (likely with a screen on it so it can be used on its own), so the mirrored waggle debacle hopefully won't repeat."
48231,I'd still choose a Wii U. But only because PS4 exists.
48502,"Don't forget the Virtual Boy! Dubious company for the Wii U to be in, to be sure."
48538,"In Japan, ""Yes"" means ""No""."
49444,"While it's possible the NX will use the already-old-in-2012 tech of the Wii U, I'd say it's highly unlikely."
49594,"Well, they did add waggle to TP, so if there's some new gimmick to the NX they can shoehorn in, they very well might. I'm guessing it will be the better version overall, but Nintendo's never added significant content to ports other than SNES to GBA ones, as far as I can recall."
49926,"No, in that case the GC version was the better one. I'm guessing that the NX version won't have waggle and mirroring."
52993,"Ugh, I hope not! :("
68798,"No, I'm just stating my opinion as fact. Your opinion is equally valid."
