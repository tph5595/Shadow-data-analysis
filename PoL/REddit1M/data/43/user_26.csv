9212,"What contributes to the progression bonuses? I'm at like 60 shrines completed and only one divine beast down and I'm getting weapons and such with bonuses in them. And I think my Lynels are white? When do I know I'm the last progression ""level"" and what contributes to getting there? Just Shrines?"
9957,Where do you see this percentage bar? And surely I don't have to do all the Korok seeds to unlock the Last Lynels (Silver?) and best weapons drops?
11803,"Okay, but what are the milestone percentages? Does anyone know? And what are all the bonuses?"

16440,Thank you for understanding what I was asking. I just started hunting Lynels and they all dropped Savage Bows but only normal and mighty weapons =\
