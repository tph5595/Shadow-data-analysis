776,"I just encountered my first Rita (I think that's their name, the bird species) playing an accordion, but they've been referenced in the flashbacks.  But here's my question, am I supposed to remember them from previous Zelda games?

I've only played and handful, but my thought was that somehow they're related to Skyward Sword.  I recognized all the other species that had champions controlling the divine beasts, but this one didn't ring a bell."

I mean, PH picks up (I've been told) right after the end of WW, so I know they don't somehow smash their ships into rocks while sailing away, haha."
