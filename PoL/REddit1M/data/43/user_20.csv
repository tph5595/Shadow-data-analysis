7421,"I found the Shora Hah aka ""Blue Flame"" shrine last night. I've completed over 80 other shrines. This is the first shrine where I've gotten ""stuck"" by having no normal arrows. Will any other arrow type carry a blue flame?

They provided you a torch, so if they were required, why weren't any arrows provided? You can walk with the torch (and crouch) under the 3 water spouts. You can also almost throw the lit torch all the way over on to the elevator. You can even time-stop the spiked ball and run and use magnesis to get it to activate the switch. But you can't get any farther..."
