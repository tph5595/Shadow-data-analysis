601,"Not looking for specific hints, just general advice. I have only 6 shrine quests and 15 side quests left to unlock... I've revisited every city and stable... I can't unlock the quests... what am I missing? 

Again please general tips only. "
911,Are these shrines visible? The last time I randomly stumbled on one was the snowball shadow one... but could have easily missed it too. 
1082,They were in Wind Waker. In that story they evolved from the Zora. This is still supported in this game on account of both species having the same color variations. 
1132,Right. And then the riddle. I'm assuming the last six are similar to this. .. :-( 
11281,"All I know is I have six shrine quests unlocked (per game's count) and 114 completed. Nothing will beep for me any more. I'm just going to the more remote areas I haven't spent much time on, like various mountains and some of the geredu desert, North central, the canyon, everything else I feel like I've criss crossed plenty.

Hmmm. "
11535,North west. By the town exit where it's just a hill.
