If you are still early in the game, I would suggest the southeast area first, then Zora or Rito second. You get really useful gear from the southeast (Hateno &amp; Lurelin) &amp; Zora and a really useful reward for finishing Rito. Not combat oriented stuff, but quality of life, help you explore better stuff, which is tremendously useful early game."
