25740,what are the strengths of those? Are they better than farming ancient weapons from the Major Tests of Strength?

26055,"Wow, really? This is the first I'm hearing of this - do you have a link to a previous thread on the topic?"

26783,"well thankfully I'm at an 80%+ success rate for parrying lasers, so not worried about buying the shield. The durability boost does sound nice, but with how many guardians I had to kill just to farm enough cores to get the initial armor set I'm not sure I want to do that again just to buy the weapons &gt;_&lt;. Thanks for the info! Might have to stick to just farming the tests of strength for weapons for the time being :P"
