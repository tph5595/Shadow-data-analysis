5596,"Best 1 handed weapon is probably some Lynel sword, although you *can* get Guardian swords that do like, 50+ damage and that combined with ancient armor buff does a shit ton of damage. But I also really like Lizal tri-boomerangs. They do a lot of damage (36 isn't bad at all for a relatively common weapon) and being able to throw them at enemies is a great way to conserve arrows. 

Best 2 handed weapon is probably a great flameblade because you'll never need flint again. I don't often use 2 handed weapons in combat because I like to be able to shield, and their slow attacks aren't my style. 

Best spear has got to be Mipha's trident. I love the design. It's not the best in terms of damage but I love it. Second place would be an electric spear. Making enemies drop their weapons so you can scoop them up. It's great. 

Best non-Hylian shield would probably be some sort of Lynel shield, or maybe a Royal Guard shield. "

They bring back all the dead enemies, but they don't make new enemies come running at you or anything. "
