13202,What are the verified in-game material requirements to upgrade the Ancient Armor to level 4? Someone said the guide is wrong. Is it 3 star fragments and 3 ancient cores per piece or in total for the 3 pieces?
13368,No bonus completion benefits.
17179,3 stars and 6 ancient cores total for the 3 pieces to level 4  - thank you!

21753,Ramella offers higher prices for the gems you sell to her. Does anyone have the list of the specific prices offered for each gem type?

84558,Could I trouble someone to put on the Champion's Tunic and use Urbosa's Fury on a couple of high HP bosses and let me know what specific number the damage yields? I am seeing folks report numbers anywhere from 300 - 700 and am curious if we can get a definitive answer. Thanks!
