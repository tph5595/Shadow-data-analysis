63975,I used stamps to trace a path. Had no idea about the proper way. Blew a good hour on it :)
64526,I have not once needed these contraptions. I use bomb arrows.

65007,"You don't need to fill in any gap, it's just one of the lanes at the top of the hill. Trial and error."
65096,Sounds like a software bug. I've never even heard of this. Return your game for a new copy if you can.

Takes away a little more than third of a blue Hinox's HP, and they have 800.

So about tree, tree fiddy."

65979,Complete the Tarry Town side quest and there'll be a guy on the balcony of the building to the (right?) of the bridge thing (town entrance/exit). He sells you unique stuff you've lost.
66213,"There is a formula to it. Once you understand, you'll know exactly what you get every time. Cooking ""mighty"" [plant/meat/fruit] yields attack boost, etc.

Don't mix status effects, it'll come out as a normal food item that restores hearts, or worse Dubious Food.

Use critters and only 1 monster part for elixirs. Adding more monster parts doesn't do anything.

The rarity of the cooking ingredient contributes to the potency. For example, an elixir made with a Moblin part lasts longer than an elixir made with Chu-Chu Jelly."
