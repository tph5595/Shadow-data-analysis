Wrong, they increase the effect duration.
[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/61ccva/botw_cooking_math_complete/) is a great post, including a spreadsheet that explains exactly how cooking works, and what every ingredient does. 

&gt; The rarity of the cooking ingredient contributes to the potency. For example, an elixir made with a Moblin part lasts longer than an elixir made with Chu-Chu Jelly.

That's only partly right - the exact monster part tiers and durations are listed in the spreadsheet that's linked in the topic above."
