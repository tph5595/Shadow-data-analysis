4278,"bests are all ancient weapons you can craft at the Akkala laboratory.

Not only they got way higher durability than other weapons, but they benefit from the Ancien proficiency set bonus you get with an upgraded ancient armor, which gives you a nice 80% atk bonus that stacks with mighty meals/elixir"
6124,"not only they respawn all downed ennemies (including overwolrd bosses and shrine guardians), they also increase the critical success rate of coocking during the spoopy music"

9889,"yes, and apparently it refills his HP"
14272,"Yes it's a shrine.

There a specific path for the snowball to take so analyze carefully the topography"
14375,there's a shrine there yes
20525,"It's Namika Ozz Shrine, north East of the Hyrule Field (or south west of woodland stable). Problem is that it will drop the meteor rod instead, but keep it in mind for [the korok quest that ask you for an ice rod, because there's one that drops a blizzard rod that gives you a bigger reward for this particular quest](/spoiler)

For an easy fire rod, there's a wizzrobe carrying one just south of outskirt stable (and also moblins with normal clubs that you'll also need for that same quest)"
20598,"sadly the ""flower bed"" you get is a bit underwhelming"
20760,"never got her to buy ember (or opal for that matter) again.

Also you can't really get her to buy a certain type of gems. She will change gem each time, but if you're not lucky she will ask for the same. Probabilities seems to be linked with ores rarity (so topaz&gt;ruby&gt;sapphire&gt;diamond)"
26421,"about the same damage but between 66 to 100% more durability compared to ++ weapons

Now the question is do you wanna spend ancient cores for more durability or not

(Important to note that the shield reflect guardian beams without parry and the bow got little to no drop, that's why they both require giant instead of small cores)"
28333,As we say in Lordran : *May the flames guide thee*
28873,"&gt; I made it through the torch part then get lost once those stop being a thing.

I'm perfectly aware of that"
65802,"you have to manually empty it (don't worry, memory pictures can't be deleted)

Be wary if you have some quest pictures though, they are marked with a red exclamation point"
66306,"durability wise, the best are the unique weapons you get after finishing a divine beast. Can be reforged with a diamond plus other materials

Then followed by the ancien weapons you can craft in the akkala laboratory with ancient cores.

After that comes the savage lynel weapons, dropped by white and silver maned lynels

Then the royal weapons (not to be confused with the royal guard ones)."
78679,all three are near shrines of the great plateau
78717,The only canon one as far as I know was Ganondorf in OOT

105986,"They have higher durability according to the official guide so both.

Although I don't think they can get modifiers"
