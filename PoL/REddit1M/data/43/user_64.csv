27331,"I have been playing the game sans guide trying to discover everything on my own. I want to let the game guide me with hints and whatnot, and exploration to find new things. 

However I am completely stumped on the Master Sword. I figured it's in the Lost Woods, and assumed doing the divine beasts would give me a hint since every leader mentioned it, but they ultimately just told me it's exactly where I thought it would be. I can't find my way through the woods and I haven't found any hints. 

Could anyone, without telling me how to actually get through the woods, tell me if there is an NPC or hint somewhere to figure it out on my own? I'd like to just get on track to figuring it out, but don't want to look it up completely. "

Do you know if there's an NPC somewhere that gives a hint? I'm hoping to figure it out that way instead of getting a direct answer here. "
31393,Well I'm not really looking for an answer of how to get through if that makes sense. I just want to know if there's any place in game that gives hints on it. 
33680,"Found him! I thought it was a throwaway line about being sent to the beginning but just realized what it meant. Giving it a shot now. Thanks for the help!

Edit: that did it. Can't believe I didn't put two and two together before. Thanks again!"
35793,"Well I was asking for a hint on where to find a hint in game, not a direct hint, but thank you. 

I also didn't realize the solution until I found that in game hint again anyway; I didn't realize you were supposed to use the fire that way at all to begin with. "
