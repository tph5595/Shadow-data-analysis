2460,"Can someone give me a general idea of where to find the tower in the gerudo (?) mesa area? The snowy plateau just north of the gerudo desert. 


I found a shrine just north of the yiga clan base, but I've spent a couple hours running around and can't seem to find the actual tower anywhere. I haven't been able to spot it from the other towers either. Is it super far west or something?"
