33181,"I vaguely remember an old guy saying something about the Lost Woods and I THINK he may have been at the stable east of the tower  in the region where the Lost Woods is. I can't find the name of the stable right now, but the shrine behind it is in a pond with cliffs behind the shrine. If it's not that stable it's one of the one's close to/south of the Lost Woods.

Edit: I think it might be the Woodland Stable?"
