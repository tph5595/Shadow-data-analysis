11239,"Speaking of, what happens if you throw it for the 'break' crit? Can you even throw it?"
11281,Beat the game. Percentage shows up on map once you do so
11526,Does skipping the cutscene skip the moon? I think that happened to me last night while amiibo farming in Kakariko :S
11596,"Yeah, I found outrunning 3 guardians to be easy, just time your sprints, don't hold it down the whole time, and zig zag before the beam hits"
11652,I remember seeing it and realizing I gotta climb the cliff and ledges to get a gliding start or else I won't be doing it without burning stamina food
11699,"I was aiming for it but ended up in the desert... Once I got close to Gerudo town, I was able to see it from that angle... Climb a cliff or two before you see it. I'll let you see it to figure out the climb :)"
11748,"Oh man, enjoy! That game is gorgeous, the music is wonderful and just a fun game period. I think WW and TP are easily my top 2

Edit: The Rito look different in WW, just a heads up :) But you'll know who they are"
13595,I was honestly surprised I remembered it so vividly when I got there on WW HD.
13720,"Um, Korok seeds, shrines, compendium, uncovering a named location on the map. There's some breakdowns on here that give you the specific percentage earned for specific tasks I listed"
13739,Weird... the moon vanished when I did. Don't know wtf happened
13779,"Do it in style, Climb the highest mountain and throw it, glide after it and see if you can find it... Imagine losing it in some ditch lol"
14158,"I assume you're right.

Well shoot, I thought throwing a Master Sword from a mountain or into death mountain would be neat lol"
22541,"oooh! Thanks! ugh, shoulda cooked lol"
23105,"Have you beaten the game? I heard once you do, all the quests get listed so you can tell what's active, completed or missing"
41062,Hmm well i dunno lol
84901,"Wouldn't different enemies have different defense stats?

(Don't even know if there IS a defense stat, but seems likely)"
84994,"No idea what the area looks like but from the sounds of it, wouldn't you be able to updraft/glide up close and fire an arrow at the target? (Again, don't know the area at all lol, just basing this on you trying to get rocks up there via stasis)

Sidenote, hammers and bombs might be more effective for stasis on rocks"
85061,"HOW DO YOU KNOW, DINAH?"
85095,"However, if you don't have the quest yet, you won't know and will have to take the pic again"
85207,I feel like many MANY people wanted to tell you to run from Hateno :P
85244,Kakariko sidequests... Get on em!
85279,Please restate your comment in the form of a question
85429,"Gems are used mostly in level 3 and 4 gear upgrades, as far as I've seen"
85440,And so many goddamn star fragments :(
85486,"Boss rush will most likely be a patch... Ok, not a patch, a paid DLC"
85617,"Just thought of this... If you walked up to a shrine to trigger the name appearing on the screen, but didn't use your slate to activate it, would it show on the map? (Unless that's what you meant by 'looking at them')"
85673,"&gt; pay attention to the music 

Just like OoT"
85747,"&gt; How do you get fire somewhere there isn't?

Arson?

"
85797,"Dueling Peaks, Dale :P"
86748,"Oh, I'm sorry. We were looking for 'Who is Lou Diamond Phillips?'

So close, you still have the board"
86781,Good to know! So those that seem tougher are just stacked in hp
86794,Oh sweet jesus!
