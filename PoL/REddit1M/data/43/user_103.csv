75281,"I'm down to my last 5 shrines and I'm trying hard not to use guides. None of them are shrine quests. I have no idea where to even look. Has anyone here who found them all without help have any advice for me? It's starting to feel monotonous running around to areas that look sparsely populated on my map, and finding nothing. "

* One-handed

Toss up between Blizzard Rod, and Lizal Tri-boomerang with a high attack roll 

* Two-handed 

Toss up between Spring-Loaded Hammer and Giant Boomerang with a high attack roll. 

* Spear 

I always have two things. 1) An open inventory slot. 2) A Thunderspear. Force them to drop their weapon, take it, break it on them. 

* Shield 

Ancient Shield because it looks like a cool eyeball. 

Note: I'm not even kidding about the Blizzard Rod and the Thunderspear. These are the two most OP items in the game. Blizzard Rod will freeze everyone in the vicinity for a long ass time and the Thunderspear is the fastest attack animation and the longest reach melee weapon that forces weapon drops. IIRC it even forces shield drops on a blocked hit if they have a metal shield. Will test shortly and confirm. You don't even have to take their weapon if you don't want to, because they will often ignore you slapping them silly while they try to pick it up. It's an easy way to be a cheapskate about weapon durability though. 

If you're just asking about raw damage output, it's ancient weapons, because of reasons described by the others already. Lynel weapons are inferior, unless you get an absurdly high roll, because ancient proficiency stacks with attack up food. Within the ancient weapons I believe it's the Bladesaw, due to the wombo combo of statis+ and a spinning attack. 

Did some science, hitting a shield directly with a thunder weapon will force only the shield to drop. If you get a direct body shot with a Thunder weapon, they drop both the weapon and the shield. This is recommended, because hitting a shield directly with a weapon causes greater durability loss. "
