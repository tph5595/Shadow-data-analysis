7502,"I did the same thing, running around aimlessly in the highlands. It's nowhere near that. It's near the north edge of the desert where it isn't snowing."
7681,"Can someone clear up what makes harder enemies appear? I at first read, and assumed it was correct, that the more you defeat, black and silver ones start to appear.

Then I read that freeing the Divine Beasts increases the likelihood. But I was getting silver everything before my third divine beast."
9714,"The goron area is called Gut Check Rock. It's in Northeast Eldin area, to the left of Skull Lake in Akkala. Keep going west at the very top of the map and you'll run into the large skeleton, and the Lynels. It's all north of Death Mountain at the very edge of the map."
9920,"There are some shrines not attached to any quests, that also do not beep on your radar. You have to break some sort of opening sometimes, or solve a simple puzzle.

They are very well hidden, and I gave up and looked up the last 10 I couldn't find.

Edit: they very well may be parts of shrine quests, as someone mentioned the stone tablets near them sometimes, but a few I believe do not. But I could be wrong."
10177,"Lucky. I killed a Lynel and RIGHT as he exploded, the blood moon triggered, and he respawns right next to his own exploding body. No loot. Had to fight him again."
10230,"Not sure why you got downvoted, a blood moon does indeed make all your cooking critical."
11458,"I did not even know this. But gone are the days of my guardian farming, at least for this playthrough."
11877,"They think you're talking about the map percentage.

As far as loot, I don't believe anything changes as far as chests. It usually all low to mid tier weapons. As you kill more enemies or free Divine Beasts, it's believed both of those contribute to the mobs leveling up and carrying better weapons.

I started farming Lynels and before I knew it, they were all white maned and much harder. I finished my 3rd Divine Beast quests and they upgraded to back maned silver Lynels, the strongestâ€‹ in the game."
