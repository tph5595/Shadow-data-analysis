18721,"A few days back I was following the bleep bleep to a shrine and came upon a bunch of large tree trunks that were open in the middle and there was one of every wizzrobe frolicking around inside the open trunks, and the shrine was also in one of the larger trunks.

Any idea where this is? I need a fire rod for a quest and I know I saw one there. Plus that was a neato area I want to explore some more."
