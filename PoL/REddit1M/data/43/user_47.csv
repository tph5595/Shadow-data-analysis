17179,I bought the flowers for my house in Hateno village but there is nothing there. How do I get flowers?
24432,"That sucks. I did notice there was a few white flowers maybe a couple of feet in front of my house, but they weren't in rows or anything. I was hoping I would be able to plant stuff like Hyrule Herbs, but I guess not. Hopefully we get some more house customization in the DLC. Thanks!"
