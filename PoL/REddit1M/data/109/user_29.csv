47356,There is no timeline
53023,"Yeah sure. I don't believe in the timeline as set by Hyrule Historia. It's a construct to stop fans from asking where the official Zelda timeline is in my opinion.

I believe that every Zelda that's not a direct sequel or prequel has nothing to do with each other. It's obvious that Majora's Mask is directly after Ocarina of Time, it's obvious that Phantom Hourglass is directly after Wind Waker.

The rest of the links between games for me are more easter eggs to me than evidence for one timeline. Even Nintendo says there's three timelines. Why only three? If you can believe in three timelines you can believe in four, six, twelve etc.

I don't need to fit every game in a single (or dual, or tripple) timeline to enjoy them. I believe games take place in a timeframe set by the director.

Zelda games are made on a set of gameplay elements, not on a set of story elements. Therefore the story comes after gameplay, level design, sound design, art direction etc.

They don't make a game with the timeline in mind equals, for me, as a fact, that there is no timeline that they work of.

Fitting games in after it's made in a time line also equals to me that there is no timeline."
54820,"Miyamoto also said that Ocarina of Time comes before The Legend of Zelda, as stated in Nintendo Power in 1998.

**Nintendo Power:** *Where do all the Zelda games fall into place when arranged chronologically by their stories?*



**Miyamoto:** *Ocarina of Time is the first story, then the original Legend of Zelda, then Zelda II: The Adventure of Link, and finally A Link to the Past. It's not very clear where Link's Awakening fits in--it could be anytime after Ocarina of Time.*

Miyamoto contradicts himself, the Historia and the games. Why is it so important to some people that there is a timeline? Does it make the games better? Do the games not hold value if there isn't a timeline?"
226538,"Yeah that's also my view on the 'timeline'. But it's also a big *whatever* to me. I just enjoy the games, if it's a good stand alone story that's cool, if it has some easter eggs to previous games that's cool."
