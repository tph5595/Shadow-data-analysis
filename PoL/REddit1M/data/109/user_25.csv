Majora's Mask is the best Zelda game, with Link to the Past coming in at a close second.

Please argue."

It's possible we're talking about different things when we say how good this of that game is, but ultimately what matters for me is how fun the game is to play. The OoT designers deserve tons of credit for what they did, but a revolutionary game isn't necessarily fun to play. I prefer the overall polish of Twilight Princess."
92305,"When I rate games I take into account mostly how much fun I have playing them. Link to the Past was my favorite Zelda for a long time (it has the best boss fights and one of my favorite inventories, a great soundtrack and lots of very memorable moments). Majora's Mask climbed to the top when I started speedrunning it, just because of how much fun that was. Those two are still the games I come back to the most because they're the ones I have the most fun playing."
