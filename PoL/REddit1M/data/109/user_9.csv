The only Zelda game that I *don't* like, however, is A Link to the Past. I cannot get myself to like that game. Puzzles are boring, combat is boring, and even the bosses are boring. The whole game feels tedious to me. It's also the only Zelda that I haven't bothered trying to complete. After the second Dark World dungeon, I was done."
