80209,"I don't think that Ocarina of Time is all that good.

I'm sure that a big part of this is because unlike many, I don't have any nostalgia for it. I never owned an N64 and have only been able to play it now on the Wii U. 

To me, it just hasn't aged very well. It's aged much worse, I think, than even the games that came before it. The controls are often a bit underesponsive, the pacing feels slow, and a lot of the open world puzzles - including many that you need to complete to advance in the game - are almost merciless in how little guidance or  what little hints you get at what to do. The dialogue is also much, much cheesier than the other games, a bit too much for me, and the unrelenting help text gets old about 40 hours before you finish the game.

This isn't helped in that having played Twilight Princess first, it just feels like the same game with better graphics and major improvements in all of the areas I mentioned. I think if I'd played OoT when it was in it's original run I would probably feel differently, but not having done so it just seems like one of the worst games in the franchise to me."
