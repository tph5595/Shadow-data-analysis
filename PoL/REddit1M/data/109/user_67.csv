Boss battle? HEY!
About to do something you were about to do without her telling you?LOOK!
Actually doing something she was about to tell you to do? 
LOOK!

If fairies were real in our world as they are in the Peter Pan world I'd have clapped while she was bouncing around in a blender. She's the worst thing about OoT, which is a great game otherwise.

Fi is almost as bad but not as annoying. It's just that she was holding your hand the whole time with her percentages. 

I think it was more about Navi yelling ""Hey"" and ""Listen"" that was annoying. It's not what she said but how she said it. And that probably says more about me than it does her. "
