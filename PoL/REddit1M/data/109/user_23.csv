42250,"Personally, I don't feel like Majora's Mask is all that great. The main story of the game, while unique and rather dark, is literally played like a straight line. As a young kid I never finished it because I found it confusing, I replayed it recently and personally found it to be one of the easiest Zelda games (in context to just completing the main story). The side quests do add charm and a dynamic life system to the game, however many of them I find are tedious, and you need to constantly restart from day one. While I do like the dynamic system of life in Clock Town, after experiencing it for the fifth or more time because of restarting from day one to complete another side quest, it gets rather old. I don't hate the game by any means, I just feel like it's put on a pedestal it doesn't really belong on. "
