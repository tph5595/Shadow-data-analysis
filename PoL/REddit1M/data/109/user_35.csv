49917,Gameplay &gt; story
49984,Why do you think that? LA and the Oracle games have the best 2D dungeon design
50029,"If they worked properly, I would totally agree"
50140,"Zelda 1 isn't that good, but I wouldn't say devoid of fun. I first played it a few years ago on an emulator, so nostalgia isn't a factor for me. Also, many people in the 80s beat it without a guide.

I also disagree about the sacred realms in SS. They were fun. I only dreaded them because of how scary and tense they were.
"
50349,"I agree with the OoT and TP sentiment. OoT was my favorite Zelda until I played TP, because TP just does everything better.

I don't see how ALttP is the 2nd best Zelda though, even just considering the 2D Zeldas. What AlttP did was set a formula and structure that every Zelda game since has done, except I believe every subsequent game improved upon the formula. (Actually, very similar to your thoughts on OoT and TP)"
50473,Care to elaborate? That's not really an opinion so much as a denial of fact
50497,Definitely the best 2D games
50586,All the dead/dying people in the game isn't dark?
50722,"I calibrated mine. Often. It didn't work very well. I would do a swing and it would interpret it as a completely different swing. It made any part where I had to swing a particular way frustrating. Remember the Girahim fights, where you had to move your sword then slash? No matter how I moved my hand, it either accidentally swung when it wasn't supposed to or it was too slow. I pretty much just brute-forced my way through those battles."
51267,"Well, I just explained factually the problems I had with it, so it shouldn't be hard to understand "
52523,"Uh, no, nice assumption though. I actually love that game. I wanted the controls to work because I wanted to experience the game to its fullest, but it was simply not good at detecting my swings. This may have been because the WiiMotionPlus was messed up, this may have been because the sensor bar was too low (it was on top of the tv but I stood above it) this may have been because I was standing too close to the tv (I was as far away as I could get in the room the wii was in) 

But the fact is, I would swing my arm a certain way, Link would swing his arm another way, about 50-75% of the times I swung. You tell me to grow up, but seeing someone disagree with you and immediately resorting to ""You're dumb and literally made that up so you could say you hate the game"" is extremely immature. "
53220,"This is wrong. The timeline existed before they revealed it to us, so it's impossible that they made it to placate fans. Years before the HH came out, Miyamoto stated that they had a document that related every Zelda to each other. 

Gameplay does indeed come first, but they still later try to find where the game would logically fit in the timeline. "
53650,"I finished the game, so I'm pretty sure it's not a problem of ""getting used to it"" when I did it for ~35 hours"
58619,"That's fair, but I would give it another go! It might be that the game had text popping up everywhere, which slowed things down quite a bit. It also introduced the concept of the segmented overworld, where you can't get to newer areas of the game until you get an item from a dungeon that lets you find the next dungeon, which you may have not been a fan of since you could only explore a small amount of the overworld at the beginning of the game. (I personally love the segmented overworld concept, but I could see why someone else might not.)"
206955,"Nope. There were some areas you couldn't go to at the beginning of the game, but you could go to probably 95% of the overworld map right out the gate. In Link's Awakening you unlock like a 10th of the map each time you get a new item."
