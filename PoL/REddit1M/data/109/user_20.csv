39441,"While I don't know that I'd call every Zelda drastically different, something to note about that summary is that it focuses purely on plot, with vague details at that. It ignores subtler details like tone and characters that are just as important as the bullet point overview. Arguably even more important, it overlooks gameplay.

Everyone likes to say that the gameplay of Zelda is the same. But I'd argue they're all just in a sub-genre that no one else is exploring. New mechanics through items, puzzles and combat are a significant difference all their own, enough that each title feels worth playing.

Which brings me to BotW. To put it bluntly, there are an buttload of open world games right now. It's probably the most common type of AAA game in recent years. And the games that aren't open world are often ridiculously linear, like the wave of hallway FPS that were the big thing before free roaming territory capture. Zelda strikes a unique balance between linearity and exploration, giving things to explore but putting in the time to make those things hand-crafted and worthwhile. I don't know if the open-world focus of BotW will change this. I'd say I'm cautiously optimistic. But I could see why someone would be worried."
