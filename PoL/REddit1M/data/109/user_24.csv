42371,"He's probably referring to how the developers have stated many times that they want to ""break conventions"" and make this Zelda a whole new experience within the franchise.

BotW does change a lot, just judging from the demo."
200012,"People have taken it too far.  The ""timeline"" used to just be connections between legends.  For example, Wind Waker makes some mentions of things that happened in Ocarina of Time, so you can surmise that WW is what happens after OoT at some point.  But that's it.

Beyond that point, people starting picking apart every little detail - details so small and insignificant that they're bound to contradict eachother - to the point of convolution.  The only thing meant to be was that Wind Waker took place - vaguely - after Ocarina of Time, but the insignificant details were made so important by fans that for this to be true, you'd need splits and and parallel events and all sorts of shit that doesn't really add anything to anything.  People tried to make what was supposed to be a simple and vaguely related series of events into a realistically coherent ""history"", and it was never meant to be that.

All of this exposition and extrapolation by fans made Nintendo feel like it was something seriously important to describe and detail, and imo this ended up just taking out a lot of the mystery of the series.  Things that used to be questions should have been left as questions, because trying to tie a bunch of questions with no *real* answer together pretty much never leads to a satisfying result and almost always feels forced."
200518,"Playing as Zelda (or Sheik/Tetra) would be awesome, I agree.

But what would be awesome about swapping Link's gender?  It'd just be Link still, except now a girl for some reason.  What does it add or change, other than model and voice?"
203341,"Nothing, it's the character he is.  Can you answer my question?  What is cool about taking an established guy character and giving him boobs?  It'd be just as silly and pointless as making Zelda a guy for... no reason."
285280,"Now, I prefer (strong) female protagonists to male ones.  They're usually my favorite characters.  Always been a big fan of Motoko Kusanagi from Ghost in the Shell, or Izumi Curtis from Fullmetal Alchemist, and now Rey from the new Star Wars is great - by far my favorite character in the movie.

And I wouldn't mind Link getting more character either, but I don't think that should come in the form of changing his gender without any real reason.  There are reasons to use a female protagonist, but this in itself isn't a reason to just swap gender on a character - who despite being multiple people - has always been the same, rather distinct character.

This is for a few reasons:

1. Changing Link into a girl effectively says ""Screw these other girls you could play as like Zelda or Impa, just give the guy some boobs.""  It ignores the potential to elaborate on other established female characters and instead just goes with the guy again, except now *he's* a girl.

2.  It's tacky, like bad fan art or ""rule 63"".  In good narratives, a good character is a defined entity.  When you swap their gender around willy-nilly, it makes them less defined and more of a malleable vessel that exists as a tool and not as a character.  If I say ""Link"", you know who I'm talking about, regardless of which Link because each of these Links has effectively been the exact same person outside of the game's style.  If a ""girl Link"" exists, that already begins to break down the character.  Now Link is no longer a character who is a boy, *it's* a template that could be whatever, more like an avatar.  You can no longer describe him as ""him"" (or her), because the icon has been broken into different things and is no longer a specifically defined character.

3.  It forgoes original ideas, and relies on a tweaked established idea.  Why not Link's daughter?  Why not a new character?  If it's going to be a girl, which would be fine, why does it still have to be Link?

It just seems like by far the worst, tackiest way to handle using a female lead.  It's *barely* even a female lead when you're just taking a male character and tweaking him into a female."
331759,"&gt;I’m not clear how having a female Hero-equivalent diminishes the role of the female secondary characters. Is the game only allowed to have x number of women? 

That's not even remotely close to what I said.  I said, if we're using a female lead, then why do we just turn the boy into a girl, when there are already good characters that could be used?

You could play as Zelda and experience her side of the adventure for once.  You could play as Impa and see some of that secretive, underlying lore that always comes with the Sheikah.  Or... you could play as Link again, except now a girl.  Why?  It's by far the least interesting of the options.  It ignores all the potential that exists in female characters that are already part of the series and gives you the same thing again, except now with a slightly tweaked figure and voice.

&gt;The notion that female characters are just “men with boobs on” is horrendously phallocentric.

And that isn't what I said, either.  I said a female Link is a ""man with boobs"" - not any other character - because that's literally what it is.  Is Link a boy?  Yes.  If you turn him into a girl, you've taken a *boy* and simply changed his physiology.  You've taken a boy, and given him boobs.

As for my second point, it has less do to with sentimentality and more to do with character definition.  In the same way, I'd prefer Zelda to remain who she is, and for Link to retain his other features outside of gender.  I wouldn't be fond of Link suddenly being a 7 foot tall bodybuilder - because change for the sake of it - either.

&gt;A female version of Link already exists (Linkle) and yet Link as a character has not disappeared into nothingness

Linkle is not ""female Link"" though.  She's a big fan of Link, who imitates him because she thinks he's cool as hell.  She's only ""female Link"" in the way that a fan who dresses up as a character is an alternate gendered version of that character.  She's basically a cosplayer, and beyond that, Hyrule Warriors isn't canon and doesn't really have any effect on the actual series.

&gt;As I said to someone elsewhere in this thread, choosing your gender in Pokemon hasn't diminished the iconicity of Ash Ketchum.

You don't play as Ash in the Pokemon games.  You play as a much less distinct *avatar* named ""Red"" by default. There is no ""female Ash.""

&gt;Tweaking an established idea is the centre point of making new stuff; art or whatever. Saying ""why gender swap when he's always been male"" is just being adverse to change. Why change anything, ever?

To improve it, and this doesn't ""improve"" anything by itself. Imo, you need a reason to change something.  Change for the sake of change is often detrimental without a real point behind it.  Change because you've thought of an idea that might improve something for the better/fun/more interesting is the way to go, and that's been the reason behind all new ideas in Zelda games.  This change for example doesn't really improve or experiment with anything meaningful.  It's just a change because ""Why not?"", and the answer is that there are various other better ways to handle the end result.  You'd ""gain"" the same things by using an actual female character, and I'd have a lot more respect for a change like that which utilized these characters over just taking Link and altering his gender.

&gt;whether that’s female gamers feeling they have some on-screen representation without relying on secondary characters

Representation is equal to the to demographic buying these games.  Like I said, I like female leads, but the reason we see more male ones is because there are more males playing and buying the games.

&gt;or general gamers wanting a revitalised interpretation of the Hero of Hyrule, or providing an opportunity to expand the Hero’s role into something more explorative, 

But that isn't reliant or dictated by whether or not he's a girl.  You could have those things without changing his gender, and changing his gender wouldn't necessarily accomplish those things by itself.  You could easily (and probably) end up with the exact same thing you've always had, except with higher-pitch grunts and a slightly different model.  On the other hand, you could keep Link's gender and flesh out the things that make him who he is, achieving the same potential result you spoke of.  The point is that Link's gender is barely relevant to that. "
418982,"&gt;such a game will always be a spinoff because it’s dealing with secondary characters.

I disagree.  They're only secondary because they're not the lead *in those games*, but there's no reason a game called ""The Legend of Zelda"" can't feature Zelda as the *lead*.  You yourself vehemently believe change by itself is a great thing, and playing as Link/The Hero - whether male or female - is a lot more the same than playing as Zelda or another female character from the series.  You say my argument is inconsistent, but that's the most inconsistent thing here.  You want change, but you deny the possibility of something that would bring much *more* change.  Link is Link.  Girl or boy, you're still playing as Link, and that's not much of a change outside of aesthetics.  Playing as Zelda or Impa would not only be a greater change, but a much more ""sensical"" one which would inherently bring something different from the story than your typical, samey Link deal.  Can you not agree with that?  With Link, whether he's a male or female, you're almost certainly still going to get the same old, slightly tweaked story that you always do.  With Princess Zelda, the story would be on the complete other side of the tracks.  With Impa, it'd involve things which have only been hinted at so far.  I'd find that *way* more of an interesting change than just making Link a girl this time around.

&gt;Would a female Hero change the Zelda series?

Technically, yes.  In any meaningful way?  Not necessarily.  It *could*, if they focused on it and gave story to it, but that isn't a given just by changing Link into a girl.  The only thing *given* by doing that is the fact that he is now a girl.

What they *could* do from a gameplay/story wise with a female Link is a whole different discussion.  Female Link just by itself only changes two things:  The character model and the voice.

&gt;I’m afraid you’ll have to explain how that kind of shake-up to the series wouldn’t be a worthwhile contribution. 

Because by itself, it isn't much of a shake up at all, and by default playing as *someone other than Link* would be far more of a shake up.

&gt;If you’re not able to comprehend that women playing the game would derive some enjoyment from a female Hero, or dudes who think it would be a cool flavour to add

I can comprehend it, but there's a reason you posted this in an ""unpopular opinion"" topic, is there not?

&gt;then I can only assume you’ve played nothing but games where the protagonist resembles you every time, and can’t see the value in a character resembling anyone else. An attitude for which I have very little respect, and even less patience. 

Please stop making strawman arguments.  Link does not resemble me at all.  Nor does Mario, or Olimar, or any male character I've played as and I'd think you'd be able to surmise why this is.

&gt;But what change isn’t change for the sake of it?!

Change that is meant to improve something.  I could say ""Let's take the puzzles out of Zelda.  It's change so it's good!"" but that would be silly because change *by itself* isn't inherently good.  A bullet hole in my head would be a change from my current state, but I sure wouldn't welcome it just for the sake of change. 

You cite their motion controls, a change that was pretty much universally panned outside of the extremely casual audience, so that's not exactly the best argument for ""change is good"".  That change lost them their third party support, and it only gained them the reputation of a company who relies on gimmicks too much.  Their latest, biggest game (Star Fox) just flopped horrendously because of that forced change.  It would have done well without it.

&gt;What?! How on earth does her back story change anything?

...Because she's not *actually* Link?  She's not a Hero?  She has nothing to do with the Triforce of Courage?  She's some random girl from Hyrule who saw Link and thought ""damn that's cool ima do that.""  She's a fan, and nothing more.  If some guy puts on a dress and starts acting like Zelda, it doesn't make him *actually* Zelda.

Frankly, I'm not a fan of anything that Hyrule Warriors does aside from gameplay.  It's one of the tackiest, corniest things I've ever experienced.  It's made by a company whose claim to fame is boob physics, and whether or not they have a girl who dresses up as Link in it is totally irrelevant to me.  A company who can only rarely design a female character which isn't centered around her boobs is not one that I'm ever going to look at and say ""Yeah, that's a respectable design decision.""

&gt;If I remember correctly, Ash was also a name that was an option when you choose at the start of the game. And so what about the name? You can choose Link’s name as well but he’s still otherwise known as Link. 

You can name him whatever you want.  Naming him Brock doesn't make him Brock from the show.  Ash Ketchum is not Red.  Ash Ketchum has a very specific character and background; one that is different from Red's.  The best you could say is that Ash Ketchum is *based* on the original Red, but they're not the same person.

&gt;Ahh, and here we have the most subjective of the whole discussion. And it’s hard to explain this without repeating myself, but most of this is just down to personal taste and opinion. I think a female Hero IS an improvement.

We simply have different opinions.  Female Hero?  Sure, I'm all for it.  Female version of Link?  I see no point in it.  Your points about letting female gamers have more representation in the industry are fine.  I just don't think it should come in the form of taking a male character and making him female, in the same way I think it'd be silly to have a Larry Croft in place of Lara.

&gt;You’re welcome to have your own opinion on this. But, given your distaste for female or bodybuilder Links, even though I’ve demonstrated both have existed and were perfectly valid contributions to the series, forgive me for not trusting your instincts on this entirely. 

The Goron Mask (or fierce deity) transformations are a far stretch away from completely changing an established character at its default.  It's a temporary trait *applied* to this character, and that's why it works.  Not only that, but it has gameplay reasoning behind it, something which ""female Link"" does not.

&gt;They’re male because more males play the game, or more males play the game because they’re male? And how is this not more of a reason to introduce female Hero’s? Male gamers can have more realistic, not-phallocentric game worlds, and women can feel a higher level of identification, possibly tapping into a greater demographic. That is a thing to be sought, not a reason to withhold it. 

That's a fine stance to have, but the reasoning is *far* more complex than that.  There are an endless amount of variables that make up the interests of your average male and average female.  The demographic isn't going to change drastically just because there are more girl characters.  It would take ages of change in the way our society works for that demographic to change drastically.

That change has already been happening.  The difference between interest in male and females has blurred *a lot* in the past 50 years, but it's still there.  We'll get there eventually, though.

&gt;How?! Someone’s gender is a big part of someone, if changing it for a popular character was so non-consequential then we wouldn’t have such an outcry whenever it’s suggested

In reality?  It sure is.  In Zelda, especially for Link?  Not necessarily at all.  Like you said, you can have these things with or without changing his gender.  His gender is irrelevant to whether or not the character gets fleshed out and elaborated upon.  You *could* have a female Link who brings a lot of depth to the character, just like you *could* have it with a male Link, but it's not a given on either side.  It's something that might happen, that *could* happen, regardless of gender, but *probably* won't because Nintendo doesn't give two shits about character depth and story development.

The gender is inconsequential to the game's story and gameplay, yes, unless of course they made a point to focus on it, but I don't wanna see ""gender studies"" in Zelda.  The reason people oppose it are for the reasons I stated above, not because it has some great impact on the game itself.  They oppose it because they find it pointless, tacky and odd, and because it forgoes the other female characters in the game, along with the stories that would inherently come from them seeing as they're *not* Link.

I have absolutely zero problem with playing as a girl in Zelda.  That would be backwards as all hell.  I only have a problem with warping established characters in ways that I find to be tacky and pandering.  I don't want to see male Lara Croft.  I don't want to see female Mario.  You can make new characters, or use existing ones.  I prefer characters to stay consistent.
