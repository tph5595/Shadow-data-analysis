45916,"Oof, I find this opinion so offensive that I want to downvote it, but I'm in an unpopular opinion thread, so I should really upvote it! I'm so torn right now."
46219,"Regarding number 2, the silent realm quests were some of the most fun and memorable parts of Skyward Sword! The Timer in Majora's Mask was central to the entire experience of the game, and the maze of OoT's Lost Woods was no less fun than an on-paper maze, which a lot of people enjoy.

It's really hard to objectively call something ""not fun."" One person's chore is another person's fun. With the exception of feeding the fish in WW, every other item you listed there is a unique, one-time experience, though, and I think *that's* a major strength of the series. Any given quest, whether you like it or not, is almost guaranteed to be a one-time thing. You complete it, and you move on. Whether you consider it an obstruction to fun or fun in and of itself, it was a unique experience, and now it's over."
46342,"Um, I think that is literally one of, if not *the* most popular criticisms of any Zelda game, ever."
46513,"While I do agree that TP improved on just about everything that OoT did, what makes OoT great isn't that it's objectively one of the best Zelda games, but rather that it executed the move from 2D to 3D incredibly well and revolutionized the entire genre. TP may have improved on OoT, but without OoT there would be no TP.

Link to the Past isn't part of my childhood (went Sega for the 16-bit era, unfortunately), so I don't really feel qualified to comment on your second unpopular opinion. I do like MM a lot, though."
83723,"Yeah, that's true. I just wanted to discuss your point."
101683,"I guess I'm using the term ""great"" to refer to its overall impact on the world. How fun it is to play is a big part of that, but how the game compared to other games of its time is also a big part. Twilight Princess might be more fun to play, but Ocarina of Time is still the ""greater"" game.

I don't think your opinion that TP improves on OoT is terribly unpopular, though--I mean, TP takes place in the same Hyrule, follows the same basic formula (three dungeons, Master Sword, bunch more dungeons), and even features the original Hero of Time as the mysterious skeletal teacher. They were definitely going for an improved OoT experience, and I don't think many people would fight you when you say that they succeeded."
151653,"No, but since this is an ""unpopular Zelda opinions"" thread, I'm not sure such a popular opinion belongs here, whether or not it's correct."
