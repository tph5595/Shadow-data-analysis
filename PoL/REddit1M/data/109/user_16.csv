37195,"Which game am I talking about?

  Wake up in small village, Gain a sword and shield somehow, oh no, something big and bad is causing problems!

  Oh no! Now I must go to a big town to find out information. I guess I will solve some problem by going to dungeon areas, most likely forest, fire, and water. 

  I did the thing. Now something BIGGER happened! I got to collect some other things to unlock the final area or final sword form where I face off against... a great evil that I have to use a special late game weapon to beat. 

  All the while each dungeon gets me a new item that I use to solve the second half of the dungeon and/or beat the final boss. 

  They're different, sure, but *drastically?* Probably not.

  But that's why it's an unpopular opinion thread, so good on you. "
