Then again, it's been a while since I played it, so yeah. My favorite zelda games are LttP and Majora's Mask, if you're curious."
57768,"Like I said in a reply I made for someone else, I can't even really think of what exactly makes me not like the game so much, I just really didn't enjoy the game for whatever reason. I guess I like the overworld better in Link to the Past (the main game I compare Link's Awakening to). Link's Awakening is more dungeon focused, where I like Zelda games with larger focus on the overworld and non-dungeon parts of the games (MM is my favorite zelda game)"
