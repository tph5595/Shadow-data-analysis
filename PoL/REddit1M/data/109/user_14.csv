34424,"The series went downhill after OoT.  I really don't care for the 3D versions of LoZ at all.. OoT was the first so Ill give it a pass.

49795,Those were good.  I just don't like the third person view.  
87567,"I actually love 3rd person games (GTA, AssCreed, Saints Row are some examples)   I just didn't like the way the Zelda series went with it.. it takes about an hour before you actually have control of your character due to all the hand holding.  They also don't feel as open world as the first few games did.   As for Metroid Prime.. I HATE the direction that series went.  I really don't like 1st person shooters at all.   Zelda:A LttP and Super Metroid are in my top 5 games of all time.  I was very disappointed with the follow-ups on both games. "
141137,I like the top down not third person.  Remember everyone.. I'm posting an unpopular opinion.
