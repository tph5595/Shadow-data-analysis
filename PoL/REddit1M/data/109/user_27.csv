45980,Someone recently did a survery about favourite Zelda games and out of ~4000 respondents 19% picked OoT and 22% picked WW so you're not alone.
46057,"Agreed, but in the sense that 3D Zelda combat is so terrible that Skyward Sword's combat is much better than it."
46211,"As someone who never had a NES and really didn't like the original Zelda the first time I played it as I was very anti-guide, when I did play it with a map I actually enjoyed myself a lot.

I think it creates a sensation that other Zelda games are sorely missing, which is to say some sense of threat. I don't think I died even once in ALBW."
46233,Well technically that's a fact.
46319,Are you including the Oracle games and Minish Cap in that?
49112,If they fix the healing system in BotW looks like it'll be really good. I hope they don't ruin it by making you have way too much health and healing to the point of no challenge.
87055,"Zelda games are bizarre in that they have these inverted difficulty curves where the hardest dungeon is probably the first one due to only having three hearts.

The NES games are really the only games where the enemies actually scale at the same pace as the gear you acquire. In all the later games once you have more hearts, or start getting bottles dying is basically off the table."
87109,Is this something strictly limited to Zelda or you not like 3rd person games in general? Did you ever play Metroid Prime?
94576,"Interesting. Like I agree that OoT is not a very faithful representation of the older 2D Zelda games, it is it's own thing. But I feel like Prime is a very faithful translation of 2D Metroid into 3D, but different strokes I guess."
169313,Surely skipping the boss containers and only collecting Heart Pieces would be the better way of doing it. Then again I have a terrible memory and I forget what each chest contains so I can't avoid them even if I wanted to.
