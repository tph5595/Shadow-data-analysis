26845,I've never thought that MM was a dark game. I've always found it to be humorous rather than dark. TP did a fat better job being a dark game 
6654262,"I completely agree. I spend more time going: ""ooooookay then"" than anything else. It's a great Zelda game and I enjoy it but I don't get the ""dark"" part of it. "
6654470,"Not really. Death is kind of portrayed in a childish and unauthentic way. It feels like an action movie like Die Hard where death SHOULD mean something but it doesn't. The ONLY part of the game that is dark in my opinion is Mikau's death. Even that is ruined by a ridiculous ""babies being stolen by pirates"" plot. Every dark aspect of this game is overshadowed by something so ridiculous it loses all meaning. 

This is a game with a hand coming out of a toilet asking for paper, aliens attacking a milk bar, and tingle. The atmosphere isn't dark, and the only feeling of doom is a timer, that literally means nothing after you get the ocarina of time. I just don't get it"
