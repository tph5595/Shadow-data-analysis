67755,"&gt;Ocarina of Time is obsoleted by Twilight Princess.

I mostly agree with that."
67819,"The N64 games are somewhat of a low point in the series.  Both games are overrated.  Especially Majora's Mask.  I can't even really be bothered to finish it (for the time being, anyways)."
68070,"There is only one Hero of Time and that is OoT/MM Link.  However, there are many other heros."
68250,"3D Zelda games might work better in first person, given how often they switch to first person to use items.  Idk.  Just a thought."
75456,My point is that not every Link is the Hero of Time.  Most are the heros of other things.
