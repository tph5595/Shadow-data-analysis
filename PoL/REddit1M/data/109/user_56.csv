102162,"I disagree. I thought the motion controls worked fine and I enjoyed them at first, but they did not add a puzzle component to enemies. It was just ""slash in the right direction"" every. Single. Time. Every enemy was the same exact thing because the only thing you needed to do to beat each one was slash in a certain direction - no timing, no creating openings, nothing. Every enemy felt the exact same, from a Bokoblin to Demise. I actually enjoy SS, but I can't really stand behind the combat. You don't control the sword, you control the direction of the swing, and that's it. Those are far from the same thing."
