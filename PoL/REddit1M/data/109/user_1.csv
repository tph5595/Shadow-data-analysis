4205,I like the zelda timeline.
141070,"I think it is, with all the people claiming that the timeline is bad and shouldn't exist/never existed."
219380,"Yeah, but the idea that it is the same story told over and over again but with different variables never held any water. Looking at the history of the zelda series, the major games always had some connections to each other."
