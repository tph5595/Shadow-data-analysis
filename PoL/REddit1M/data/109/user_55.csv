91856,"For me:

I love phantom hourglass, it is my favorite of the handheld games, and I don't mind the temple of the ocean king in the slightest.

I don't find A Link to the Past to be super amazing. I still see it as the base and standard to which all top down zelda games follow, iterating on it and improving.

We missed out on some more great looking sprite based games. I hope perhaps someday nintendo goes full retro and releases a new gameboy for super low cost gamers so we can see more sprite based games again."
