IIRC, it was under a platform, and you get that platform out of the way by raising the water level. Other than that, having to switch boots constantly was annoying, but I don't think that made the dungeon worse - you don't need to switch that much once you know what you're doing.

Jabu-Jabu's Belly in Oracle of Ages was *far* worse than OoT's Water Temple."
