74362,"I love skyward sword. The controls were never an issue and they added a new level of connectedness to the game that the others don't have.

I don't care much for majora's mask (although I do like it more now that when I first played it, it's probably my least favorite 3d game)

I don't think any of the companions are annoying.

I really liked spirit tracks, and think it deserves an hd/3d version with better graphics.

Finally, I wish people would stop going at each other's throats when they see a different opinion, I mean, with so many games in so many different styles and themes, there is absolutely going to be conflicting opinions. There are no objectively better games either.

(Sorry if I seem atop a high horse here, I'm not reacting to this specific thread, I just see a lot of fighting over here and I needed to get this off my chest)"
