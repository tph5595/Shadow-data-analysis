47467,"Guys, don't hurt me for this one... But I really really really didn't like Minish Cap. I found the overworld too restrictive which forced linearity. The first large-scale ""normal"" boss was neat but lost its uniqueness shortly after. The library book fetch quest isn't the longest of the Zelda fetch quests but it felt pointless since you stayed in the same area to complete it. And while I liked some of the items like the cane that turns things over, none of them felt really exciting or special to me.

*sigh* Okay, I'm ready. Commence backlash.

Edit: And to make up for lack of cutscenes, everyone talked SO much. I just wanted all the characters (titular cap no exception) to hush up and let me play/explore.

Edit #2: I picked up Tri-Force Heores and am a quarter of the way through the game on single player. I'm enjoying it and have no intention of playing multiplayer."
