59327,"A female Link, or even a game playing as Zelda, would be really cool.  
Although perhaps this opinion is ""on the fence"" rather than outright unpopular."
93347,"Yeah, no doubt some portion of the fanbase would crack the shits. I agree forcing the player to be Linkle would be a bit far, but I don't see what's wrong with providing the choice when you start a new file or whatevs. "
136966,"Yeah, like I'm not against the mandatory Linkle (or equivalent), I mean it's not like we're not already having a gender forced on the Hero of Time, but I can understand Nintendo's caution-- they're a business who needs to care about the community's response, even factoring in possible bigotry. :(  
You could choose gender in Pokèmon and I felt like it didnt take away from the game. "
202730,"Well, what does Link being male add to the series?"
239393,"Whilst I love the Zelda series, the character of Link is by far the dullest aspect; what does he do other than run around with a sword and sometimes have different facial expressions? But he gets away with it because, like all silent protagonists, he's a vehicle for the player to project themselves into the world.  
I would love to see the concept of Link get pushed a little harder, challenged and deconstructed. I would love to see the prevalence of male protagonists in video games get challenged and deconstructed. Why would a female Link be cool? For the same reason that any status quo being challenged in a competent manner would be cool: that's where innovation comes from.  
And since ""Link"" is a different incarnation of ""the Hero"" in every Zelda game (except for direct sequels), a gender swap wouldn't create any storyline inconsistencies too."

1. I’m not clear how having a female Hero-equivalent diminishes the role of the female secondary characters. Is the game only allowed to have x number of women? If there’s a chance to have a Zelda or Impa-controlled game, then great, do that as well. The notion that female characters are just “men with boobs on” is horrendously phallocentric.  
2. I feel like that's being needlessly sentimental about Link's role in the Zelda series; like, ""less defined and more of a malleable vessel that exists as a tool and not as a character"" is a good definition of Link to begin with. There’s a number of tropes about Link, certain facial features, golden hair, sleeping in and going “hyah!” when fighting, and I don’t see how any of this will disintegrate before our eyes just because it’s a woman. I understand what you mean by eroding elements of the character to the extent that we may as well be playing Skyrim, but avatars are defined by their customisability; at most, we are customising one aspect of the same character while retaining the core. A female version of Link already exists (Linkle) and yet Link as a character has not disappeared into nothingness. As I said to someone elsewhere in this thread, choosing your gender in Pokemon hasn't diminished the iconicity of Ash Ketchum.  
3. Tweaking an established idea is the centre point of making new stuff; art or whatever. Saying ""why gender swap when he's always been male"" is just being adverse to change. Why change anything, ever? Why don't they just release Ocarina of Time fifty more times? Because bold changes to the mythology (like Majora's Mask, for example), have the most to offer the evolution of the series. But when you change something you lose something, and your points are kind of echoing that mournful sentiment. But you also gain something, and whether that’s female gamers feeling they have some on-screen representation without relying on secondary characters, or general gamers wanting a revitalised interpretation of the Hero of Hyrule, or providing an opportunity to expand the Hero’s role into something more explorative, I think that change would be worth it and, thus, cool."
413210,"&gt;You could play as Zelda and experience her side of the adventure for once. You could play as Impa and see some of that secretive, underlying lore that always comes with the Sheikah. Or... you could play as Link again, except now a girl. Why? It's by far the least interesting of the options.  
  
Whilst I agree that a Zelda/Impa game would also be awesome, such a game will always be a spinoff because it’s dealing with secondary characters. I’m not talking about shunting female characters to second fiddle: I’m saying it would be cool if the central figure of the universe (Hero of Time/Winds/Whatever) was a woman. That’s not tacky. It’s interesting and subversive and would be an interesting step to take the story in a different direction. You know what’s not interesting? The central character being the same for every single game. I’m not half so bizarrely possessive of the bearer of the Triforce of Courage being blonde, green-hatted, male Link for every single game, forever. Would a female Hero change the Zelda series? Yes! Good! I’m afraid you’ll have to explain how that kind of shake-up to the series wouldn’t be a worthwhile contribution.  
  
&gt;And that isn't what I said, either. I said a female Link is a ""man with boobs"" - not any other character - because that's literally what it is. Is Link a boy? Yes. If you turn him into a girl, you've taken a boy and simply changed his physiology. You've taken a boy, and given him boobs.  
  
But a female Hero (please note “female Hero” rather than “female Link”) wouldn’t necessarily be the same character. And even if she did retain the Link tropes I mentioned previously, it is still more of worthwhile step than re-creating the same character time and again. If you’re not able to comprehend that women playing the game would derive some enjoyment from a female Hero, or dudes who think it would be a cool flavour to add, then I can only assume you’ve played nothing but games where the protagonist resembles you every time, and can’t see the value in a character resembling anyone else. An attitude for which I have very little respect, and even less patience.  
  
&gt;As for my second point, it has less do to with sentimentality and more to do with character definition. In the same way, I'd prefer Zelda to remain who she is, and for Link to retain his other features outside of gender. I wouldn't be fond of Link suddenly being a 7 foot tall bodybuilder - because change for the sake of it - either.  
  
But what change isn’t change for the sake of it?! Nintendo is all about exploration for exploration’s sake. They could’ve stuck with Gamecube controllers for every console hence, it was perfectly functional, but they decided to go with motion controls because: DIFFERENT! People’s preferences on that will differ (honestly, I probably would’ve been happier just with the GC controllers), but they would say, exploration is about the journey, not the destination. Going back to the original Zelda title, this was the lifeblood of the game, and the trademark of the series.  
And for the record, if you’ve played Majora’s Mask you’ll note that Link WAS specifically able to change into a 7-foot bodybuilder and it was awesome. But of course you wouldn’t like that, altering your precious Link into anything other than a bland cut-and-paste from the last game.  
Do you see where I’m going with this? You are clinging to an archetype like an aquaphobe clinging to the side of a pool.  
    
&gt;Linkle is not ""female Link"" though. She's a big fan of Link, who imitates him because she thinks he's cool as hell. She's only ""female Link"" in the way that a fan who dresses up as a character is an alternate gendered version of that character. She's basically a cosplayer, and beyond that, Hyrule Warriors isn't canon and doesn't really have any effect on the actual series.
  
What?! How on earth does her back story change anything? She was, quite clearly, specifically designed to be the “female Hero” equivalent who I’ve been describing this whole time. Who follows Link’s tropes, appearance, and even his name. Again, I’m having trouble following your logic with this; in spite of her obvious mirroring of all elements of Link, she’s doesn’t count as a “female Link” and actually contributes something, meanwhile any other female character who mirrors all elements of Link doesn’t contribute anything. That’s either completely inconsistent or the most tedious distinction I’ve ever encountered.
And, canon or not, she is now a part of the series just as Hyrule Warriors officially is.  
  
&gt;You don't play as Ash in the Pokemon games. You play as a much less distinct avatar named ""Red"" by default. There is no ""female Ash.""  
  
If I remember correctly, Ash was also a name that was an option when you choose at the start of the game. And so what about the name? You can choose Link’s name as well but he’s still otherwise known as Link.  
  
&gt;To improve it, and this doesn't ""improve"" anything by itself. Imo, you need a reason to change something. Change for the sake of change is often detrimental without a real point behind it. Change because you've thought of an idea that might improve something for the better/fun/more interesting is the way to go, and that's been the reason behind all new ideas in Zelda games. This change for example doesn't really improve or experiment with anything meaningful. It's just a change because ""Why not?"", and the answer is that there are various other better ways to handle the end result. You'd ""gain"" the same things by using an actual female character, and I'd have a lot more respect for a change like that which utilized these characters over just taking Link and altering his gender.  
  
Ahh, and here we have the most subjective of the whole discussion. And it’s hard to explain this without repeating myself, but most of this is just down to personal taste and opinion. I think a female Hero IS an improvement. Because female Heros are a cool thing that I like, that hasn’t been done in the series; and also I don’t think women should be shunted to secondary characters. It IS meaningful, because in an industry saturated with male protagonists, characters like Linkle offer a chance for women to have representations in the game they’re playing, and be CENTRAL to the universe they’re playing in, not just spinoffs. But don’t not make the spinoffs too; I’m totally up for The Legend of Impa.  
You’re welcome to have your own opinion on this. But, given your distaste for female or bodybuilder Links, even though I’ve demonstrated both have existed and were perfectly valid contributions to the series, forgive me for not trusting your instincts on this entirely.  
  
&gt;Representation is equal to the to demographic buying these games. Like I said, I like female leads, but the reason we see more male ones is because there are more males playing and buying the games.  
  
They’re male because more males play the game, or more males play the game because they’re male? And how is this not more of a reason to introduce female Hero’s? Male gamers can have more realistic, not-phallocentric game worlds, and women can feel a higher level of identification, possibly tapping into a greater demographic. That is a thing to be sought, not a reason to withhold it.  
  
&gt;You could have those things without changing his gender, and changing his gender wouldn't necessarily accomplish those things by itself. You could easily (and probably) end up with the exact same thing you've always had, except with higher-pitch grunts and a slightly different model. On the other hand, you could keep Link's gender and flesh out the things that make him who he is, achieving the same potential result you spoke of. The point is that Link's gender is barely relevant to that.  
  
How?! Someone’s gender is a big part of someone, if changing it for a popular character was so non-consequential then we wouldn’t have such an outcry whenever it’s suggested. And of course you could have these things without changing his gender; I’m not against those things either! Any of it! All of it! The fact that other y character aspect can be tweaked doesn’t make x character aspect now redundant. Overhaul everything! Nothing is sacred. That’s what art is.  
  
Christ. It’s late and I’m going to bed.
