47789,"I have two that I can think of from the top of my head. 

*Despite my love for both characters, I don't have basically any interest in LinkxZelda as an actual couple... At all.

*I like almost all of Link's companion/partner characters (including Navi and Fi) and I'm not a huge fan of him just travelling completely alone.  "
68494,"Exactly. 

I won't deny them dropping serious hints in skyward sword but almost every other Zelda game I just wasn't in to the idea of them being together which is ok. I love how they end up working together but I think the idea of every Zelda and Link being an item is ridiculous.  It's not that big a deal but people I know take the ship so seriously that they think I'm ""crazy"" for thinking this. I just don't see them as ""romantic soulmates"". Haha

To be fair. I'm not saying Navi or Fi are the best character's ever but I feel I didn't mind them as much as others. :)
In my option, Midna was a companion character done right. But that opinion is hardly unpopular. "
