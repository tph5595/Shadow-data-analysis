76745,I didn't realize this was unpopular!
76814,"I think OoT is a good template for Zelda titles, but isn't fun to play any more now that I've played ones that built off of it"
77123,"Yeah, it was like 99% retcon (I mean, like obviously MM follows OoT, but most things were retconned). I don't mind if they want to start constructing a timeline going forward though, I just don't believe they had this timeline planned all along"
78325,"Yeah I'm with you, I still don't think it feels very Zelda like, but I love this game save for a few short bullshit things that once you know, don't get in the way (like knowing to play the flute in front of the spider thing). I still find combat in this game very engaging and love having magic!"
78371,I think fans want this (or would mostly be cool with it) but the devs are afraid to do this
96422,"Yeah I don't want Linkle, but a female Link (like really, Link being male is only a superficial quality of these games) or playing as Zelda, would be cool. I'd love to play as both Link and Zelda in one playthrough and actually have them fight differently
