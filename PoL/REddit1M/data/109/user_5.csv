12855,"here are some:

1. i like spirit tracks. it had decent-enough sidequests and some sort of tough optional areas for the era it was in (surrounded by some of the most forgettable entries in the series).

2. i don't like the boomerang. i never really did like it. though it's pretty damn useful in the 2D games i still don't really like it. in the 3D games it's just a pain.

3. i like the whip/grappling hook series of items a lot. most people seem to not care, but i really enjoyed them. they can solve puzzles, allow you to indiana jones around, and can be used in combat as well to collect items and semi-stun the enemy.

4. i think the great bay temple is an excellently designed level."
