The wolf parts tho I don't enjoy. For me it goes A Link Between Worlds, Majora's Mask, OoT and then TP.  I should finally play wind waker after this one tho."

It was the first time I played them, even tho I've had an N64 since I was 6 (What a Christmas), and well I never had any Zeldas as kid don't know why. But I think it was a complex game, that was on the scary side and thus people as kids didn't like it as much or finish it."
