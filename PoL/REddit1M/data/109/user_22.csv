40705,My two favorite Zelda games are Skyward Sword and Link's Awakening.
57578,"Well it is the unpopular opinion thread. 

I've beaten all of them except for 2, wind waker, OoA, and the non-Nintendo ones (faces of evil, wand of gamalan, etc). 

Link's Awakening is just such an amazing fully realized Zelda title for the original Gameboy. I mean there are some great gameboy games I can attest to this because I'm subscriber and contributor to /r/gameboy but the aren't a whole lot of original gameboy games that are full game experiences. A lot of them were console lite experiences. Link's awakening had a lot more going on for it than the legend of Zelda and was an on-par experience with alttp. 

Skyward Sword, I just loved everything about it. The graphic style, the run mechanic, the sacred shield is absolutely beautiful, the less annoying sidekick of FI, the upgrading the mastersword, the revisiting dungeons you already explored, the boss battle with giant squid is one of my favorite boss battles in the series, the time displacement machines, some of the coolest items (beetle), the motion controllers actually working unlike Twilight Princess, the shear panic of collecting the tears and avoiding the guardians, the shadow of the colossus style boss fights with demise. Just so many wonderful things in that game. "
