131271,"I honestly love the Wind Waker even more than Ocarina of Time (even though I love that game too). To me, its one of the best Zelda games ever made; hell the sailing made it much more enjoyable as you didn't know what kind of Island you would end up on. But the main problem with it is the Triforce side quest (Fuck You Tingle!!!).

For me, my top 3 Zelda Games are:

1- The Wind Waker

2- Ocarina of Time 

3- A Link to the Past"

People hated twilight princess?"
