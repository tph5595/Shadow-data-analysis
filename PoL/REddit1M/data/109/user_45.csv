65930,"To your first point I really don't see why people keep coupling Link and Zelda together. I haven't played SS so that may factor in since I hear that there are heavy story elements in it. Still Link is always the simple farmer boy or similar while Zelda is royalty. Yes he saves Hyrule in his many incarnations but his role is always that of a servant or savior of Hyrule in general, it just so happens that Zelda being safe plays a key role in this as well.

Maybe it's because I'm so invested in LttP but I have the same issue wiht Mario and Peach/Toadstool. The romantic angle to all these things just feel so forced.

As for Navi and Fi, well as I didn't play SS I can only speak to Navi and damn I wanted so to crush that stupid fairy."
