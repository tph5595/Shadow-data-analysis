It might have been because I was using a walkthrough or maybe just because I was too young to appreciate it, but I played it again this summer and I absolutely loved it. The engine is heavily refined compared to the previous games and even to the Oracle games, the writing is great, the characters are memorable, and the music is outstanding. You should absolutely give it another chance."
