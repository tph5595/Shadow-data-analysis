0,"So, a while ago I posed the same question in /r/Mario , and I got some pretty interesting responses! So, I thought that I'd try this again with another popular Nintendo franchise.

What about you guys?"

62582,Agree! I was a little disappointed that a female link wasn't announced as playable I'm BOTW. It would have been a cool option to have.
