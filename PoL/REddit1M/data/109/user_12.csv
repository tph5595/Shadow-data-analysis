1. The original Zelda is devoid of fun.  It's a brutal, unforgiving slog that people like for nostalgic reasons, but it was improved upon in every possible way by Link to the Past.  Nobody finished LoZ without a guide a some point and if they said they did, they're lying.  

2. Zelda games frequently throw up obstructions to fun.  Having to purchase bait to feed the fish to get map information in Wind Waker was a chore and was in no way fun.  Skyward Sword, an exceptional game, was *filled* with mandatory garbage like the Scrapper escort quest, four Silent Realm trials, etc.  The timer in Majora's Mask (yes, even with the song), blind luck in finding heart pieces (Link to the Past digging and chest games, Ocarina of Time graveyard), the maze of the Lost Woods in Ocarina, none of those are fun to experience.  A lot of what you experience in Zelda games is fun the first time, but never fun again.  Maybe ""novel"" is a better description.

3. I desperately prefer 2D to 3D Zelda games.  I find the 3D games to be a bit overwhelming.  

I am a crabby person sometimes."

The entire basis for this thread is opinion, which by definition isn't objective."
