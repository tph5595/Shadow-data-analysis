55741,"I think Zelda SS is as good as MM, WW and TP, and for me OOT is a little bit behind, i really liked a lot Four Sword Adventure too, i played every Zelda or at least watched multiple playthrough ( like for Oracle of Age/Season that i didn't played, but i think that is the only one that i watched ) except the last one on 3DS and Zelda 2, and they are all so good imho, my favourite are the one quoted earlier

Edit : And i really like a lot the history of Zelda, the timeline and everything that isn't tell and philosophic theme and theory on that, like the Pandemonium theory of MM, i really think they have a way to tell things without word that is just sublime "
56556,"I would be interested to hear your point about it, even if it was drastically different than the other 2D Zelda it had his very own charm and i remember the character being lovely and tons of small reference among other game, i think the event where pretty cool too, and the dungeon had a clever design imho "
