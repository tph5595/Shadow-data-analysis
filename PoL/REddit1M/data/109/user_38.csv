53140,"I think Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks are EXTREMELY underrated.

Once you get used to the stylus controls, they are a load of fun and the stories are great.

They have solid stories, good boss battles, and the traveling mechanics aren't nearly as bad as people make them out to be.

They definitely deserve their place in the Zelda series.

Also, it doesn't hurt that the train music in Spirit Tracks is like crack. Amazingly catchy."
