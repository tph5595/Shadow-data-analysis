1614,"Yup. All of the Divine Beast quests have a similar structure, but the Rito one is the easiest in every single regard. The archery part is incredibly easy, the new hero (the silver Rito) has about five lines, attacking the Divine Beast is cool as hell but still easier than the other three, the dungeon takes all of fifteen minutes to complete and the boss is much easier and more predictable than the others. 

Kass does redeem the Rito somewhat, however. And I actually really enjoyed Revali too."
5192,As long as we can agree that Thunderblight is the hardest. 
5911,"I figured it out easily enough, but I was bloody hard to actually do it. You have literally less than a second to grab one of those poles and move out of the way."
6104,"Yeah, that's true... the other three races are all directly threatened by the Beasts (sandstorms, eruptions, rainfall). The Rito are just like ""there's this thing in the sky, weird""."
7605,His speed completely fucked me over. I'd already eaten half of the meals in my bag before I realised that all you had to do was hold your shield up...
19864,"I never really got those vibes, they just seemed to imply that they only couldn't fly near the beast. As long as they stay low they should be alright. "
21014,"Ooh yeah, that'd be a good feature. If you glide within the bird's range it zaps your ass to death. "
23037,Or loads of flying guardians until you beat the boss. 
23400,"You messing? The Gerudo town is arguably the hardest to access (because elixirs won't work), the Yiga hideout is the most difficult pre-beast section (if you know to avoid the Lynel at Zora's Domain), it's the hardest Divine Beast to attack, the hardest dungeon and the hardest boss.

I know this is all personal opinion but it seems pretty widespread. The *entire* Rito section - from arriving in the village to beating the boss - took me less than an hour. Gerudo took me a few days, probably 5+ hours in total. "
24458,Hadn't done that yet. I used bombs for so long before I realised that they're shit and Stasis is amazing.
24554,Yeah. I did find it funny how you can just go outside and he just sits in there looking at you though. 
30992,"Avoiding the Yiga is definitely harder than avoiding the Lynel, but in combat it's no contest. The Yiga are piss easy to beat."
32353,Yep. It took me longer to find just one terminal in the Gerudo beast than it did for me to complete the entire Goron and Rito dungeons. 
32488,"You're supposed to use bananas to distract them. 

It wasn't too hard, but I'm saying that it's harder than the other pre-beast sections: collecting thunder arrows for the Zoras, popping balloons for the Rito and finding the Goron kid."
32533,"At that point, I suppose so. I only got caught once, right at the start."
32675,"Yeah, must've taken me an hour too. That's one of the hardest 3D Zelda dungeons in can recall, it's definitely this game's Water Temple. "
34372,Just throw bananas at 'em.
35654,"Even with the Master Sword, he's fast as hell and the magnesis section should still be the same. I ate a *lot* of food battling that asshole. "
39343,Getting one-shot from all over the place and their enormous amount of health?
39361,Accordions are fucking cool.
50056,I didn't touch any of them. You only need to distract about three of 'em.
50276,"The Yiga don't really make sense, do they. They're on top alert whilst you're in their hideout but when you're outside having the loudest battle ever with their noisy leader they apparently don't hear you. Also they can seemingly track Link to anywhere in Hyrule... except their own hideout. "
