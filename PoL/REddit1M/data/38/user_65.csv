I knew how to beat him, because I had already done it once when I went to the castle (failed miserably fighting calamity Ganon though) and even knowing that I had to lift the metal pole things to use them against him, I couldn't get close enough to actually do it. He was flying around in place where I couldn't get the pole to reach him. Such a BS fight."
