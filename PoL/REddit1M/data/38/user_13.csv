113954,"I am most certainly not messing. All the blights are laughably easy, even thunderblight. You just perfect dodge and its dead. I completed the entire gerudo section, in about 2-3 hours. All shrines, great fairy, and the thunder helm, as well as both pairs of boots and all the armor. Getting in the beast was easy, I didn't even need the help of Riju or whatever her name was. A few easy shots and it was down. The beast itself was difficult at first, but I figured it out in about 10 minutes then flew through it. Whereas rito, the puzzle took me longer, and the quests/shrines took FAR longer to find and complete. Maybe cause there was just more to do, and I liked to take my time because of the music, but hey. Who knows?? "
