26063,"Wut ?  
the gorons are the fucking best, what are you smoking ?  
Gorons are just giant cuddly bros.   
And this time they wear little hard-hats, do you even realize how cute that is ?  "
37333,"Mostly the fact that it failed to deliver on almost all major aspects of a Zelda game for me.    

I will honestly admit that I probably was getting too excited with possibilities on how great this game was gonna be.  
I genuinly thought this was gonna be the game to rival or even de-throne my favorite Zelda.  
Then it just turned out it decided to de-*throne* my least favorite of the 3D Zeldas instead.      
Well I guess that one is happy to no longer be on that spot atleast.    "
38256,"For me it is essentially missing all the key elements, and the ones they ""expanded"" on are neat, but not as relevant, and if we assume this game is trying to ""bring them into the series"" then they probably should have focused on one at a time and actually got the most out of them straight away."
100579,"Having strong character moments, having unique dungeons with different puzzles and themes, having areas with meaningfull exploration, Memorable events and battles, strong musical score.    
And having more returning quirky side-characters, or new ones that feel like they would do well to become staples in the series, wouldn't hurt either.  '

Those are the main one elements of the Zelda series by now imo."
102332,"&gt;Character movements  

Not what I said... ... 

&gt;
It was short on dungeons, but the last few dungeons that had actual puzzles were 2D ones.  

Maybe cause the last Zelda game before BotW was a 2D Zelda ... ?  
And I'd say ""short"" is still being generous, I'd frankly say BotW has only a single actual dungeon, being Hyrule Castle.  
Everything else only reaches the value of ""mini-dungeon"" imo.  



&gt;
I thought the events were memorable, what constitutes as memorable to you?  

Being memorable makes it memorable, like, not sure how you would describe this  
Stuff like Midna dying on your back, Linebeck being taken over by Bellum, Groose firing you on top of Demise, Being launched into the Forsakken fortress in a barrel, clinging onto Morpheel or Argarock and stabbing their eye out.  

&gt;
I really enjoyed the music in the game, I really like how each area has its own music.  
 
Many areas do not actually have music of their own actually.    
And personalyl I found the music very lacking, what there is is decent, but many of the best songs are very few and far inbetween and do not play on the moments where the game requires them.

&gt;
I'm not sure I'm following on returning characters... Usually it's just Link and Zelda who are recurring, 

Not at all.  
There are easily over 50 characters in the series that reoccur across multiple games.  

And having a misspelled island with nothing of interest on it doesn't count for anything in that aspect imo.  
Named locations are neat, but they don't count as full appearances.  

.

Also, BotW has 2 returning side characters.  
Being Beedle and the Potion Shop doctor (now the Dye-guy in Hateno)  "
104532,"&gt; But from what I'm reading of the tone of your post, it sounds like you really enjoy the cinematic moments. I think one of the inherent problems with exploration based games is that it's not very cinematic.

They can be just the same, it is just that open world games fail to deliver in those aspects, but there is no reason why BotW couldn't have had those moments all the same.  

that is the real big issue I have with BotW.  
it had everything set up to be an open world game without losing those aspects of Zelda, but it failed at that, instead it just ended up being an Open World game with a Zelda skin on it.  

&gt;They cut a lot of what 'modern' Zelda is, and I'm glad for it honestly.  

this will probably sound elitist/assholish but whatever, what else is new with my comments and I don't know how to word it differently....  
But : Then maybe, JUST MAYBE, that means you weren't actually a fan of the zelda series anymore.    
When the main aspects of the series are boring to you and you need the series to essentially ignore them and turn into the current ""in"" genre to be trully interested in it again, that doesn't sound like that series is actually for you then.  

Like, I personally think Xenoblade's gameplay would be better as either a full on turn based rpg or more of an action adventure instead of the ""single player MMO"" it goes for now.  
But if that series changed to be like that, as well as dropping the other aspects relevant to the different genres, then it wouldn't actually be gameplay befitting that series really.  

.

BotW for me is like I'd imagine Metal Gear Solid V was for the fans that found that game lacking.  
it turned the series into an open world and lots of (new) people loved it.  
But many of the actual long-term fans of the series that stuck with the series the entire time didn't like how it tossed so many of the aspects the series was known for, or atleast weakened them down."
105085,"I don't get this reasoning at all personally.  
""themepark"", why?  
Cause it is linear ?  
you do realize that going to disney world is more like an open world right ?  
you see something and you can go there?  
Last i checked you aren't forced to go on Ride 1 before you can move along to Ride 2.  

Though I guess saying BotW is a themepark would be ungair as well, since it has no actual ""rides"" to go on, that's the big difference really.  
BotW isn't a themepark cause by the time you reach that ""ride"" you spotted you already saw everything there is to see and there is nothing of actual interest in that ruined town you noticed.  
Or in the next, or the next, or the next.... etc...

""oh wow, Forgotten Temple, that must be a sweet *ride*""    
""oh, it's just a plaza with nothing of actual interest there""  

""Oh man,""Akala Citadel, can't wait to get inside !""  
""oh nvm, it is just shape in a mountain you can't actually enter and explore""  

""Look at the dragon *floats* !""  
""please do not try to interact with the floats, just throw you *coupon* and you will get your random *prize*""  "
105464,"Oh I have seen it many times, and it is filled to the brim with patented Arin Handsome bullshit.  

(also, how does that make sense to the analogy ?  I've never been to a theme park where they actually ""hold your hand"" or coax you into an order of events, they just give you a map and say : go ride some rides and eat some horribly overpriced junkfood )"
150374,"&gt;and it's just my personal preference to dislike Zelda games that are like that. 

so then until BotW existed, you essentially disliked close to eveery single Zelda game?  
Pretty much only half-disliking TFH then and that's it ?  

So then, if you never actually liked Zelda, then is it ""normal"" that BotW was made *for you*, as opposed to being designed with the people that have liked the series for over two decades ?  

Also, there is little ""natural"" about having a world with no caves, every single big building is conveniatly destroyed in such a way that you can't enter it and just ingeneral being devoid of stuff to *actually explore*

&gt;but that doesn't change the fact that it's a crafted experience and that everyone who plays will experience the same thing  

This is honestly the most weird thing to me...  
who cares if you have the same experience as Joe or Jack ?  
If the experience is awesome, then what does it fucking matter if other people having it too ?  
This is honestly baffling to me that people for some reason can't enjoy an experience unless they know it is ""unique"" to them 

Do you not enjoy a movie unless you are the only person to see that version ?  
Does a story need to have a different ending for every reader ?

Never? Haha. I grew up playing Zelda, Link, A Link to the Past, and Ocarina of time. And I really enjoyed Majora's Mask and Wind Waker.  

Yet ever since LttP there has been an order to the games and you have been taken to themepark rides, with at most being able to change the order of a handfull of things.  

&gt;
Zelda was about having your own personal adventure within the game, then they decided to stick to a formula and it was less about personal adventure with your own stories and more about the game's stories.
I'm not saying that's inherently bad, I enjoyed some of those games. But once Twilight Princess hit, it became clear to me that the game was no longer about personal experiences and I stopped playing.  

An then more games in the series were about that then there were EVER ones with ""personal experience""

Newsflash : MM, WW, OoT and LttP are essentially as much a ""crafted shared experience"" as SS and TP"
204582,"Yet you say ""Zelda was about having your own personal adventure "" later on.   
So do you only mean the very first game then (I took it as implying the series was about that in your view) ?  
Because even II already (hell even I tbh) set the pace towards having an order build into it, and any sense of non-order was merely a result of the limitations of the age and allowing for sequence breaking here and there.   
But in the end, even with sequence breaking, all that changed was the order in which you took your little ""rides""    

&gt; Surely you can pick whichever ride you want to go on, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a crafted experience and that everyone who plays will experience the same thing.   

This is true just as much for all those zelda games you say you enjoyed as it is for the ones you didn't.  

Every single player is fired into the forsakken fortress by a barrel, every single player is pikced up by the helmaroc king, every single person fails to deliver the silver gauntlets to nabooru.  

Even in BotW, the big moments are still ""scripted""  
You can't decide to fire lightning arrows at Vah Ruta from the shoreline, or stand next to its orbs with the thunderhelm on during a thunerstorm.  

All that changed is that the puzzles are simplified intoonly looking at whether X goes into Y and that inbetween the (very lacking) story sequences/events, you can piss around and kill enemy camps in any order you like."
