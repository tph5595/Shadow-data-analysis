18935,"same here, was running around helpless trying to figure out what to do with the poles. i once even used the magnesis, and apparently i was too stupid to realize that i can use it on the poles... so i kept running, and had no clue on what to do anymore... 

i dont even know what happend that i figured it out... i think urbosa says an even bigger hint after a while,... but after i noticed that they are magnetic, it got way easier. i just suck at dodging and parrying, so i had to use every weapon to break his shield :D"
