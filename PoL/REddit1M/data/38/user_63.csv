83508,"Vah Medoh is probably my least favorite Beast, if only because it's laughably easy compared to all of the others, and I did it third in my play-through so I already had more difficult Beasts under my belt. The whole Rito arc in general is pretty bland. There's not much of a story like there is anywhere else. It's just... go find Teba and help him out. There's no shock arrows, no cannons, no Thunder Helm. It just feels plain compared to the others.

I feel like I'm in the minority, though, when I say I *loved* Revali. It's not often you get an ally in a Zelda game that has a serious attitude problem. Everyone always seems so positive. He was an ironic breath of fresh air. But I'm a condescending prick myself, so I guess we have that in common. "

Finally someone agrees with me!! You and me both, man. Revali is... such an ass, and yet I can't help but love him. "
