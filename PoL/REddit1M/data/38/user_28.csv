32386,Pillar? What pillar did you even have to climb? 
32447,"Pshh whatever Teba is the best. And I liked Revali better than Mipha, he was an asshole, but he at least had a good voice actor and a strong personality. "
33592,Oh I climbed up there for fun. I imagine the climb would be so much easier now that I have the full climber's outfit. 
43350,Which piece are you missing? And I say don't waste an arrow on it. I believe in you. If you're talking about the Major Test of Strength just use Stasis+ and get some whacks in. 
44920,Do you have any of the other test of strengths unlocked? The Modest test of strength just a stone's throw from there gives some guardian weapons which do decent damage. Otherwise Moblin clubs or dragonbone clubs are good for really smacking them. I'd bring about 3 of whatever weapon as you'll probably break 1-2. 
46466,"Yeah find a rhythm, for example: 1-2 arrows as he first appears, then stasis as he gets closer, smack him good, then run away. He'll start shooting at you or swinging, use your thunder rod to freeze him for another few seconds while stasis is recharging. Repeat the whole thing. Also regular arrows to their eyes do okay damage and stun them for a second or two.  "
51864,"I haven't experimented enough to know the damage range across the board. Regular should be fine, shock arrows work nicely too, but since you have the spear and rod I think you'll be fine. Also freezing them is fun too."
66937,"Good luck! And remember, the key is stasis! Don't get overwhelmed. "
124065,How'd it go?
