0,"I was freaking stoked when I found out the Rito were in this game. One of my fav races, so I saved that section for later in the game. So I get there and I'm pretty underwhelmed by their village but I get over it. I start the Champion quest part of it, get to the archery thing, beat that and... Wow that was it? That's all it took to get to the Divine beast? I honestly feel like I missed something somehow, it took me 15 minutes or so to get to the Divine beast from initiating that part.

Also Revali is such a bunghole...

Literally my favorite game ever otherwise. Can NOT wait for the DLC."
