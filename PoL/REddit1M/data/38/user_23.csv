30055,Just in case you run out? Seems like you're trying to make a problem out of a non-problem.
30320,Seems like you were just doing everything the hard way. You could get anti-fire elixirs at the stable before entering death mountain. You could then buy fire resistant armor in Goron city.
30951,"Eh, doesn't matter either way. That was less about introducing you to shock arrows and more about introducing you to a new formidable enemy: the Lynel. That's the reason I gave it a pass. If I had to do that for each and every Divine Beast though? I'd get pretty pissed off at the tedium."
52948,"Hard to make? You can buy a set of three at the stable before Death Mountain for around 100 rupees or so. They each last about a little more than a single trip up to Goron City, and then you could just buy the armor. There's even a guy a little ways before the city that'll give you an armor piece just for catching 10 fire lizards."
72255,Adding -ish to the end didn't change anything...
