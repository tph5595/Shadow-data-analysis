98300,What do you identify as key elements
101146,"Character movements, like animations?

It was short on dungeons, but the last few dungeons that had actual puzzles were 2D ones.

I thought the events were memorable, what constitutes as memorable to you?

I really enjoyed the music in the game, I really like how each area has its own music.

I'm not sure I'm following on returning characters... Usually it's just Link and Zelda who are recurring, but this also has Impacted and if I'm not mistaken Beedle looks really familiar too. Otherwise I think Tingle is missing, but he does have an island names for him, and many of the Ocarina of time characters have map locations named for them.

But from what I'm reading of the tone of your post, it sounds like you really enjoy the cinematic moments. I think one of the inherent problems with exploration based games is that it's not very cinematic. I think of Breath of the Wild as a return to form, a return to exploration based gameplay where combat and story work together to assist in the player exploring the world. So I can see why you're upset. They cut a lot of what 'modern' Zelda is, and I'm glad for it honestly. If they hadn't have done this, the last console Zelda game I'd have enjoyed would have been Wind Waker. The formula was so stale by the time Twilight Princess hit, that if it were bread, even the homeless wouldn't eat it.

Would the game have benefitted from longer dungeons? Absolutely. 

But I think recurring characters only serves to provide familiarity in a game where you should be unfamiliar with your surroundings. 

It's always sad when a game in a franchise you love misses the mark in your eyes, I hope you can still see the value in it - as this Zelda has been so successful they probably won't return to the Disney Land Cinematic feel again for a long time."
104705,"Yeah, I basically moved on once I realized Twilight Princess was a theme park. But then A Link Between World's was touted as different, and Breath of the Wild advertised wild horses and I realized they were serious about ditching the formula."
105419,"Because the game holds your hand through the experience. 

If you haven't seen Sequelitis, I really recommend it. https://youtu.be/XOC3vixnj_0"
131073,"The world exists for you, the player as opposed to just existing as a natural world. Surely you can pick whichever ride you want to go on, but that doesn't change the fact that it's a crafted experience and that everyone who plays will experience the same thing. Where with Breath of the Wild, as soon as they let you into the world without expectation, your experience becomes your own. Which of the divine beasts do you take on first, what resources will you use to overcome it, and how will you solve the puzzles and fight the boss?  Where with previous games, everyone beats the boss by stunning it three times with the item found in the dungeon. 

In a theme park, if you decide you don't want to wear your seatbelt for a ride, the ride doesn't go. If you decide you're going to grip the back of the cart, it doesn't go. The whole experience requires you sit in the same cart and buckle your seatbelt just like everyone else or you might have an experience different from other people which isn't approved by the park executives.

It's the difference between living a drama and watching a drama almost. And sure, it's definitely fine to have experiences crafted that way for you, but it takes a lot of interactivity and thought out of the equation. and it's just my personal preference to dislike Zelda games that are like that. "
171971,"Never? Haha. I grew up playing Zelda, Link, A Link to the Past, and Ocarina of time. And I really enjoyed Majora's Mask and Wind Waker. 

&gt;Was it normal that BoW was made with weclock in mind?

Yeah, because as I said, I've been playing the games since they came out. I even have the Nintendo Seal of Quality tattooed on my ass.

&gt;Crafted experience

Zelda was about having your own personal adventure within the game, then they decided to stick to a formula and it was less about personal adventure with your own stories and more about the game's stories.

I'm not saying that's inherently bad, I enjoyed some of those games. But once Twilight Princess hit, it became clear to me that the game was no longer about personal experiences and I stopped playing."

I said as much in my last post. Thanks."
209885,You seem really mad about this whole thing.
214900,"I feel I've appropriately gone over my points, surely BoW isn't completely a return to form and it isn't completely the previous formula either, the important thing about it is that it shakes it up. That's what really has me into it. And I never said I was completely against the formula, just that I had gotten tired of it. The language you're using has a lot of ""you said!"" Which feels more accusatory, so yeah it kind of feels like you're going off the rails just repeating what I said without seeing that I've said multiple times that the games have had a lot of change since ALttP."
