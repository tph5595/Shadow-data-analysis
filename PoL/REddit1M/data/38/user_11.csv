19771,The Rito are threatened because they can't fly anywhere. They're stuck on the ground like those peasant Gorons or Hylians.

The other storylines actively affect your ability to progress, Goron's have flaming rocks falling from the sky, Zora you can't climb, Gerudo has sandstorms but if the Rito's Divine Beast actually stopped you gliding around you'd realise their issue."
