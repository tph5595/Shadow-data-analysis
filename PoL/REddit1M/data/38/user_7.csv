17355,"Heh, I just did that section. The first of the beasts for me. Thought it was an amazing part, especially when flying around the beast to take it down. One of the most badass moments of Zelda for me. Anyway, I'm now on my way to the second beast, the Zora one (if I can find it, lol). 

But you're saying the other beasts are even more awesome? I can't wait now, dang. If only this workday would be over now..."
23075,"Hehe, guess I'm lucky then. When my girlfriend and I first set eye on the land of Hyrule in this game, we instantly set a goal to board that ""drone"" which you could see from pretty much anywhere on the map. So that's how I ended up there. Also, the ability you get from the bird people is insanely useful. I hope the others are just as useful, but I'd doubt it. No idea what they are, too. So no spoilers please ;-)

24800,"Yes, I did! But I didn't have the quest open, so I never knew I was going to a divine beast."
29013,"It is! But, I'll have to be honest in saying that you do figure out what you're dealing with halfway through. I mean; there's a huge ass drone flying about, with the entire village beneath it talking about it, and, especially the cutscene you get when entering the village.

From the start I did think it'd be something you'd go to during the story, but I didn't know it was something you could start whenever you wanted to."
