27299,"I was more let down by how I was climbing the pillar in the centre and missed the final jump to the top by an inch... Luckily I got the korok balloon, not sure if there was anything else at the peak"
32962,"Not pillar, but the stone... thing... that the village is wrapped around. You easily see the flat top of it during the Medoh entrance quest. I just started climbing, eventually finding a korok balloon and kept going to see if there's something at the top

66789,thanks! I'll try it out
159355,"Wasn't planning on it till I saw it. Went well, took a rough hit (forgot to change armor, ugh). Used stasis as suggested, broke a giant claymore (i think) and royal broadsword. Used thunder arrows when stasis was on cooldown and blizz rod once or twice... Got lucky landing 3 flurries"
