33581,"I turned them all off except for Gale. Lightning is so OP and makes it difficult to use lvl 2 or 3 charge attacks, Daruk's Protection messes up parry timings, and Mipha's Protection can make combat too easy. Gale is an incredibly useful travel tool (screw you, rain!) and allows bullet-time activation whenever you can't otherwise (rain, no grass to burn)."

With it, you can just guess and you either get it or Daruk covers you if you don't. It doesn't literally mess up the timing, it just makes you worse at it. It's great, but I prefer getting it on my own."

(Champion abilities really make that fight a whole lot easier. I'm working on beating it sans abilities)"
