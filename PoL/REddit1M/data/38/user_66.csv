135391,"So my backstory is 90+hrs and I've only done Gorons first and today the Rito. (If you want stats then its like 80 shrines, 341 korok seeds etc etc.)

I was worried about the Rito based on what plenty of people have said all around. I really wanted to save my favourite race for last but if the others were better then I didn't want them to suck.

Now I agree with the complaints, they were short changed in terms of content. Teba barely got any screen time and the Flight place was ridiculously easy. 

That being said my feelings think otherwise. For what it was, a super condensed storyline, I think it was fantastic. Sure I would have loved more, but what I got was brilliant.

- Beautiful rendition of Dragon Roost Island
- The town, holy crap living IN BIRD CAGES?! I loved it
- Pretty spectacular action sequence to enter the beast
- Watching the wings tilt as you try to reach the tips
- dope landing sequence
- dope power (though I wish i could use it 3 times before it recharged)
- Boss wasn't hard but I really liked the look and his 'second half ability' 

I guess I was somewhat flagging since I've played so much before reaching it, so you could say that being so deprived of story meant that this would naturally be awesome. But I don't think that is it, I got a cool action film basically and I can't complain.

If your wondering why I rate this over the Gorons well I guess its just they were a bit simple. I mean I loved the whole miner gig but I don't think it carried over enough to the actual city. I did like shooting beast and making it past the drones but just not as much as bombing a mechanical birdplane"
