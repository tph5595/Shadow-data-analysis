Revali is my favorite character in this game. I SAID IT AND I FEEL NO SHAME ABOUT IT EITHER. He's a dick but that's part of his charm - at least, for me. Obviously you don't have to agree! Also, the music inside Medoh once you activate the first terminal is incredible. It just feels...very sad. Reminiscent of flying, it has that grand sweeping undertone to it, but at the same time, there's no freedom. You're soaring in the air but you're trapped there, and I think it comes across loud and clear in that track. (I HAVE A LOT OF FEELINGS, OK.)

And like, dude, I'm terrified of heights so there were a couple moments where my hands were sweating up a storm but that wasn't enough to diminish it for me. "

And then you get the horribly sad music on Medoh and - yeah, he's all pomp and bluster and sure, he's a jackass to Link but there's a lot more to him than just that, you know? I love my birb. ;; "
