3452,"I'll agree of the four it might be the least interesting. However hanging out in the village was neat, I didnt expect a whole lot considering this would be whatever timelines first appearance of Rito, they wouldnt have Wind Waker as backstory, and the Zora kinda take their history away.

However the fact that the Goron place is on effing fire all the time, and some Gorons are just huge douchebags (the climbing shrine brothers and the blacksmith mainly) I hated that place just enough the Rito was a great experience in comparison "

I'm exaggerating a bit, but the combination of the amount of a-holes and the damn fire made me dislike that section the most. I love the snowy and dry areas, heat in the desert's fine, but bursting into flames sucked too much"
32433,"I was doing that, but that's what irritated me, I hate being forced to maintain these stupid hard-ish to make elixers, or wear this dumb looking and loud clunky armor, the other temperatures have multiple armor pieces I can wear to prevent it including two circlets that are almost invisible so I can still wear what I want. Or I can make multiple meals OR elixers to counter it, I'm not locked to one thing

It is just a huge pain in the ass for a mechanic that's cool the first couple of minutes"
