19433,"The guardian shields will just flat reflect them and take a little durability hit (no timing needed), but you can obviously deflect them (hit a while blocking) to mitigate the durability loss.

Easiest way to kill a guardian by far. Just z-lock and hold up your guardian shield while it blows itself up."
21242,You can just purchase guardian weapons from a certain vendor in the game with ancient parts and rupees.
21383,Careful when parrying really far away ones though... the beam isn't instant and has a travel time so you need to adjust accordingly :)

25690,You're in for a very ranged treat then ðŸ˜€
41684,You might need one of the more powerful ones... I have no problems bouncing them without hitting deflect with the ancient one from the vendor or the one from the trail of strength. The lowest level one might just not have enough durability to eat the blast.
