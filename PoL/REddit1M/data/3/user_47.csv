15360,"If you figure out the timing for parries, then yes. Usually what I do is Z-target them, wait for the red aiming laser to disappear, and then as soon as I see the blue laser appear in their eye I hit A to parry with my shield. If you get the timing down, every single time you'll be sending their laser back at them. Mobile guardians take 3 parries, sunken/immobile ones take only 1. If you don't get the timing right, you either die a fiery death (if you parried too early) or your shield breaks and you take no damage (if you parried too late/not at all)

Personally, it's worth it for me, because [SPOILER](/spoiler ""Once you get the Camera rune, you can upgrade your other runes using parts from the guardians and one in particular requires a rather rare material that I've personally only found from killing guardians"")"
24796,That's a really good point hah. I just usually get close to them since the mobile ones run up to you anyways. 
25535,"Nope, I'm waiting to do it when the story calls for it. The option to go there at any time is amazing but I've always been one who wants to play games the way they're ""supposed to be played"", at least the first time. "
