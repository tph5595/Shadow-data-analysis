0,
148,"84 Shrines completed (bit less in the clip I believe)

You can boost your stamina with some elixirs by a significant amount too but none was used in this gif (the circles would be yellow and to the left of the main one)"
561,"Ya, and +4 hearts from main dungeons obviously :)"
755,"Guardian Battleaxe++

Can be found in any ""A Major Test of Strength"" shrine given you can beat the miniboss."
1519,You can also Shield Bash the lasers which is really satisfying 
1766,Yeah 3 wheels is cap stamina (10 upgrades/40 shrines)
1954,"Yes

If you mistime it your shield is 100% gone though "
2317,I went full hearts for most of the main quest clearing and respecced into full stamina now that I'm going for World Map completion and always climbing stupid cliffs haha
2391,"It's okay, but an un-upgraded Ancient Set will not let you facetank those Guardians. If you have to choose, high defence is gonna be better most of the time."
2568,"Similar to any other Guardian weapon, nothing spectacular."
2852,"My Ancient Set is +4/+4/+2 so it's basically no damage, but you need a ton of mats to get that done. "
3116,Less of a waste on weapon durability too
3384,You can hybrid set too if you can reach higher upgrades that way +3/+3/+3 soldier/ancient mix would be better than +3/+2/+2 Ancient only
3416,"You can make ""accessories"" like earnings and shit, but they take up a helmet slot so I've just been selling them."
3422,"~~After Blood Moons yeah~~

edit: Read it wrong, nvm nope"
4522,You can't run into them with a giant horse if they fly :\^)
6214,"No, it's the armor you buy from Robbie for 2k rupees a piece and a ton of Ancient mats"
6236,B
6634,"Yeah, I think this is a lot of people's experience and honestly makes it so much more rewarding when you can finally do this to them"
7228,"If you're geared just wail at them, if you're not you gotta parry and lure them into pillars."
7503,"Enjoy the 20 minute ""bring the blue fire through this path of mobs"" quest to get him to do anything though haha"
8704,Gerudo City
8743,That sword drops off certain mobs in the open world though so you can always get more
8812,"How much defense is that? The Ancient set is kinda too valuable, getting durability up on like half your weapon drops is incredibly useful."
9444,Oh that's really good actually!
11000,I see you haven't climbed the Central Hyrule watchtower yet 
12941,"Yes, it's capped in the gif"
13577,"Did a gigantic streaming session over the weekend, the game is incredible

I'm maybe 50-55 hours in at this point"
13667,"Possible, yes. Worth it, no."
16366,Most of them are in shrines with common themes.
16490,Just wait until [the stealth section in Gerudo Dessert](/spoiler) especially if you're undergeared.
17402,"Well I always considered myself an ""efficient"" gamer. This game kinda forces you to rethink how to approach 100% though, since there's SOOO much stuff to be found in random places. I'm only getting to that now."
17582,Should I make a gif of destroying one of those to make you feel better? :)
18214,"I always forget about horses fuuuuuuuuuck

I also didn't have a torch so I was using moblin axes and sticks and was leapfrogging the fire from torch to torch. Got to the end and the Guardian killed me and I had to redo it lmao.."
18620,The real challenge is finding those damn koroks ;-;
18710,I did [Gerudo](/spoiler) first so I had like 5 hearts and unupgraded Soldier armor. Those 600 HP dudes would 1 shot me whenever they spotted me
18938,"Ice Arrows, that's really clever."
19580,TIL
20426,"You can just Glider Cancel and really easily dodge guardian lasers in the air, on the ground it's tougher.

Yeah this game is amazing."
22218,"Indeed, but it's incredibly stressful"
23167,Useful tip: when your stamina runs out you can press X 1 last time to reopen your glider for a half second and save yourself from fall damage.
24111,"Yeah it's the reward from the Gerudo dungeon, which releases a huge lightning burst when you release a charge attack.

You don't see it here because I cancel it with B right before it would've casted. 

It does an incredible amount of damage in a huge sphere, but the cooldown is something like 10 minutes for 3 charges."
25784,Thankfully didn't
25981,"That explains the fear then, hahaha"
33600,"Been running through Hyrule Castle whenever I'm bored. Main limiter is small cores to go from +2 to +3. 

Flying Guardians tend to have the most loot"
33718,"84 now, maybe 72 in the gif?"
43623,60ish hours
92823,Is this some secret area? Dont think I've found it
93556,"Shiet, I'm missing so much content still.

My map completion is only at 20% apparently"
