16440,"Spoilers if you care about the locations of these things. Bandana is under the Twin Peaks, I think it's the shrine there, but could have been a random chest and/or guarded by Bokoblins. 

Chest is obtained from Major Test of Strength, near Modest Test of Strength on the east coast, and a bit west of Eventide. 

Pants are from a random shrine North of Mt. Walnot, which is north of Hateno. The shrine has no puzzle, but the mountain is very, very cold. Doublet won't be enough. 

Each piece gives Climbing Speed up, and if you upgrade it twice you get a set bonus for even more Climbing Speed. 

It's invaluable to me, needless to say. "
