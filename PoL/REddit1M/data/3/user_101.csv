39780,"I'm having a really difficult with one of the towers in the region immediately to the left of Central Hyrule and above Gerudo (I don't know the name of the region). Anyway, it's surrounded by electric ball-shooting Lizalfos and those Poe-like dancing bastards. I've got some low-level electricity resistance food and elixirs ready to go, but now I'm having trouble even getting _back_ to the damn tower, as I was in Kakariko village cookin' up some stuff. 

These towers will be the death of me. "
