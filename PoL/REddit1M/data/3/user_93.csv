33797,"How is running around to collect all the teleport points skipping content? 

You've got to run from zone a to zone b at least once, at some point in the game. What difference does it make if it's the first thing you do from leaving plateau or if you do it as you need to go to each zone for a main quest?"
33879,Are you me? I've basically done the exact same thing! Finding ways up huge cliffs etc is so much fun
33937,That depends on which way you go 
34125,"Holy shit you just made my life so much easier. I managed to sneak up a tower near Hyrule castle surrounded by them and keep getting killed going down.

Won't teleport out because im stubborn"
34691,That place was so stressful! I can't even bring myself to teleport there because I'm scared so I use the one south and run real wide of it to avoid the dangerzone
34898,I just got one too! its a beast!
44846,"OOH i did that one last night, it's such a pain! Those lizalfos are the worst!

I then went across to Gerudo and a shrine on the way and the one outside Gerudo. I've done like 10 shrines (on top of the first 3) and haven't even started any of the divine beast quests.

I love how there are multiple ways to attack the towers. I have only 1 stam upgrade so can't climb super high straight up, but found I could climb up cliffs/mountains and glide down. So cool! Any other game would just be like 'you can't climb up so no tower for you right now, come back later'"
44927,"I love how vibrant the world is, I could never get into Skyrim because of how dull it all looks, was instantly off putting from day 1.

I've almost got the whole map discovered and the only main quest objective i've done is go to the science village and run the flame. That's it, like 10+ hours of exploring"
