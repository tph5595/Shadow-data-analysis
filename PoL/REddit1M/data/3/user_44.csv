15067,I'm actually conflicted about searching online where to find certain armor sets. Some of them seem to be a really big needle in a haystack.

Save your guardian shields. :)"

&gt;If you get hit by the beam, you pressed it too early.

&gt;If the beam hits your shield, you pressed it too late. Guardian shields won't take damage from a successful deflection.


&gt;If I recall correctly, I wait about half a second after the guardian turns blue. If I press it instantly, I die.

&gt;If you're struggling with the timing, try changing the distance between you and the guardian. If you keep pressing it too early, move closer. If you keep pressing it too late, move away."
