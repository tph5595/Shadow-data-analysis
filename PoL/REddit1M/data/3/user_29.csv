8747,"The amber earrings are actually pretty good if you aren't bothered about set bonuses or don't want to wear a helmet, they have more defense than most actual helmets"
9394,"28 Def, it's on par with the Ancient helmet, Soldier helmet, Diamond circlet, and the hat of the wild, but it has no special effect (aside from the fact that it's made entirely of amber and flint... plus, we all know that Fashion Souls is the true endgame ;P)

Every other headpiece is only 20 Def when fully upgraded"
10083,"Yeah, especially fairly early on (though apart from the Sapphire and Diamond ones, they fall behind when you start getting set bonuses later on (those two maintain their value purely because Sapphire on its own is as powerful as the Gerudo set bonus,and Diamond is great for sets that lack a bonus)

Amber is high Def (pretty boring but hey, it's cheap)

Opal is swim speed up (good if you've not got the Zora helmet yet)

Topaz is electric resist up (nice if you are doing the Zora areas)

Ruby is cold resist up and stacks with the quilted tunic (lets you access cold-2 areas instantly

Sapphire is heat resist up, which lets you wear actual armour in the desert rather than the whole gerudo set, which has 3 Def total. (Hilariously, a Link wearing nothing but the sapphire circlet is more Def than the entire Gerudo set, with the same bonus)

And diamond is high defense with the added bonus of guardian resist up

Plus, you get one of the R/S/T ones for 10 flint as part of the process of unlocking  the accessory shop"
