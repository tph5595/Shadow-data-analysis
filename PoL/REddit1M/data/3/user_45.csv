14516,You can get an entire climbing set. I found a climbing bandana first.
14567,Anything that drops from Test of Power shrines.
17595,"No idea, however, you can find equivalent gear at Robbie's for a price.

Personally I just use them till they break and tend to stick to simple steel weapons for the most part."
19248,It's under Dueling Peaks. Keep in mind that you can go any direction from the start.
45988,"They might, I haven't checked. I'm fairly certain there's a level scaling system of some kind - I just found a Royal Broadsword on a black Moblin in East Necluda near Hateno Tower in a place that never had much in the way of tough enemies and good gear before (I think last time I cleared it, it was all red enemies with, at most, spiked boko and soldier tier gear). If that's the case, it might be worthwhile just to clear some old camps."

59583,The bandana is near Dueling Peaks. I think it's underneath.
