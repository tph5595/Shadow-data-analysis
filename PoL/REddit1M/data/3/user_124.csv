60329,"As for my favorite, I was killed by one while trying to climb Central Hyrule Tower (I was very close to the top, too). When I respawned, I immediately had three lasers pointing at me from different directions; two from immobilized ones to my front/sides and a mobilized one behind me. I didn't even bother and just teleported somewhere else, leaving the tower behind for another day (I have since gotten to the top, though)."
