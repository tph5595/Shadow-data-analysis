Much harder than doing it by stealth. I actually ended up in the one room on a stealth run but didn't know what to do so I thought it was the wrong room and ended up dying so then I decided to just kill them all."

Actually it's funny cause even with Miphaâ€™s Grace I would die with one shot. It was a tough battle. I should have recorded it.

Ice arrows were really helpful in keeping them from calling their friends."

I really hope they keep this style Zelda and just upgrade the engine overtime to improve it all."
