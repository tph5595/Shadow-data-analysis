6683,"I've only cleared 2 Divine Beasts so far, but in each case in the main town for that race is an NPC who offers to repair/replace the Champion weapon in exchange for a Diamond, some common materials, and a copy of a weaker similar weapon (which can be found in/near the village for free, and respawns).

I assume this holds true for the other 2 Champion weapons"
