63176,"A 7/10 review isn't the problem. The only issue I had was that some of his criticisms were misinformed, and some of them were just plain incorrect. I mean, come on. He made a point of complaining about repetitive cut-scenes that are *skippable*. Either he has a plant pot covering the 'press x to skip' message, or he's reaching hard for things to complain about.

Some of his complaints are totally valid. Considering how big a mechanic weapon durability is, I can understand it being the cause of a 3 point drop if someone absolutely hates it. But complaining about cutscenes that are skippable, or complaining that you have to complete shrines as you see them when they're given warp points on the map and marked at incomplete - this is just ridiculous, and it makes me doubt his integrity.  

I wouldn't have given his review a second thought if all of his criticisms were legitimate. But, please, don't act as if publicity isn't the absolute life-blood of content creators like Jim. "
71736,"The thing is, I'm not doing any of those things. I'm just pointing out that  that some of the criticisms he made are factually false. It only took one read through to realise that - not a lot of time out of my day, nothing 'obsessive' about it. I assume you read the review as well? If so, did you not notice that in some cases it sounded as if he hasn't even played the game? Assuming you did notice this, why do you give the review any weight?

If someone wants to be viewed as a serious critic, they should fact check themselves before publishing. And if they chose not to, they have no right to be getting defensive when people call them out on it.

The fact of the matter is, Jim made criticisms in his review that are either based on ignorance, or deliberately misleading. So the question becomes - why? Assuming Jim isn't just an idiot who missed a very obvious text prompt (I don't think he's an idiot, but he might be), the answer is obvious, and you'd have to be pretty naive about the state of video game journalism, and journalism in general, to not come to the same conclusion. If you think someone in his position doesn't directly benefit from controversy, you don't understand his business model."
76159,"It sounded as if you were trying to lump me in with those types - I apologise if that wasn't the case.

But I can't say I understand the point you're making about cutscenes. A skip button literally does alleviate the issue of repetitive cutscenes, because it lets you *skip* them. If you find them repetitive, you literally do not have to watch them *at all!* Complaining about the existence of things that are optional is just insane to me.

I'm also very surprised that you and Jim consider roughly once every 5 or so hours to be frequent/constant regarding blood moons, but I guess that's subjective. 

And I'm also not saying that being a devils advocate is a bad thing - I think it serves a valuable purpose. However - I don't think devils advocacy should be taken as honest criticism, and I also don't think that anybody who calls out dishonest devils advocacy when they see it should be labelled at 'fragile fanboys'.

BoTW has its share of issues. Enemy variety, conforming dungeon interiors, weak voice acting. But repetitive cutscenes or being compelled to complete a shrine when you find one are just *not* valid criticisms.

And you're seeing best example of a contrarian review for the sake of publicity right here. Do you think anyone would be talking about Jim's review at all if it conformed with the others? Do you think it would have been on the front page of /r/games yesterday? Do you think Jim *didn't* get a huge amount of exposure from this? I'm not saying that was his only intention, but there's not a doubt in my mind that it was one of them."

80963,"The part that I said was subjective was the describing bloodmoons as frequent. I'd call them infrequent, or even rare. The fact that the cutscenes he complains about are skippable isn't subjective at all. If his issue was having to skip cutscenes often, then he should have said that, but of course he didn't because that isn't nearly as compelling an argument for fault in the game. I've never heard anyone complain about having to skip cutscenes before, because most people understand that it's more a solution to an annoyance than a cause of one.

And the key part of what you quoted is 'lest lose track of them'. There's absolutely no way you can lost track of shrines unless you're determined to never look at the map. I'd describe that as intentionally misleading - he's trying to make the game sound like it's restricting or cajoling you into playing a certain way, when in fact you're given absolute freedom to either play the shrine when you find it or to save it for late, with zero negative consequences for either choice. 

The problem isn't that Jim is doing this (though if every journalist acted this way it *would* invalidate the whole profession), the problem is that when he's called out on it, him and all his fans act all butthurt and lash back as if everyone else is just salty and his review isn't totally biased.

It's also worth noting that he said he'd give the game a 7 before he'd even played it - proof that he's made up his mind on how to react before even starting. He also implied that doing so would be an 'easy' way to rile people up and cause a stir. Source on that elsewhere in this thread. His prejudice against Nintendo in general is pretty well documented.

At this point I feel like I'm repeating myself, and I've made all the points I need to. Feel free to reply, I'll read it later, but I'm not going to reply because I have some work to do, and once I'm done with that I'll probably be playing Zelda!"
