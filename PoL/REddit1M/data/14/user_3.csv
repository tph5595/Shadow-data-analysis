1385,Weapon durability is actually one of the main reasons I haven't bought a Switch for this fantastic (looking) game. I'm definitely one of those players who values items and item upgrades more than others; Jim is right that it would take away my enjoyment of the game. One of the most important aspects of playing an RPG for me is the feeling of improving and becoming more powerful and badass. How can you ever feel like that when all of your cool shit breaks? (or the Master Sword which requires 10min recharge after every other encounter.... that is NOT fun game design).
2623,"It doesn't really matter if enemies drop better loot. I'm the sort of (strange) gamer who gets really attached to my items. I almost see my weapons as companions? Of course even in normal RPGs you are going to upgrade and replace weapons all the time, but once I find that one weapon I love, I will use it for the rest of the entire game. It's like in Dark Souls my weapon of choice is Quelaags Furysword. I've tried over 50 weapons in that game but nothing speaks to me like Quelaags. I've probably done over 10 playthroughs of Dark Souls and I still pick up that sword everytime, and I feel like it really adds to the experience for me. It's like going back to an old friend. I'm weird, I know :)"
2844,And what if being good at a game doesn't matter to me? Am I playing it 'wrong'?
3548,"Well yes, if I'm going to spend £400 on one game (Switch, BOTW and Pro Controller), I want to make sure that I enjoy most core aspects of the game. Weapon durability isn't the only 'issue' stopping me from purchasing it. I also think the main story is a bit lacking; the main quest temples and bosses are thematically and artistically all copy and paste versions of each other. I would have LOVED alot more boss and temple diversity aesthetically speaking. I find it rather bland and boring going around the same grey temple four times in a row or fighting the same purple blob. Think of how different Jabu Jabu's belly is to the Forest Temple in OOT for example. Or how different the Dodongo fight is to Bongo Bongo. These are some of the issues that have held me back from spending £400 on one game."
5781,"I've watched probably over 30 hours of it and seen most of the content. I know it's not the same as playing the game, but I think I have a good enough impression on whether my £400 investment would be worth it or not."
7620,"I'm not generally speaking interested in other Nintendo ips (never been a fan of Mario etc). Any third party game that would come out on Switch, I could just play on my PS4 or PC (which would look and run much better anyway). Maybe if they release a new mainline Pokemon game, I would be interested. But there's a lot of 'if's' and 'but's' there. Like when would they release such a thing, what would it look like? Would it be a mainline Pokemon game? Still, even IF they did release one, still don't think 2 games are worth £400. So for me buying BOTW, would definitely cost at least £350 because that is the ONLY reason I would be buying a Switch."
8467,"I do see your point of view of course. But when it comes to Nintendo games and consoles specifically, my point of view is valid because their libraries are so lacking. Most Nintendo consoles FOR ME, would be Zelda/Pokemon consoles, therefore the price of the console IS linked to the game. When it comes to the PS4 and Xbox there's just such a vast library of games outside of any first party titles, of course it would be stupid to say HZD the only thing worth buying a PS4 for. HZD isn't worth £360 either, but it is worth £50, which is what I bought it for because the PS4 has many other titles I've played on it. IF I'm only going to make use of a console for ONE game (which would be the case for Zelda) then the price of that console has to be taken into account."
