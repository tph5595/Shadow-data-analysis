1884,It really is sad that people got so enraged over the review and single point drop on metacritic. I'd say I hope this is the last of it but I'm sure there will be yet more people going on and attacking folk for holding a different opinion. Really is a stain on the community as a whole. 
7137,"Because his entire character is about being tongue and cheek. It's the sarcastic center of him making a video that is actually about how Nintendo is abiding by only certain portions of the law rather than allowing fair use to work for people who want to make videos about their video games. He's saying that if you follow the logic Nintendo is using to shut down videos that use footage of their IPs, then it's okay to pirate their games. Which of course it isn't, because Nintendo's legal rationale for it is also poor even if they are continuing to do it. "
25808,"I'll re-read his review since I'll admit I didn't read it particularly heavily as it seemed to have focus on pieces that I didn't get particularly bothered by but I don't really recall it being entirely as horrible as people are stating it was in the ways you said. I'm not saying you're super exaggerating it but even so it seemed less heavy handed.


The overarching complaint he had was that he felt like the game ""forced"" him to play the game a certain way. That being switching weapons constantly due to weapon decay, stamina controlling how much you can explore via climbing, swimming and running, rain halting all progress if climbing anywhere at the time, etc. He focused really heavily on that sort of gameplay being really annoying to him which I think is okay. I'm not of the side that thinks reviews should be objective, I'd rather heavily opinionated ones that don't go out of the way to purely shit on the game and will talk about all the things they liked but also what they didn't like. So I can see his complaints as valid, just not pertinent to my own enjoyment of the game. 

I don't think Weapon Durability had much of a work around except for the Master Sword. Even at high level weaponry, they still break pretty easily. Unless I'm using Barbarian Armor or Attack boosting food/elixirs, I still usually break a weapon or two against Silver Lynels which is a bit disheartening. He mentions that you can rest at a fire pit to escape the rain and wait it out but that it's still annoying to him since he just wants to get to the top. I'm not that impatient so I worked through it but that annoying him far more than me is still valid, that's why I took the review with a grain of salt."
28455,"I didn't read his review of HZD so I can't speak on that behalf. A lot of people have brought it up as a criticism so I can't say anything on that part.

They possibly are but that's what some people like a lot. And Jim happens to be one of those. 

He does say why although in his typical manner. He says in so many words that it's ""one of those Nintendo things they add for realism's sake without considering the impact on the gameplay."" It's not exactly those words but it's along those lines. He doesn't give it a fair look because it clearly irritated him a great deal, that much I won't argue with. He definitely focused too much on that but such is how he is.

That's a fair point. Choosing Silver Lynel is a bit disingenuous on my part and I apologize for going to the most extreme example. It just feels a bit odd that I have this subconscious want to not use my most powerful weapons against one of the most powerful enemies because of how rare and breakable they are.

I'll concede that. Jim did ""finish the game"" by killing Ganon but he definitely plays down the good aspects. I enjoy that you are able to switch between weapons so much and create a varied experience from it, making Link a Master at Arms rather than a swordsman with a Bag of Holding full of items. 

I can see that. He didn't quite spend a lot of time talking about the specifics from an analytical point about why the mechanics may be in place but rather that they were a negative to him in all regards."
