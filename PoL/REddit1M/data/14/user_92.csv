25589,"I used up a Thunderstorm Rod in a long battle and when I finally got to the chest I was rewarded with a Thunderstorm Rod. If the weapons didn't break you wouldn't need to be ""rewarded"" with them. Every reward I'm receiving at this point is a weapon that I had once and broke. It doesn't feel meaningful at all. And half the time bonus chests in shrines contain something like a single piece of amber or an ancient gear."

30442,"I've mentioned this previously but Elder Scrolls and Dark Souls both have weapon durability and stats to progress. Neither have boring weapons. Both games have collectable weapons and gear that you can discover or earn with unique models, powers, unique movesets in Dark Souls specifically, and lore behind their existence. This gives you a reason to explore. Something to stumble on that you didn't know was there, something more than a shrine that looks the same as the last one. The cool down of the Master Sword works fine. They could've had weapons with varying damage, powers and cooldown times scattered throughout the world, for you to find, but there's nothing. The destructibility isn't the problem, it's that because of it there is nothing to collect or search for. Nothing you can earn, unless you count farming monsters and guardians for two unique outfits and some masks."
84599,"The strong ones at least drop three weapons, or two and a shield, so it's actually pretty easy to get more than you used, especially if you start the battle with the Master Sword since you can't lose it. But that's another problem for me, for the past eight hours of gameplay I've had the Master Sword, a leaf for shenanigans, and then usually guardian weapons in every other slot because I rarely find anything better. Even the rewards for all the mini games, which in past games would be a heart piece or bomb bag/wallet upgrade, are now just semi-decent weapons, rarely if ever anything unique."
