4633,"I kinda don't get his core complaint. Weapon durability is a core game component. If he didn't like it he shouldnâ€™t have played the game. Its like saying ""I loved RE4 but the horror elements should have been removed"" or ""Gears of War is nice but I hate the over-reliance on shooting mechanics"""
11518,"Let me clarify. When a company with multiple reviewers gets a game about say, air combat, they won't give it to the person who dislikes air combat as a rule, or dislikes it outside a certain specific context. They'll give the game to someone at least impartial.

Kinda the same with Jim. If he dislikes weapon fragility (with the only exception being survival horror) he should make an effort to go in impartial or maybe just not do an official review. That's just my opinion, I'm clearly not a professional critic."
11839,"Poorly impemented in your opinion. I have friends who hated the sailing in Wind Waker as a genral rule, I mostly liked it. Just like weapon fragility it was not an established part of the franchise.

It's a matter of opinion. ""Many people like this weapon mechanic but I don't"" is a valid reason to dislike a game. I just think reviewers should try harder to keep an open mind when writing an offical review."
31888,That's actually a really solid point. I hadn't thought of it that way.
