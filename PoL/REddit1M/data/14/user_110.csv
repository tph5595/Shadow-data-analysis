41381,"I love fire emblem and i dislike botw's durability system. 

In fire emblem, weapon durability was never much of an issue. Buying a generic iron/steel/silver weapon usually doesn't cost much and will last. 

In botw, a lot of the weapons you find aren't generic. Link isn't locked to a certain class of weapons. He can wield swords, greatswords, clubs, spears, and bows. Within those weapon types are different effects. Some weapons are elemental, some bows will shoot multiple arrows. Some weapons are hard to find, or in the case of unique weapons, cost too much to fix. 

You cannot get attached to a certain weapon. I was fine with this in the early game, but i'm in the late game now and it still feels like my weapons are constantly breaking. I prefer to just stick with my master sword so i don't break anything."
