2041,"I dont think its fair to attach that DDoS attack to zelda fans, even if you're only talking about the overzealous ones, it was probably executed by a single person and there's a very big difference between being overzealous in the form of writing angry internet comments compared to doing dumb stuff like death threats or DDoS attacks. 

I really like Jim's channel and the Jimquisition is one of the things I really look forward to on my dreary mondays, but its no big secret that he's more than a big angry at Nintendo because of the copywrite stuff they pull and its kind of starting to show with his rants. 

Still, he cant be accused of being anti Nintendo as he did absolutely love Hyrule Warriors.
