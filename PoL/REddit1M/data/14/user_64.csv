13303,"I like Jim, even if he's more than a bit opinionated and extreme at times, albeit to comic effect more often than not. People getting worked up because someone else has a mind and opinions of their own is petty and immature. Having said that, I personally don't mind the weapons durability system in Breath of the Wild,  simply because I don't approach the game as a slice 'n dice rampage, though I'm sure some might do so. I find I'm having to be a bit more resourceful rather than forceful, something I find refreshing in a modern video game. Moreover, I am of the opinion that the weapons durability system was a choice of the designer(s), and as such is part of the ""rules"" of the game. 

Here's where Jim and I fundamentally disagree: I don't believe these design choices are necessarily a detriment to the experience. In other instances, there might be a legitimate argument about design choices being game breaking, but I don't believe this to be the case in Breath of the Wild. The established set of ""rules"" in the game are fun to try and overcome. In my opinion, this actually makes the game more interesting and challenging. Now, I don't think the game is perfect; far from it, in fact, but I do thoroughly love and enjoy it, regardless of what Jim's feelings are of the game. 

Indeed, I disagree with his review, both written and video, but the things I disagree with are simply opinion based*. Jim himself even acknowledges this in his written review, stating that he, and I'm paraphrasing here, wishes he could see what all the other journalists do (the people giving it 10/10). Well, if Jim doesn't see it, that's perfectly okay. He's free to have his own opinions, published on his own website, free of outside advertising and influence, an admirable achievement in and of itself. I'm not quite sure why people feel threatened by his opinion, since it only has as much influence as people let it. I should make it clear that I'm not writing this meandering mess of words to rebutt Jim, so much as I'm simply reminding the extremists and fatalists that we can have a conversation and disagree whilst still being civil. One disagreement isn't going to stop me watching The Jimquisition, and one ""not perfect"" review shouldn't hinder the wonder, fun and adventure people feel when playing Breath of the Wild. If it does, then perhaps the faith being put into the opinion of others would be better served being put into ones own self. 


*However, I will concede the frame rate drop can be an issue for some people, though it hasn't quelled my enjoyment with the game personally.


Tl;dr: If Jim's opinion of a game changes what you feel about it, then you never had an opinion of your own."
