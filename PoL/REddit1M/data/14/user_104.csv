34703,"I dont like jim sterling cause he isnt a good reviewer. He gave vanquish a 4/10 just cause he basically didnt like it. I thought it had a okay story and better then gears of war by far. I played both and gears was just boring. It wasnt hard, it was lackluster. He is biased in his reviews most of the time too.If he has hate against a company and tells them to pirate their games then he is a major asshole.*Shrugs* that is the way i see it"
34892,Let me laugh some more. This reset everything down to zero from needing items to complete a dungeon to having a completely boundless open world which do not require items for it. I believe its better then oot cause of that.
100831,Hahaha. Go play your fifa and shit. I rather take this then skyward sword by far. You are not limited by items to explore the world and you can decide what you want to do. Honestly i find this the best zelda since Twilight princess. You are just sad if you are shitting on this game cause games like this come around once in a while. Atleast it wasnt as droll as ffxv in terms of story. I have proof he said he would give this a seven way before this game came out just to shit on zelda fans and see their reactions too ;) so pleeease go away
101259,Also keep choking on that sterling fecal matter. His reviews are horrible plain horrible too ;) He does not know how to do his job i could do it better then him by far. He is extremly biased to nintendo even going as far to say to pirate their games. I hope he is banned from reciving copies of nintendo based products from saying something like that. He promoted piracy and that makes him a shitlord in my eyes.
