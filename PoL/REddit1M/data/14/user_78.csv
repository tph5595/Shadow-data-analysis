The actual problem I had with this review was the I'm not certain I'm going to write this correct but the controversy in it only based on the lack of knowledge of the game or simply ignoring facts.

Like if you like a weapon then (SPOILER) you can throw your weapon at a certain monster to repair for the items you really want to keep, the choice is yours and it's in the game but you have to explore to find it.

Like he has some points on some subjects I agree on but it's very clear that his review and again his whole youtube thing is that he makes others look bad to gain money, the way to hell I would like to call it."
