4042,"He tends to agree that Nintendo makes good games.

But he can't really review them. (Neither can Angry Joe) As Nintendo will simply pull their Content ID bullshit on his video and take money for his work.

It's sorta like enjoying HP Lovecraft for his books, but hating the fact that he was racist.

Edit: Review, as in, make a full video review on the game."
8414,"Becuase you have to do the specific nintendo partnership with Youtube if you want to upload that sort of thing. And they take a huge cut of your revenue when you do it.

Which is why AJ and Jim Sterling don't do it. Becuase it's a rip-off.

It's nintendo's way or the fucking highway."
27166,"He said the game was good. He liked the game! He agrees with you that it's fun. He just didn't like certain aspects, that's not dragging through the mud. You are acting like he shat on the game. He didn't."
28429,"Neverwinter Nights didn't have a durability system, and guess what? A plethora of weapons! And they are all good! Skyrim didn't have a durability system, and you also got a plethora of weapons.

I guarantee you that any game with a weapon durability system would be improved with its removal. I can't think of a single game where it's needed."
30218,"&gt; If he didn't like it he shouldnâ€™t have played the game.

Two things. How do you know if you like a game unless you play it? (Assuming no reviews).

Second. He's a game reviewer. Are you suggesting that once he ran into something he didn't like, he should turn off the game and play something else? It's his job to play a game and point out its flaws. He'd be a bad reviewer if he constantly turned games off."
30319,"He's talking about the people who are literally telling him to drink bleach and petitioning to get him kicked off meta-critic simply because he didn't give Zelda a 10.

He liked the game and gave it a good review! But not good enough for the die-hard fanatics!"
31471,Zelda didn't have a weapon durability system until now.
32719,Stamina bars and weapon durability are pointless restrictions and most games are improved with their removal.
49077,True. But he does do squirty plays of console games. 
51678,"Or maybe you could take the NeverWinter Nights route and make certain enemies immune to certain types of attacks.

See. Already improved without a durability system."
53573,Yes it is.  Weapons don't break. You can use a weapon you like however many times you want. You don't need to pointlessly horde weapons and don't need to waste money getting them repaired.
54430,"Sure. Since I used Neverwinter Nights as an example, I'll continue to use it.

Undead in NWN are immune to critical hits and sneak attacks. MEaing if you are a character that does specializes in either of those... better have a back-up plan.


Werewolves are resistance to all types of damage unless struck by a silver blade. If you are fighting a werewolf without silver... you are in for a rough time.

and to step into the realms of Paper and Pencil. Skeletons are immune to piercing damage, which is used mainly by Rapiers or Knives. But are vulnerable to bludgeoning damage.

You catch my drift? That's how you add versatility without a worthless, pointless money-sink that only inconveniences you by breaking when you swing it 10 times."
57587,"Not quite. Here's another example. Final fantasy tactics didn't have a weapon durability system.

It didn't need it. You needed to strategically place your units in certain spots for maximum effectiveness. Not only that, you had to make sure they had the best gear available for their class. Adding a durability system is a step back.

Any game that adds it is taking a step back, especially if you built your game around the mechanic. Why not have multiple weapons with different styles of fighting? Chivalry and War of the Roses does a superb job of this without a durability system.

I 100% agree with Jim Sterling and will never like durability systems."
76993,"I didn't say what. Go back and read what I said. If you didn't like his review., that's on you. But his website is still down because those fanboys couldn't handle their game getting a less than perfect score."
