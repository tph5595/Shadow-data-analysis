How far are you into the game? I haven't had this problem for a long time."
9419,Pretty sure most of us Zelda fans are looking around trying to find who the fuck he's talking about.

okay"
78015,"Sorry, I didn't follow our conversation.

I didn't like his review because it was a shallow review where his mind was made up before hand. I've been told he dislikes any game with weapon degradation and a stamina system. Does he also dislike ammo systems because they limit you?

The criticism comes from giving it a 7/10. The score doesn't makes sense, and he's on record saying he was going to give it a 7/10 before he even played it.
