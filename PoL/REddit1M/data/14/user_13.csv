3061,"So far, from what I have seen this really isn't an issue.  The only unique items in the game can be repaired, the super spoiler (but not really) sword repairs itself if you use it improperly, and all other items either appear in multiples or the creatures who carry them respawn durring blood moons.  I have yet to get a weapon I couldn't replace.  On top that of that no item is so important you absolutely need it.  The elemental weapons are nice, but you can buy arrows that do the same thing, from range, and they are in abundance."
