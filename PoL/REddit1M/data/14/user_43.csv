7708,"&gt; I think they went with weak durability weapons because they don't want people to be overpowered with their 100 damage weapons for the entire game.

This is basically it, and I think all the other downsides are justified by this reasoning.  Due to the openness of the game, you jsut can't judge or manage progression; there's (lets say) roughly four directions you can go that all get progressively harder and progressively level you up in gear as you get further.

The game would be over if you could take a weapon from, say, the Gerudo Highlands, and then stomp your way up Death Mountain with impunity when you decide to go that way.

I agree that basically *any* weapon should be strong enough to last an entire fight with nearly anything.  That said, I do wonder how many people are bashing away at shields and armour, destroying the durability of their weapons much faster than they realize."
7858,I wish there were four weapon mounts so we could display them all.  That would make a lot of sense.
8035,"&gt; One of the most important aspects of playing an RPG for me is the feeling of improving and becoming more powerful and badass.

So the difference is that Zelda makes *you* become more skilled and badass, instead of just making things easier for your avatar.  The best spear in the game or whatever is still no use to you if you're can't avoid getting clubbed in the head for 8 hearts a pop.

The durability system essentially just keeps your inventory dynamic so that you are rewarded for performing well in difficult areas without the entire game being made easier for you."
8285,"Right?

The only time I ran into inventory trouble since early-game is when I went back to some low-level area to explore some more.  When all my good weapons eventually broke after an evening of carnage, I was essentially leveled down to the level of the weapons that the weak enemies were carrying.

Once I moved back into more challenging areas and defeated tougher enemies and found stronger weapons in chests again, my inventory went back to being stocked full of amazing stuff and now I'm leaving high-level swords on the ground again."
8784,"I can't even remember what I've got up there.

I know the {Great Hyrule Forest Spoiler} [Forest Dweller](/spoiler) set is all mounted but that's about it, I think I have some of the cool wooden shields with different designs on them, can't even remember the other weapons.  Likely elemental greatswords, but since then I've gotten new ones of each type in my inventory anyway, and I have two of the elemental spears."
9218,"Try taking some time out to practice.

Get a crappy sword and a crappy shield and go isolate a Moblin in a camp and start sparring with him.  Don't attack; just get used to dodging his swings and triggering flurry rush.  Those skills won't be wasted because the major enemy types recur throughout the game, they just carry stronger weapons and take more hits."
9253,"Nobody is saying that, there's no need to be obtuse."
