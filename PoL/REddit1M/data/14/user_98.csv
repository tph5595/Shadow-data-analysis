28487,"My only issue with this is, once I know I'm holding a unique weapon I can't stuff it back into the chest for safekeeping until I can buy a house and mount for it. I'm stuck carrying it and having it take up one of my premium inventory slots. I know there's a guy that can repair the Girl's trident, but that's all I know about. I never really ran into someone offering that service for other unique weapons.

Also there's only 3 weapon mounts. The game wasn't really designed with collectors in mind.

Granted, I love the durability system, I think it really works and is showing how a tweak to a genre can give a game much more depth.  It stops people from running to location X, grabbing an endgame weapon and just using that for the entire game. Instead it causes you to use a weapon more suited to the 'level' of the enemies in whatever area you're in. That's great. "

Not to mention if something I really liked broke, I just know I'd find something else I like just as much in the next 20 minutes, and it didn't really hurt my ability to enjoy the game and kill everything in the long run."
