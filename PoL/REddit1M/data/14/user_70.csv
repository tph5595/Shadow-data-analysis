14407,"I love BOTW. So much that I'm seriously considering calling it my new favorite Zelda title. (And from me, that's saying a LOT).

That said, watching the unfolding reactions to Jim's review of the game was just embarassing. The fact that there was actually a thread just yesterday hand-wringing about the meta-critic score dropping from 98 to 97 was utterly mind-boggling. 

I'm so tired of seeing this, of seeing people not understand how reviews work. I'm tired of reading cringeworthy passive aggressive comments that bend backwards to find SOME reason, ANY reason to disregard the opinion of a critic that bruised their precious ego with a less than stellar review.

Sure buddy, a positive 7/10 review couldn't possibly be because someone somewhere maybe doesn't like a game as much as you do. No way, it's gotta be an agenda driven conspiracy to get...more publicity or some nonsense. Yeah, sorry, but that's not how any of this works. Like, at all."

People obsessively scanning a review looking for some reason to disregard it will always, ALWAYS find something.

If not minor inaccuracies, then they'll whine about tone, or insist that the writer must be biased, or have a political agenda. They'll point to a separate review and use that to discredit the writer. Throw in a few accusations Shill/Contrarian/Trolling/Wants attention for good measure as well.

Unsurprisingly, I've seen all of these and more the last few days. Fanboys trying to legitimize their hurt feelings into some worthy sounding cause.

That said, I don't know you. If you truly do pore over game reviews of games you've already purchased (be they positive or negative) searching for minor inaccuracies for no other reason than to uphold critical integrity, then I applaud you. 

Most people don't, they wouldn't have given the review a second glance if it wasn't 7/10. At any rate, I don't reccomend pressing the issue right this moment, as your voice would be lost in the sea of raging fanboys."

Yes, I read the review. He complains about REPETITIVE cut-scenes. That is a completely unrelated to whether or not you can skip a cut-scene. A skip button alleviates the issue of LONG cut scenes, but not repetitive.

And honestly? I agree. I find the need to mash the x button at the beginning and end of every single shrine to be a bit wearing. Same goes for the blood moon. I would have loved a toggle that simply turned off these cut scenes. The constant interruptions playing the exact same animations before I can skip it are a tad annoying.

...But I'm not here to defend Jim's review. I mean, I adore BOTW and everything. I don't even mind the durability system in the slightest.

Trust me, I am far, FAR from naive about the state of video game journalism. ""Contrarian reviews JUST for more publicity"" is something that only sounds good in theory. Does it happen? Yes, but not nearly as often as people think. But even then there's the issue of ""who cares?"". There will always be people playing devils advocate to get attention. That's not a major problem in gaming journalism, not by a long shot.

79086,"&gt; A skip button literally does alleviate the issue of repetitive cutscenes, because it lets you skip them.

This is a subtle distinction, but still noteworthy. The simplest way I could explain this is to make an example of how nice it would be if there was a toggle that let me turn off the shrine animations entirely. Just tap the shrine and enter, no additional hassle.

At any rate, the moment you finish a shrine, you still have to watch Link tap the little eye and watch the barrier explode. As far as I know, that part isn't skip-able and plays every single time you finish a shrine. I've done about 50 shrines and let me tell you, even I'm starting to tap impatiently watching that same animation play again and again. I would love the option to just snag the orb and get boot straight to the loading screen.

&gt;  I'm not saying that was his only intention, but there's not a doubt in my mind that it was one of them.

*Riiight...* so what is the problem here? As I said, it is incredibly rare that an established critic will go against the grain JUST for more publicity. It can be a side effect of having an unusual opinion, sure, a nifty bonus, perhaps. Yes, Jim was probably aware that his opinion might cause a bit of stir, but again, assuming this is his honest opinion... what's the problem here?

Of course, you seem to have already concluded that his review is dishonest. Which frankly I don't get. I already explained the issue about repetitive cut scenes which you have conceded is subjective rather than factually wrong. I reread the review and can't quite locate what you mean regarding his ""incorrect"" comments on the mandatory shrines.

&gt; Yes, every shrine is technically optional in the same way not rocking up to Ganon’s front door and assaulting his forces with a tree branch is – you can do whatever you like, but if you want to have a solid chance of actually succeeding, there is a proper, preconstructed way of doing things, **and the proper way of handling shrines is to complete them on sight lest lose track of them.**

... this line I suppose can be interpreted as him saying that shrines must be done as you see them. But err... not really? And if so, that's more of an issue of slightly ambiguous wording rather than flat out dishonesty. That's certainly not how I interpreted the line.
