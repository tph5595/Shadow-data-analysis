Your weapons gradually do less and less damage, indicated by it eventually doing about 10% of the damage it usually does, but never breaking. Just taking it to a smithy or using a whetstone-equivalent raises its sharpness and huzzah, fully usable weapon again! 

Doesn't hinder combat, especially if you run out of weapons, yet encourages different weapon usage if you run out. Win-win, in my opinion.

You also go prepared before every hunt and you know you're gonna target one enemy, and fight it for the next... 15-30 minutes or less, depending on how good you are.


In the Current zelda, Whetstones wouldn't be as widespread, seeing as even Flint can be a bit tough to come by. "
