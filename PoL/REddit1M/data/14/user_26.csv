as for the making use of your skill... Have you not parried/ or activated flurry rush? you're meant to play defensively learning and understanding an enemies attack pattern.  Learn the timing of their attacks and then get on the offensive dodging attacks for flurry rush, and parry's to interupt their attacks."

You can mix foods with similar properties to get a larger bonus, or you can make multiples of the food to last you awhile or mix the ideas. Make one medium level meal and a bunch of smaller buffs. 

Also staying at ins will give you an extra temp heart for a little more survivability.  If you're having trouble with the larger enemies perhaps you need to stop picking a fight with them directly. When you're dealing with larger numbers and you're the underdog, you need to play to your strengths.

If you can't take a hit play stealthy and avoid combat until you are strong enough. That's how I spent a  bit of early game. I picked my fights going for smaller camps and fewer enemies to build up my strength. When I felt more sure of myself I started taking on larger settlements.

Also keep an eye out for set ups. Sometimes you'll have a camp layout that'll let you sweep them in a few moves. Toss a bomb into a bunch of exploding barrels to even the odds. 

If you're dealing with large enemies with spear that can take a punch, try going long range and shooting it in the face, or using a weapon with the freezing ability. "
13895,"I think you're missing the point. People understand WHY they went with the system that they did. However the disagreemnts with the idea that they went with to fix it in general. The master sword already has a failsafe that makes sense. 

When it's near an enemy that is directly tied to gannons evil ways, it shimmers with power to quickly rip through it. Otherwise it's just an average/ possibly even weak sword that just heals over time.  That alone seems like a decent mechanic to keep the sword from being extremely powerful.  And personally I wish it was Just the shimmer mechanic that gated it rather than the recharge mechanic. It truly boggles my mind when the sword labeled as ""Evils Bane"" breaks mid boss fight from fighting a gaggle of baby gaurdians. 

Hell most are even willing to put up with durability but there's still some fairly legitamite complaints about when you find something you like that you can't find another copy of easily.  They just want a way to possibly get it back with a little grind and possibly a rupee sink. Like a few weapons like the champions weapons do and those aren't going around like ""OH SHIT ITS COMPLETELY BROKEN YOU'LL NEVER USE ANOTHER WEAPON AGAIN!"" 

Sure you can make the argument that it's to promote variety, but there's not much true variety when you get down to it. Hammers/ claymores large weapons have the same animation and move sets... Same for one handed weapons boomerangs being the exception which is a good thing.

One spear is the same as the other with more or less damage or an envoirnmental effect or a buff from armor...

I mean hell look at armor! I've been collecting armor and switching that out when it's appropriate. Hell I'll even make heat or cold resistance elixers if I want to use a strong armor in an area that's demanding in terms of tempature. 

When I fight electric keese I slip on my rubber suit. When I fight a Gaurdian I switch to that set. If it's a load of weaker enemies with stronger mixed in I'll either go defense or offense depending on the weapon type I'm using.

And when you do find the unqiue weapons, truly unqiue powerful ones, it's easy to get to good to use syndrome and never use it. Or regret using it when you try and combat never using it. I'm fully capable of exploring other weapons and their uses even if they arent the meta on my own. ""Oh don't use X weapon type it's horrible."" And the next thing I do is test it extensively over time to come to my own conclusion. 

If you're going to impliment the realism of durability you should take a note in everything that goes into it. A metal sword shouldn't have comparable durability to a wooden stick/ staff.   aswell as the ability to repair/ maintain them.  Other games with durability systems are starting to catch on to this trend and implementing their own methodologies on maintaining tools long term.

14982,"&gt;Except for weapons found in shrines, those don't come back.

And that's the issue. Some weapons do respawn. But for the unique weapons you get through a shrine and you have no knowledge if it's one of a kind, or if you can find it anywhere else.  Sure i'll pick up a weapon or two during a fight, but I honestly dislike the scramble for a weapon mid fight. It just feels like it interupts the flow of combat.

Especailly when you have no real value of durability to plan around. You can get into a fight with a gaurdian and see ""Master swords charge is almost depleted!"" And sit there crossing your fingers it dies before your sword.  

Hell I don't even know if the sword repairs out of combat or if it has to break completely.  "
