3855,"&gt; The combat just feel artificially difficult. you get 1 or 2 hit KO from random enemy which would still be kinda fine if it has a combat system like soul or Nioh where you can effectively make use of your skills to time and evade attack and strike back but here cant really do that here unless you have godly reaction and any miss will result in instant death.

This sounds like a you problem.  

I'm not sure how you can say there's no way to effectively make use of your skills with a straight face.  It's difficult, but there's a ton of solutions to every problem and if you're really that desperate you can easily spam food, because it's so plentiful.  Angles, enemy weapon hands, swing direction all matter.  It's a fantastic combat system."

4502,"I think people are expecting invincibility frames where they can just dodge/roll out of every attack.  

You can dodge out of attacks, but you don't get an invincibility frame.  You have to choose how to dodge based on the incoming attack. 

I had issues with one of the Lynel, and then I realized on his charge he holds his axe/spear thing in his right hand.  If I dodge to my left (his right), I've got like a 50/50 shot of actually dodging.  If I dodge to my right (his left), I've got a 90% chance of dodging.  On top of that you've got stuff like Stasis to help out."

Honestly, I feel like I'm killing stuff while being under leveled, just by using the abilities the game gives ya.  Stasis+ to get close, full charge Urbosa's fury twice and a couple more swings."
