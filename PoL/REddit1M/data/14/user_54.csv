10220,"Zelda literally lets you use your skills to evade an enemy and strike back (usually resulting in the enemy being killed because you get 5+ free attacks)

Dying in 1 hit is rare, and I play with 3 hearts.  Usually it's only bigger, or rarer enemies that do this.

With proper shield use, and evasion tactics there's no issue with the combat system in this game"
