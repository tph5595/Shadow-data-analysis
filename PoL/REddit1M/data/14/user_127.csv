78882,"&gt; It makes no sense to factor the consoles price into a game or a games price into a console.

It does if you need said console to play the game.  Everyone is trying to get the guy to buy the game but he can't do that without buying the console, so saying he doesn't want to spend hundreds of dollars to play a Zelda game is completely reasonable."

But then again those two consoles have 3rd party support and allow you to play more than just the same 5 IPs that nintendo has been milking for 30 years."
