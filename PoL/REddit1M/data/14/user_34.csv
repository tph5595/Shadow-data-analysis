5461,You're talking about the game as if you've already played it.
5922,"First off, the sense of progression is very evident in this game. 

Second every weapon, shield or bow you find is replaceable.  

There are 4 weapons you can repair, and one unbreakable weapon.

If you find a weapon that you really like make note of where you found it and when it breaks you can just go and get it again.  Sure you won't be able to get it in the middle of a fight but once the fight is done you can go get it.   

Also as you get later in the game you get weapons that last for a long time.  It's super annoying when people say weapons last for 1 or 2 fights.  "
6677,"Oh yeah that's another annoyance of mine.

BOTW isn't worth 400 dollars, it's my personal favorite game I've played, it's not worth 400 dollars, no game is.

BOTW, on the other hand, *is* worth 60 dollars, it's retail value.  60 dollars is also how much you'll spend on breath of the wild.  


You'll spend 300 dollars on the switch and 70 on a pro controller (which is entirely optional).  Those are separate investments.

Switch - 300 dollar investment for the hardware of the switch and the potential of it's portable functionality, and for the promise of new games in the future.

Pro controller - 70 dollar investment because you believe this controller is the optimal controller. "
8086,"You don't like the console.  So the console isn't worth 300 dollars to you.  It makes no sense to factor the consoles price into a game or a games price into a console.

No one says that HZD is worth 360 dollars cause you need a PS4 for it no one says that Halo is worth 360 dollars cause you need an xbox for it."

You completely missed the point.  The guy was saying he gets attached to weapons, this isn't a problem even if weapons break cause you can reget the weapon you were attached to.

And I also don't really get what you mean, is a weapon replaceable if you don't need to replace it?

The master sword lasts way longer than that, and yes I do find it more fun having to use a variety of weapons, rather than just the master sword the whole game.

Backtracking completely by choice, and also isn't necessary cause every enemy you fight drops a weapon.

&gt; but the durability is boring.

For you.  For me I don't just not think its a flaw, it has made the game more fun for me.


Without weapon durability this is how the game would've gone for me.

&gt; ooh a tree branch

&gt;&gt; fight bokoblin gets boko club, replace tree branch, tree branch is now irrelevant  

&gt;&gt;&gt; Find rusty sword in rock replace Boko club, Boko club is now irrelevant

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Find travelers sword and eventually knights sword 

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Go to Hyrule get royal guards claymore ... And now every other weapon in the game is irrelevant

36355,"""Why can't things just stay the same?"""
37376,"&gt; You're point for the back tracking was to get the weapon the player wants not every enemy has the weapon the player wants to use.

I made no point about back tracking.  I said if you really want a weapon you can get it.  The game doesn't force you to back track.

My point  (after back tracking was brought up) was if you want to back track to get a weapon you can.  If you don't the game doesn't punish for it cause you can get good weapons without tracking.  

There is a weapon upgrade system, but it's just though exploration rather than going to a crafting table or shop.  

Rusty, Traveler, Soldier, Knight, Royal, Royal Guard, Champion.

When I first started the game I had a number of Traveler class, now  I have multiple Knight's class and every once in a while stumble upon royal.

Random mobs also have this.

Standard weapon, spiked, reinforced, dragon bone

Mob weapons also typically have lower durability (unless they're carrying a not typically a mob weapon).

79054,So is HZD 360 dollars is Halo 360 dollars is every console exclusive console price + 60 dollars?
