13458,"I'm 100% with Jim on this one, hell I 100% expected this to happen. It was so plainly obvious that Zelda and Nintendo have a rabid, crazy fanatic section that isn't as small as you would think. It's really amusing that some notable game reviewers are hurting their special feelings. That people DARE to give a not-perfect score to a Zelda game!!!

Now, that fucking durability(fragility) system, is a dealbreaker for me and probably a lot of other people, I won't even touch the game because of it, as Jim says, its just a cause of stress and a party breaker.ï»¿"
