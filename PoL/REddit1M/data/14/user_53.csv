9866,"I feel the opposite, I think having strong weapons break is what leads to OPs point about not just using the strongest weapon. For me it's the other way, I wish there were some weapons of medium strength you could get that didn't break giving you base level weapons even as stronger weapons can help but still break. They effectively do this by having various weapons respawn near shrines, making it so that once you've fought your way to a certain shrine it raises the base level of weapon you can get, but I'd prefer just have the spear from the spring of wisdom be 16 damage and never break or something. "

33275,Great idea. You can keep your favorite weapons longer but they won't just be cost free forever.
