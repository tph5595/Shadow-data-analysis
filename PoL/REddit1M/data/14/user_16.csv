3581,"I actually dislike upgrading weapons. In Dark Souls if I want to test out a new weapon I need to use a bunch of upgrade materials to see what it's like since my attack power is too high to use it on weak enemies but the weapon level is too low to test it on regular ones. The result is spending finite materials to decide you don't like it and not have enough to test out the huge amount of different weapons that exist. I'd prefer then they allow you to raise your attack power, especially fi weapons will break eventually. If you want to simply upgrade durability they could just make the durability system work better.

Weapon durability forces you to try all the weapons and get accustomed with most. Breaking mid fight forces you to be creative and take your opponents weapons and sometimes having to be stealthy or strategic before fighting a group. But I will agree the degradation in this game is ridiculous. What they should do is double the amount durability weapons not dropped by enemies have and halve the amount of degredation you get from hitting opponents. It's fine to punish people for attacking through shields or hitting walls by fighting in enclosed spaces but it's annoying to be constantly switching while fighting a single enemy."

The game is fine and you definitely feel empowered in a non-manufactured way where your numbers go up the more times you kill X enemy. The durability just gets you playing in a variety of ways and suing a variety of weapons. The only problem is things break a little too easily in a single encounter so you end up tripping over good weapons and dropping okay ones for something slightly better. Just wish I could have a chest in my house to store vicious sickles and other pretty good, quick weapons.

I thought the same way, in Bloodborne I stuck with my threaded cane from beginning to end, through 3 playthroughs and then got it on my second character too. This game wants you to use the environment to your advantage as often as possible though, and having a good weapon throughout makes the game easier and les interesting. Best part of the game was Eventide Island where I lost all my equipment and had to scavenge are spare the meager weapons I could find. Then use the environment to kill a mini boss who dropped great weapons before taking on the largest mob of enemies."
