I think other players have already made it clear that having to acquire new weapons is a necessary design choice to award the player for tackling shrines and beating tough enemies."

The best video games compliment great gameplay with a sense of accomplishment, and I think that BotW does it well. Defeating a Lynel for the first time or putting in the extra thought to get that bonus treasure chest in the shrine wouldn't be nearly as meaningful if weapons were permanent."

I also completely agree that the shrines are a little bit bland in design and I miss the old dungeons and unique items somewhat. But I do genuinely love the story in this game and I like how the open world makes Hyrule feel a lot more important. It's not really about stopping Ganon as much as it is about saving the beautiful world."

In other RPG games like the Witcher or Borderlands, your weapons don't break but you'll still go through tons of random iron swords that are way worse than your amazing enchanted one. And unfortunately that's the case with any game that relies on stats as progression, but it's certainly not a problem due to destructible weapons."
