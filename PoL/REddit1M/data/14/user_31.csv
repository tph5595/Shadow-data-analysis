5033,"One thing I've been wondering about the weapon durability is how long weapons actually used in battles lasted. I mean, they were used with the purpose to break SOMETHING. Ideally it wold be your enemy. But I'm just curious how much fighting an actually battle ready weapon can go through before it's not considered battle ready any more ( vs also just being unusable)"
