12038,"It's weird because I don't think any game has a system which includes upgrades yet doesn't at the same time push the player towards linearity. Sure there are sequence breaks but the fact that there is a sequence to be broken is a problem in itself in open worlds.

If you're making an open world, and you tell the player they can beat the game and access any area from the beginning. How do you prevent them from getting the loot and then making the game too easy for themselves. At some point you'll have to add a barrier, which is the opposite of open world design. Even with those barriers you're at the mercy of power creep. These are really the limitations of open-worlds.

It's funny but even minecraft has linearity to it."
13256,Even if you went to get the master sword first? Some people played with that in mind (I did) and I think that would have simplified the game quite a bit much. 
13678,That seems very susceptible to power creeping. Although that does seem like a start to something I could see working design wise.
14296,probably on shields too.
