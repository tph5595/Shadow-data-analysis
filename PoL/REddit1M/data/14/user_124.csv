62007,"He said ""maybe polygon, maybe me"" implying that someone would give it lower score and get shit on by fanboys. Do you seriously think he had already decided on a 7 before he reviewed the game?"
98882,Or maybe he didnt think the game was that fantastic? Which is more likely.

Just because nintedo sucks when it comes to content creation doesn't mean that People like Jim Sterling will forgo any professionalism especially considering that it could cost him his career. If all he wanted was to create controversy he would have given it a lower score, and he would have given horizon zero dawn shit score, and all other big name games. It is laughable that you think someone like Jim would just throw everything he has done for some clicks, he doesnt even get add revenue as he uses patreon. And why the hell would he tell everyone that he would give it a lower score by purpose if he intended to do it? That is like a scamartist telling that he is going to scam you before he tries to do it, makes no fucking sense."
