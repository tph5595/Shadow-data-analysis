4103,"I can't watch the whole video.  His opinions are garbage and his over-inflated ego makes it even more annoying.  Somehow this man-baby has turned internet trolling into some sort of profession to continue to feed his ego and self worth.  His ~~reviews~~ opinions should NOT be counted with actual legitimate reviewers, and should just be removed from the internet entirely.

Either way, I do think that the weapon durability system is a good idea in this game, and it makes for some very positive changes in the franchise.  One issue that the whole series has had is (similar to other RPGs) the more you progress in the game the easier it gets.  Sure, some boss fights are still somewhat challenging, but for the most part it's just health potion management as opposed to actual challenge.  Having weapons break adds some difficulty to the game as you have to properly what weapons you have at your disposal instead of just running through swinging your best weapon at anything that moves.

Lastly, there is a very easy explanation why Link continues to break weapons.  If you pay attention, Link is the only one that does break the weapons in this game, and when he does (frequently) it releases energy.  He could easily (being blessed by the goddesses and all) be doing something along the lines of manifesting his spirit into the weapons.  Thus, the weapons explode after too much use as he is meant to be wielding the Master Sword, and normal weapons just cannot handle the force he applies to them."

Wether this is the case or not, he is likely just claiming that the Zelda community did it to somehow validate his opinions."

It's just the way he does it though that is rubbing people the wrong way (myself included).  At the end of the day he is trying to drag an otherwise great game through the mud to further his own personal gain."

Internet trolls from all areas of the internet will always make comments like the ones he is receiving, and it will continue to happen unless anonymity is removed from the internet (which I am not condoning).

Either way, he's just putting a spin on the situation to further increase his ad revenue.  Hell, there have already been several stories on how his opinion piece has garnered the wrath of the internet, and he's going to continue milking this whole situation as long as he can."
9188,Point being? There are other ways of profiting off of internet traffic other than you tube ads.
