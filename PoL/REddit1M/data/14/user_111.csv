40801,didn't want it flagged by NOA's auto-moderators. You best believe they're patrolling their brand subs and exterminating any dissent or honest criticism. 
41444,"50billion dollar company doesn't patrol public media site with their own forces? Are you fucking stupid? That would be the first thing I do if I have a brand and IP image to maintain. Period. Did you not see the [top reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/5vxxyh/reddit_is_being_regularly_manipulated_by_large/) about how subs are manipulated by companies for pennies on the dollar by ""marketing"" agencies? I didn't make that up or pull it out of my ass, brother, it's *public fucking knowledge*. Oh, and have you seen the CIA dump? Tinfoil hats are childsplay. This is a new era. It's not the 70s. "
50048,"""but it's the system we live in"" 

I'll take ""People who would justify Nazi Party abuses of power in the 30s if they lived in Germany"" for 100, Alex. "
50864,"i bought BoTW for the wii u

my brothers are currently playing it more than I am. one of them is rushing through it, abusing his amiibos for clothes and other pseudo-DLCs and the other is trying to 100% it....as for me? 

Well let's just say imma bout to go get 100 gold skultellas in master quest 3ds. I won't be touching BoTW until maybe spring break. It's not much of a priority, and frankly, from the reviews, kinda glad i got it on the wii u. 

I will definitely be getting mario odyssey though. That for me is a system seller on par with the SMAS on SNES. Zelda was never a system seller for me outside of the OoT exception. And ALttP being a close second. "
