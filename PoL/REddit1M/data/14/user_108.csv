40057,"Not going to pm you but i disagree with you. I thoroughly enjoy the weapon breaking set in the game. The only real concern is if I meet an enemy that i cannot kill after exhausting all my weapons. However, that doesnt seem to be the case in any way at all. I havent met an enemy that I couldnt kill without exhausting my resource. In fact, i am always overloaded with weapons that I have to throw it away.

It makes sense because it gives the game mechanics a point. You want to metal gear your way through some encounters to conserve weapon durability which is limited but not scarse. The point of the mechanic is to stop players from being a one trick pony, only knowing how to deal with every situation in 1 way and promoting exploration of game mechanic. I like it.

The other point is to stop the game from being stale when you get an op weapon and basically demolish easier monsters because you are being carried by a strong weapon. This makes exploration fun because every fight is a different fight and a different puzzle to solve. Zelda is a puzzle game at its heart, and the having players think through every encounter is part of Zelda's dna.

The only downside to this durability mechanic is that it is a system that doesnt work for collectors. If i want to be a rare weapon collector, I cant. There is no place for me to collect the weapons and achieve a 100% because they will break and I have limited storage."
