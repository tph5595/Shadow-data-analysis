3466,"I was somewhat bothered by the weapon durability system at first, but then I was alright once I realized that weapons respawn. The only weapons I decided not to use was the weapons you get from completing the Guardian Beasts.

Well, I did use Mipha's Spear, but I can always get it reforged later. Regardless, the only weapons you should really save are the four unique weapons and the Master Sword. Anything else you can easily replace after a Blood Moon."
