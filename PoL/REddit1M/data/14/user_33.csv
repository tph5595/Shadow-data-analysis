5424,"Weapon durability has never been part of any other game in the franchise so your comparison is a little extreme. It's a poorly implemented mechanic that doesn't improve the Zelda experience in any way and only serves to irritate the player with how easy every weapon breaks. Even the Master Sword isn't immune to the durability system because while it can't break, you can't use it efficiently either because it has to ""recharge"" when not used against bosses."

It's not about finding ""sentimental value"" in the weapons and armor you find (though it is quite a shame if a weapon/armor you worked hard to get isn't actually that good and will only last a few battles at best) to make a more balanced experience: the core mechanic itself is poorly balanced and even if it were fixed later, it ultimately does nothing to benefit the game or enrich the world."
