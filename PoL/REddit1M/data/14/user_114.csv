42685,"I don't like BotWs durabilty but love Fire Emblem (and played the older games). In FE the durability system is much different, with weapons lasting many more battles and you'll never need to stop and rush to the convoy to restock in the middle of the chapter. They also tell you upfront exactly how long a weapon will last, making it much easier to plan around whereas with BotW you just have an estimate at best. FE is also a turn based game as opposed to an action one, making all the menuing involved much less painless. The majority of the weapons you have can be easily replaced by the exact same weapon, and the more specialized and hard to get ones like your armorslayers and reavers have more niche purposes that make them last longer. You get most legendary weapons near the end of the game (or they're infinite use like Ragnell and Falchion) so unless you blow them on every enemy at endgame they'll last you just fine. There's even a way to repair weapons with the hammerne staff but its pretty rare. Overall it's two very different systems and genres to be compared to."
