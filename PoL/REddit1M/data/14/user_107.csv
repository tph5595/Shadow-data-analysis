36742,"I thought Jim made a good point: if these people are such diehard fans, why aren't they just playing the freaking game?"
37184,"Pretty sure Jim's objection was not to criticism of his review, per se, but rather to the more extreme reactions such as sending death threats and trying to take his website offline."
37393,"One could easily argue that ""the bad comments"" were way out of line given the nature of the discussion. Let's not run the risk of condoning bad behavior in the course of defending valid criticism."
38016,"I'd like to submit the opinion that Jim's 7/10 rating possibly wouldn't have generated the extreme reaction that it did, had we not reached a point years ago where a 7 basically became the low end of the rating scale instead of simply ""it's good but not great"". It feels like for the past decade or so, the only games that have garnered anything below a 6 or 7 have been the shoveliest of shovelware. This is how we get perfect 10s that still mention serious gameplay issues in review text, to which someone logically points out that if said issue really were that serious the game shouldn't have gotten a 10 (I can think of at least one GTA review I read that was exactly like that).

Bear in mind I'm not attempting to condone or excuse anyone's improper behavior, merely attempting to provide what I believe to be the proper context for why this mess happened over a stupid number in the first place."
