4304,"I don't think it encourages different play styles at all, when my weapon breaks I just switch to the next one and do the exact same thing I was doing before. 

And it doesn't help that enemy weapons are often super strong, so it doesn't really make you have to stop using your strong weapons, because they are everywhere. Infact at a certain point in the game elemental weapons kind of suck because they do so much less damage, and the odd lizalfos is the only thing that's even worth exploiting those weaknesses on, and you can just use an arrow for that.

Sure you CAN do some fancy tricks where you drop some flint on the ground and hit to make a fire to light a torch so you can do a spin attack and make an up draft to get some slowmo arrows into the watchtower guys while your stasised boulder comes free and flys into the camp then when the stragglers rush to get their weapons you detonate the bombs you've previously snuk into place with a stealth elixer. OR you can just run in and hit them till they die because that's probably faster, and it doesn't matter if your weapon breaks because half of them are holding something just as strong

Having beaten the game nearly 100% by now I can not honestly say that I would be playing the game any differently at all if the master sword never broke."
