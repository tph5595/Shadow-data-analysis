23162,"1% would be high, companies have no right to claim on review work at all. It is literally stealing and strong arming people. Let's plays are somewhat of a grey area (though I would argue that the content of many Let's Plays are more about the players and what they're doing than the game itself, which would place it under fair use), but review work like Angry Joe or the Jimquisition are most definitely fair use. The fact that Nintendo content claims that is appalling behaviour, and I hope they eventually lose a chunk of flesh over that one. "
