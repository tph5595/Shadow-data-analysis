4846,"I don't understand his analogy of hoarding weapons in mid/law game like potions in Final Fantasy.

I have so many weapons at all times that I'm constantly unable to pick up anymore. I'm having to leave behind chests and weapon drops from enemies because I have a full inventory of amazing shields, bows, and weapons that take forever to break now. I've been using the same Royal Claymore for at least a couple of hours in real time and it's not even badly damaged yet."

Aaide fromusing my bow to freeze enemies here and there, and a few electric arrows to make them drop their weapons, I still have my claymore.

The average person playing this game is going to have weapons, beyond the plateau and easier surrounding areas, that last a long time. And I have an inventory with 20 spaces for weapons, most of which are filled with weapons with durability buffs and attack buffs. Both of which will let your weapons last longer.

I just don't see any issues that others are complaining about with the weapons. The only way I can see these complaints being valid is if people are running around with nothing but rusty weapons, stal arms, and tree branches 24/7."
