2899,"I actually agree with most of his problem with BoTW. i will give it a 8 or 9 but certainly not 10. and i still feel its best zelda since wind waker.

The combat just feel artificially difficult. you get 1 or 2 hit KO from random enemy which would still be kinda fine if it has a combat system like soul or Nioh where you can effectively make use of your skills to time and evade attack and strike back but here cant really do that here unless you have godly reaction and any miss will result in instant death.

the Durability is just annoying, most weapon break on one or two mob at best. It need to increase the durability to 3-5 times at-least. 

and the stamina is rage inducingly short, not to mention you have to trade heart container for it when you already fragile enough"
5439,"The problem is, in Soul/Nioh, you are given cues and time to see the attack coming and react accordingly. In this game however, alot of the attack is almost instant with no wind up is really hard to judge, jumping distance is too slow/short and not a good way to dodge attack unless jump at the last second for that slow mo attack. and a single mistake is enough to result in death.  and this in combination with the fact alot of the mob is damage sponge and come in number makes it really difficult.  sure if i spam food and take my time i can kill most mob, but it still way more difficult than it should be.(heck even alot of archer/magic one shot me from afar)

parrying/jumping for slow mo attack is useful but difficult to archive with high rate of success. for example some attack is easy to see it coming. but sometime like those bigger goblin just does a quick jab which just give no time to reaction and one hit me."
