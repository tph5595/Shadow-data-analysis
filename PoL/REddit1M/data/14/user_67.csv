14090,"the durability isn't even the issue with the game.

It's the least Zelda game of the entire series; It threw away what zelda games are to be some empty shell open world game that fell into the open world trap of ""we made the beautiful world, what now?"" 100 shrines that feel pretty much the same. nice.

* no new tools after the first 4 shrines which is pretty much the first hour

* no real progression in the world (by using new tools acquired like pretty much every other zelda game)

* one of the worst stories due to open world, poor pacing because of open world.


Another series that went the modern open world route and did an extremely poor job of it after FF15 and MGSV


There's a lot of small details that are extremely cool, it's a sorry shame that they put more effort into them than actual content though"

More shrines like the one with the constellations would've been nice to be honest."
