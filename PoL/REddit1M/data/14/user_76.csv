16256,"I don't like the durability AT ALL, but it does not even come close to ruining the game for me - still love it. It wears on you though. Even if you find the ""badass sword of badassery"" to me it just reads ""disposable weapon number 7"". It fits into the bigger issue of there not really being any sense of progression in BotW imo. I would have prefered Skyward's system where you had set gear and you used materials to upgrade that gear over the course of the game. Even something like Dark Souls system I think would be better, where you are able to repair and upgrade a handful of meaningful weapons. "
