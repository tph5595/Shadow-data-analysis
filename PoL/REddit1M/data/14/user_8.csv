2780,"First off, if you think Jim Sterlin is a cock and don't like his content and think that he's an idiot for telling people that it's moral to steal Nintendo games, then don't watch his content, don't comment on his videos, don't read his reviews. He doesn't get ad revenue from videos but he sure as shit benefits from publicity just like any other content creator. 

Now, I think that his complaints about weapon durability (while exaggerated in this video by showing particularly weak and already heavily used weapons breaking over the course of one battle) are somewhat valid. Do I think that the game could have been worked without durability? Yes. Do I think it would have been more fun without it? Maybe, the weapon durability doesn't really bother me. I think that there's a point early on when you're picking up any item you can get your hands on. Wooden spears, rusty swords, mops, farming tools, etc. You just need shit to hit enemies with, who in turn will drop their weapons that you'll in turn pick up and drop your lowest damage weapon. That's what I did. At this time, you'll quickly discover that a bone limb, while dealing more damage than a wooden club, is substantially less durable. So in the future you won't really pick those up unless you're desperate. The same goes for rusty weapons and wooden weapons compared to full steel weapons. Soldier's broadsword or a moblin club? Probably better to stick with the soldier's broadsword because it will last longer. 

Do I think that it encourages different playstyles? Yes, I do. At any given point I'm probably carrying at least one of every weapon type. A spear, hammer, ax, sword, claymore, etc. because each different enemy has its weaknesses. Lizalfos are quick and hard to hit with a claymore. Better use a spear. 6 bokoblins at once? Perhaps the ax or hammer. You get the idea. If weapon durability didn't exist, I would always use my strongest elemental weapons. No question about it. They're strong, and provide an added benefit of dealing elemental damage, burning, stunning, or freezing. I'd be over powered and every interaction would probably be the same. Storm in, and kill kill kill. Because there is weapon durability, I save those elemental weapons until I'm in a real bind. I go in with to most encounters with a standard broadsword or spear, or I'll find an approach that will minimize my weapon use. I'll kill some enemies in their sleep or I'll drop a box on their head or blow them off the side of a cliff with a bomb or even a korok leaf. That's the kind of playstyle that BotW thrives at. It's not the best game if you're just going to run into a monster camp and button mash your way through. You can do that in many other games and it'll probably be more enjoyable in those games because of better swordplay mechanics. But you can't approach a base and chuck a chicken at your enemies and watch as they get clucked to death. You can't attach your enemies swords to balloons and watch as they drift into the sunset. The game is encouraging you to think outside the box rather than use your 1 favorite OP weapon the entire game, and I don't mind that one bit.

The more shrines you go to and different places you visit offer you neat and awesome weapons. When I first started, a few bokoblins were trouble for me. Yesterday I found one of the camps I attacked early on. I dropped in from my paraglider, killed 2 of the bokoblins on impact, and the 3rd one with a single swing of my sword. It was over and done in 2 seconds which was pretty badass. Those same guys killed me at least once I remember. 

And for every weapon that breaks, there's 2 more on the ground with decent specs for you to pick up. Losing weapons to breakage is literally the least of your worries in this game, except for very very early on (such as the footage selected for this video). "
4625,"That's fair, and in that case it doesn't matter one way or another to you if your weapons break because you can just pick up the next guys, which is fair and I do this often too. But if I see an opportunity for something a little more clever, I'll usually take it or at least scout out the area first from behind a hill or something. 

Basically, weapon durability isn't a big deal, and may encourage creative approaches but not always. "

""I'd never encourage piracy, I'm just saying that it's totally okay if anybody does do it with Nintendo products. Also, it's probably fine if you go to the Nintendo store in New York and shoplift there."" 

Idk what you're talking about. "
6061,"Yeah I'm a little surprised by how weak some of the weapons are, but I also carry a lot of weapons for a long time before they break. The royal swords seem really durable and aren't all that rare. 

I think they went with weak durability weapons because they don't want people to be overpowered with their 100 damage weapons for the entire game. Kill 1 Lynel and you win every encounter for the rest of the game? That doesn't seem like a good balance. Because the attack damage is directly tied to the weapon, not your player level like in most RPGs, they needed a way to make sure the player didn't run right into Hyrule castle, get something like an Edge of Duality or Royal Guard bow and just wreck shit for the entire game. Because that's very possible to do. I snuck (sneaked?) into Hyrule Castle unseen the other day, killed a moblin and looted a room for some sweet gear. The only thing that's different between an end game player and a 2 hour in player is the number of hearts and stamina they have. They both deal the same amount of damage using the same weapon. "
6339,"I don't know. It sounded to me like he was condoning it but for backlash reasons says ""lol jk just joking can't you guys get sarcasm???"" Why would you label your video that, say and say it multiple times in a video if you didn't condone it or thought it was morally okay? "
8337,"Yes, I absolutely agree. I love that I hit exactly as strong now as I did when I just started. Do I feel stronger? Hell yes I do, because I have better armor, better abilities (from the other champions), better weapons, more hearts, and more stamina. I'm substantially more powerful. But there's nothing stopping a 3 heart me from taking on a guardian other than that if I get hit I'm dead. 

I'll use The Witcher 3 as an example but this is true for most level-up style RPGs. There was a quest in TW3 that I got pretty early on that told me to go get some armor making equipment from a far away place and bring it to an armorer so he could make sweet armor for me. *Awesome*, I thought. I'll be able to get some really great gear! Well the minute I could actually get to that location (which was locked behind story progression at the time), I tried to get that armorer tools. I was blocked by a enemies a dozen or so levels above me and any attempt at fighting them ended in death. I finally cheesed my way passed them (basically running as fast as I could, dying, and respawning at a point passed where they were) and then I had to fight *another* monster who was again 15-20 levels higher than me and my attacks literally just took a single pixel off his health bar each hit. It was excruciating. I was a master Witcher but I couldn't slay this golem? That doesn't really make sense. 

With BotW you can kill any enemy just as fast as you can at any point in the game, provided you have the same weapon. So the only real way to show progression through the game is for it to reward you with better gear and more hearts/stamina. I really like that method because it allows you to go anywhere at any time without feeling like you're outclassed. "
9103,"Have you ever run out of weapons to use in a battle? I find that that's the least of my worries. Sure a weapon might break after a few groups of enemies, but there's always more and usually better weapons to pick up. And shrines often give you very good weapons. 

Aside from maybe the first 15 minutes of the game I've never ran out of weapons to use (and those were basically tree branches and wooden clubs). 

Does it make the game more fun? Probably not, but it balances the game, like I said. It's relatively easy to find good gear early on, even without going to the castle. If you had that for the whole game, you'd be unstoppable, because you deal the same damage regardless of the number of hearts or stamina bars you have. 

So the abundance of good weapons and the choice of gaining power (rather than leveling up like most RPGs do) makes the durability not a real issue. "
11175,"Every enemy you fight is holding a weapon. If yours breaks, take that one. Then you never have to worry about not having a weapon. Even if it's a relatively crappy placeholder for you to kill skeletons or keese with, it's better than nothing. And the plateau strategically doesn't have any truly decent weapons, because it wants you to explore other means of taking out enemies. These were highlighted throughout development and in the trailers. They want players to be strategic and creative with the physics. 

You're grossly over exaggerating the rate at which weapons  break. If your weapons barely make it through 1 enemy each, you're carrying the wrong weapons. Steel swords will last a fair bit of time, and they're very common. Bokoblins carry them even. 

And again, nobody is shoehorning you into playing a certain way. You can always pick up the other guy's weapon and continue your button mashing extravaganza. You can charge into an enemy camp and kill everyone with brute force if you want. You're free to do that and you'll pick up new weapons if your current one breaks. "
13077,"If you fight through an enemy encampment, you're going to kill probably 6-10 enemies. Even if your weapon does break, you have tons of opportunities to pick up another weapon that one of them dropped, at least one of which will be strong. And then there's the chest at the end which sometimes has something valuable in it. 

Not having the right tool for the job isn't the game's fault, it's your fault for being unprepared. Why do you have 7 claymores? Why do you need that many? They're probably the least useful weapon in the game. Can't shield with them, can't hit fast moving enemies with them. It's your fault for not having the right weapon for the job. The game offering different types of enemies is *good* game design. If they all fought the same, combat would be dull. "
14066,"I wasn't being condescending. You're arguing here about how the game design sucks because your weapons always break, but then when there's a *good* aspect of game design (different enemies attacking you in different ways), it's still the game's fault that you weren't prepared? Spears are the most common weapon in my experience, and carrying around 2-3 of them is very reasonable, especially when they're probably the most versatile weapon in the game. And even if you don't have a spear, surely you should have a broadsword which are thrown at you left and right. Either your argument was of a situation that should never exist, or one that exists because the player made bad choices about which weapons to keep. "
14374,"The system to getting those weapons is just waiting til another blood moon. They'll be in the same chests they were originally in. If you're tied to a weapon, mark where you got in on your map and come back to it after the blood moon. That's literally all it takes. Except for weapons found in shrines, those don't come back. "
15322,"No weapon is one of a kind. If you find it in a shrine, it can be found in the wild as well (maybe not the guardian weapons. IDK if those can be found in the wild). 

I do wish there was a % on how far broken a weapon was. That would be useful in deciding which ones to chuck. The only way you know now is if it's undamaged (sparkling) or close to breaking (blinking red). If they had a % next to them that would be very helpful. And yeah IDK if the master sword recharges if it's not broken. I suspect not but haven't tested. 

I've never liked pausing the game to bring up the inventory or map. That's why I love the HD remakes on the Wii U. They have everything on the gamepad so you don't have to pause the action. It's very seamless, and I understand this complaint and agree that it's not ideal. "
21658,lol I doubt he spends time on Reddit 
23219,Also true 
23894,well in most level up style RPGs you do gain health and attack stats as you level up 
34865,hmmmm I missed the humor. Probably hidden behind his edge
