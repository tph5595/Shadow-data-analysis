98121,"I never ran out of weapons even with that same set up (Except Stal Arms.) I loved using the Knight and Traverler variations and sometimes that last me so long  that I WANT them to break so I can find another weapon to break on the skulls of my enemies.


I think the only time I was on a weapon shortage was underestimating the black moblins and Lynels and fought them with nothing higher than Knight gear."
99989,"Hell this game gives you so many alternatives sometime I just go ""Screw it."" And just use my best weapons on common fodder. In fact. I go as far as to use my best weapons to farm and legitimately use the crappy weapons. That way I'm ALWAYS satisfied with a hard earned victory and I get loot to compliment that as well.

It's a win-win situation for me. But carrying all those super strong weapons JUST to have them is just illogical. 

I'm a collector too. So I place all my really good weapons at the house and when I run into a pickle I flee and come back with a Slaughter house called a backpack."
