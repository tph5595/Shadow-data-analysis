11502,"&gt; How can you ever feel like that when all of your cool shit breaks? (or the Master Sword which requires 10min recharge after every other encounter.... that is NOT fun game design).

I get what you're saying, but keep in mind that you haven't actually played the game.  You're assuming it's not good game design based on how you perceive it and your own expectations.  In practice, and over the course of an entire game, I think the system works very well and am under the impression the weapon durability creates some fantastic encounters and battles.

[Here is another perspective on the durability.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCMDG51cf5w)  Arlo never outright says it, but he's following the Dominant Strategy Principle from game theory, which basically says that if a player is given a ""most powerful"" option, they will use that option the majority time, because they have no incentive to do otherwise.  

If I have an extremely powerful weapon that never breaks, I will never use another weapon.  Maybe there will be a few times I experiment with something else out of curiosity, but otherwise, the best and easiest option will always be what the player defaults to.  Weapon durability forces the player to be adaptable and in a lot of instance, be creative as well.  "
