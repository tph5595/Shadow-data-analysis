Hitting a metal shield with wood is not going to make your weapon last. Missing a power swing and hitting the hard ground is also not recommended, but smartly trade blows and look for windows of attack, and they can last quite awhile.

There are also weapons with increased durability. They tend to stack up in my inventory.

I've had too many weapons for the last 20 hours (of 100 -- and I've done very little story).

You can also leave weapons in Shrine chests that you don't need, mark them on your map with a stamp, and come back for them later.

You're never pressured to trade unless it's just laying on the ground.

I always leave two ""shit slots"", and one empty; allows me to scramble to steal enemy weapons, and to use low level drops on tissue paper enemies."

I love the mechanic, but some people just don't find it fun, or flat out don't know *how* to have fun with it because it goes against their impulses rather than their instincts."
