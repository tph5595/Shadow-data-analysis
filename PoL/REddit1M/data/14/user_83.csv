My bloody Lynel Bow broke after about one in-game day, and since then I've reverted to exclusively using Soldier's Bows. They break after one battle, but they're more easily replaced."

I *could* use my Guardian Shield++ against a Guardian, but if I mess the timing up *by even a split second*, my shield is destroyed. So why fight Guardians?

Lynels drop some damn fine weapons. But they also take a hell of a long time to kill. So why would I fight them at all?

Weapon durability is an *okay* system. I don't love it by any stretch, but I don't hate it, either. It just needs tweaking in my opinion."

I could've said ""it's taken me all four Divine Beasts and about 50 Shrines before I ever found another Edge of Duality to replace my broken one"", but Mustache_Guy mentioned Royal Claymores. Figured I'd continue on that topic because I actually have quite a few of them, and I avoid using them because even if they're good at dealing out damage, they're also about as brittle as glass."
