4181,"&gt; The combat just feel artificially difficult. you get 1 or 2 hit KO from random enemy which would still be kinda fine if it has a combat system like soul or Nioh where you can effectively make use of your skills to time and evade attack and strike back but here cant really do that here unless you have godly reaction and any miss will result in instant death.

I just don't understand how so many people are saying this.  I apologize if this comes across as sarcastic, I don't mean it to be, but you know that you can dodge, block, and backflip, right?  I was blasting through the content so it actually took me awhile to realize I could backflip to avoid hits and open the boss up.  Even if I miss time the backflip, I still end up out of the way or absorbing the hit with my shield."

I really missed the boat on Stasis+ during my playthrough.  I think I upgraded magnetism first, but having Stasis+ is really a necessity in dealing with those guardians. "
