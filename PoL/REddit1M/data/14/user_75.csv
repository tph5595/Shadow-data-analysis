15830,"&gt; it makes the game less fun and more tedious.

You're entitled to your opinion.

Maybe to you, it makes me enjoy the game a lot more.  It gives each encounter an edge that other games don't have.  I've played nearly all major adventure RPGs and the same routine happens: I get a weapon that I play with for large sections of the game, upgrade it, or swap it out with a higher ranked one (that fits my playstyle).  The weapon management in these become a nuisance.   

With Zelda, it's actually pretty easy.  I keep that 60 DMG weapon for later, use the other ones.  No need to worry about it, I will get another, if not, that's part of the fun.

&gt;if they lasted about 4 times longer, I wouldn't complain. If there were ways to upgrade your weapons, it would be fine. But as it is, it's a horrible mechanic that makes no sense. 

I could get behind longer.  I've noticed the higher weapons last longer than the weak.  If you really want it to last, get the Master Sword.  It does ""deplete"" but it's the best overall weapon.
