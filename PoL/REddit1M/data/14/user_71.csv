14508,"Him saying that you are using bad tactics are not being condescending. Don't want to waste your good weapons on smaller enemies? Save a single slot for trash weapons and use that. When it breaks, pick up a new one.

This idea of ""All my slots are full of awesome weapons, so I don't want to use them"" makes no sense to me. If you have so many great weapons (and I know that I Do most of the time) then obviously you don't have a problem with finding weapons."
17265,"Every single time a weapon breaks (except possibly fighting bosses that you have not properly prepared for) you have new weapons.

I think this is the problem for almost everyone that complains about weapon durability in this game. They are simply put playing it wrong. You are not meant to hoard that awesome weapon. You are meant to use it, and you will get a new one soon.

""I have my inventory full of awesome weapons, so now I can't fight anymore"" - really? Do these people hear how silly that sounds?

Weapons in this game is more like consumables. They are temporary, but you will find more all the time. There are no point where you will run out of weapons.

Not using your weapons because ""it's a waste"" is like not using your grenades in Counterstrike because you ""might need them later"". Sure, but then you are playing the game wrong. Simple as that."
17506,"His whole shtick is acting as a cunt. That is what he does.

It does seem a bit silly of him to then complain that people call him a cunt.

Of course, I'm guessing that he don't mind at all, and that this is his way of acting even more as a cunt, as this again is his shtick. It's how he makes money."
17862,I was under the impression that all the unique weapons can be repaired/respawned?
17950,"It takes me less then a second to switch weapons most of the time, unless I want something very specific that is on the other end of the quick menu."
18159,"I have 12 slots of great weapons. Unless I intentionally try to break my stuff, I don't think I will ever end up in a situation where I don't have good weapons on hand.

Finding great weapons really is not an issue. Most of the time you have too many great weapons, and have to leave stuff behind."
18208,"Then you could sneak into a high level area, get a high level weapon and voila, never again care about weapons in this game."
18494,"They do if you keep whacking away on shields, which considering the other comments here, I expect is a very likely scenario."
18657,"Unless you are fighting something that you are completely and utterly underpowered to fight, you will never run out of weapons. Ever."
18834,"You will never run out of weapons. You will always have access to good weapons. No weapons will ever disappear forever. You will have access to a large selection of weapons.

The only thing you may not have is access to the exact type, damage and look of weapon that you want a a very specific point. You will however always have access to good enough weapons.

If this is a deal breaker for you, I just have to say - really?"
50970,"Your comparison show that you don't understand why Botw has a durability system.

The big differences between these games are that Botw doesn't have a levelling system, and that it offers more freedom.

1 hour link and 50 hour Link are equally strong if they have the same weapon. You can also get the strongest weapons in the game in less then 2 hours if you really want.

Without a durability system, the whole progression system would have to be reworked to be more limited, like Skyrim. 

I prefer the Zelda way."
52049,"What? So that your weapons only work on an arbitrary type of enemies? Your weapons won't break, but instead you won't be able to use them at all against some enemy types?

Is that really a better system? You kidding me?"
54111,"Are you really saying that I shouldn't be able to use my Spear of Awesomeness against say Red Bokoblins for example? I can only use the Spear of Awesomeness against say Black or White Bokoblins?

That is the only way what you say would solve the same problem as durability does, but I can't believe this is actually what you mean. Could you clarify?"
57075,"That still doesn't solve the problem that durability solves in BotW however.

You can get the best weapons in the game less than 2 hours into the game if you really want to. This will allow you to take on the greatest foes in the game, at any time you want.

If these weapons did not break, you would now be overpowered and lacking a challenge for the rest of the game. Your ""solution"" would mean that you maybe need to collect 5 weapons, but then you would be set. You would never again have to worry about finding weapons, you would be using the same weapons for the rest of the game, and you would be overpowered compared to most of the enemies.

The weapon durability system does a very simple thing. It evens you out against the competition in whatever area you are in. If you are entering an area where you are underpowered, you will soon find weapons that make you competetive. If you enter an area where you are overpowered, you can only slay things with impunity for so long before you have to start using weaker weapons.

This is a brilliant way of making a game where you can go anywhere you want, but still have a challenge.

On your last point, there is no ""money-sink"". As I have mentioned repeatedly here, you will never run out of weapons. If you fight against more difficult enemies, you get better weapons. If you fight against weaker enemies you will get worse weapons. You will never run out.

Weapons also do not break after ""10 swings"". Once you get better weapons they last for several camps of enemies before breaking, at which point you will have multiple options to get new weapons."
58085,"Again, this doesn't solve the problem that durability solves in this game.
In order to remove durability you would need to add some other form of gating mechanism to how you can get weapons. This would have to be either level and loot scaling ala Skyrim, make some areas too difficult at the start (say, by having a normal leveling system), or make some areas completely inaccessible. 

In my opinion all these are worse solutions. BotW did something really innovative with their world in making the whole world accessible and playable, while at the same time not using silly level scaling such as Skyrim.


May I ask you, why is durability a problem for you? Have you played the game, and what makes you feel it's a bad mechanic?"
