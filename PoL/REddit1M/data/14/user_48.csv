8709,"But it doesn't matter.

It's not fun.  It's a dumb chore that forces me to avoid combat. And there's no way to avoid it. If any weapon could be repaired at a decent price, that would be a different issue.  If they lasted about 4 times longer, I wouldn't complain. If there were ways to upgrade your weapons, it would be fine. But as it is, it's a horrible mechanic that makes no sense.  You can't do anything about it, you're just forced in to this shitty ""gee I hope this weapon survives the fight or I'm boned"" mentality. 

You can try to justify it until you're blue in the face but the bottom line is, it makes the game less fun and more tedious. 

It certainly doesn't deserve a perfect score. "
10580,"&gt;Have you ever run out of weapons to use in a battle? 

Early on? Constantly. Practically every other fight. Later in the game the issue wasn't not having a weapon, it was not having an effective weapon which isn't much better.  Even late in the game weapons are only lasting a few combats before breaking unless they're enchanted. And mini boss type enemies out in the open can suck through multiple weapons if you're caught off guard.

&gt;I find that that's the least of my worries. Sure a weapon might break after a few groups of enemies, but there's always more and usually better weapons to pick up.

Depends, if you're farming bokoblin guts because you just sold them all and suddenly you need dozens of them for armor upgrades you weren't aware of, you're going to be hard pressed for decent weapons. If you're trying to farm ore to afford the huge cost of late game armor and the last fountain, you won't run in to many decent weapons but you'll come across a lot of enemies.  

 &gt;And shrines often give you very good weapons. 

They're usually better than most, but this only makes my point. Who cares? They'll last a few combats and then they're gone.  And eventually shrines become pretty difficult to find.

&gt;Aside from maybe the first 15 minutes of the game I've never ran out of weapons to use (and those were basically tree branches and wooden clubs). 

I spent a few hours running around the first plateau. I never had a weapon survive a combat with more than a few enemies. It didn't bother me at first, I figured I'd eventually find a way around that.  Nope.

&gt;Does it make the game more fun? Probably not, but it balances the game, like I said. It's relatively easy to find good gear early on, even without going to the castle. If you had that for the whole game, you'd be unstoppable, because you deal the same damage regardless of the number of hearts or stamina bars you have. 

There are other ways to balance the game, which are far less annoying.  Ways that also give you a sense of progression and more choice, and a sense of ownership, things I mentioned before.  Upgrades, repairs, etc.  I can forgive the laughable recharge timer on one weapon. But when I complete a particularly difficult combat trial my reward should not be three weapons that will break halfway in to the next combat and one weapon I've already gone through a dozen of. 

Give me an unlock to upgrade something, even cosmetically, anything permanent.  

But taking something away from you that you just earned is so defeating.   Because at some point you won't feel like you need any more hearts or stamina. But you might still be trying to find an upgrade token to really stick it to that calamity guy when you eventually decide to go there. You just found a new awesome weapon and it's time to make it shiney.

&gt;So the abundance of good weapons and the choice of gaining power (rather than leveling up like most RPGs do) makes the durability not a real issue.  

It IS an issue. Because your being shoehorned into a very specific way of fighting that isn't remotely entertaining. It's boring. It's bad balance. And it could be so much better."
12665,"&gt;Every enemy you fight is holding a weapon. If yours breaks, take that one. Then you never have to worry about not having a weapon. Even if it's a relatively crappy placeholder for you to kill skeletons or keese with, it's better than nothing. And the plateau strategically doesn't have any truly decent weapons, because it wants you to explore other means of taking out enemies. These were highlighted throughout development and in the trailers. They want players to be strategic and creative with the physics. 

This is at it's core bad game design.  You should always be advancing towards the end goal, boy constantly battling against your own ability to fight. 

Fun unique, non combative ways to take out enemies are rare. So rare that it's not a valid argument for weapon fragility. You are almost never presented with traps or tricks to wipe out encampments. The game is mostly about fighting bad guys with weapons.

Which is why constantly being forced to replace them is so frustrating.  

It's one thing to feel to weak to take on certain enemies. That's fine, it makes finally beating them so much more satisfying.

It's quite another to avoid combat because ""I only have nice weapons and I don't want to waste them on these guys."" Having a handful of weapons that do 60+ damage are wasted on a keese or skeleton with 1 hit point.  Better just to run.



&gt;You're grossly over exaggerating the rate at which weapons  break. If your weapons barely make it through 1 enemy each, you're carrying the wrong weapons. Steel swords will last a fair bit of time, and they're very common. Bokoblins carry them even.

No, you're misunderstanding me.  One combat, not one enemy.  There are several enemies to an encampment. Weapons typically do not last through more than one unless they're special ""durability up"" weapons.

&gt;And again, nobody is shoehorning you into playing a certain way. You can always pick up the other guy's weapon and continue your button mashing extravaganza. You can charge into an enemy camp and kill everyone with brute force if you want. You're free to do that and you'll pick up new weapons if your current one breaks.  

You are being shoehorned by the very mechanics of the game.  Do you like throwing spears? Better not until it's almost broken or you'll just waste it. Do you like fighting with a giant axe? Well now it's gone, guess you'll have to make do with this giant hammer.  Oh, here's a lizalfos, better get my one handed... Nope all I have are these damn claymores. "
12981,"I'll have to check, I haven't gone back in to any of them. But those weapons typically suck.  They're powerful but have a crazy low durability."
13734,I don't think being condescending is helping you make your point at all.
13898,"He did. He spent several minutes saying that in fact. 

He said you shouldn't do it, but that if you did do it, he did not see a moral problem with that. "
