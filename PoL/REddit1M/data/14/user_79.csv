19003,"i cant imagine how theese people who cry about weapon durability in zelda would react to playing one of the older fire emblem games (before awakening). hell, even that fanbase complained when they **removed** durability in fates cause casuals.

ive sort of been looking at the durability in zelda as being similar to halo, you start off with an assault rifle and it works fine, but all the enemies you fight are aliens, so eventually youll lose your AR ammo and have to scavenge for plasma weapons, or in halo 3 you can find a spartan laser (mighty strong weapon) and it can only fire like 3 shots (been a while, dont remember but something like that) so you have to choose to either keep it in your second weapon slot and use it for something big later in the mission, or make your secondary another expendable weapon."
