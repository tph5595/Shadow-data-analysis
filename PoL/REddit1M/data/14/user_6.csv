2308,"&gt; One of the most important aspects of playing an RPG for me is the feeling of improving and becoming more powerful and badass. How can you ever feel like that when all of your cool shit breaks? 

It's called player skill.

Used to be a time honored tradition.

If you're losing powerful weapons to mid-level enemies that aren't wielding something worth picking up then you're, well, you're not very good at the game.

EDIT: Dear Lord, how is this downvoted? Zelda's roots are in the arcade. I honestly expected more from its fans."

I can tell.

You don't grind in this game.

You can farm, but you don't farm weak enemies with powerful weapons unless you're really, really bad at it."
3908,"Of course not.

You're playing it badly.

It's like saying Monster Hunter is poorly designed because you have to be skilled/knowledgeable."

Because that's just about the only way you'll get them out of pretty much every community.

Some people are _____

Some people are both."
5232,"What did I say that wasn't true?

EDIT: Yeah, thought so."
5438,"Weak weapons are more abundant than weak enemies and they last longer than them.

You literally walk away from camps with shields and weapons lying all over the ground."
26503,"I'm not sure why you'd bring a powerful weapon in against mid-level/low-level enemies in the first place. Use them against powerful enemies with powerful weapons.

Resource management is a huge aspect of the game, just like in the original TLoZ."
31955,"It didn't have a stamina meter until Skyward Sword.

What's your point?"
33877,"BotW would suffer for it. For the same reason Fire Emblem would.

Weapons are a consumable resource and need to be properly managed. Resource management is part of the game as with the original TLoZ."
