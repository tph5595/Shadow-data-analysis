12917,About the shrine thing:  I neef to check but I heard blood moons reset the 'test of strength' style enemies that hold a bunch of weapons. They drop a decent number of weapons (depending on the  shrine) and arnt too hard to beat once you've faced a bunch. They telegraph all their attacks pretty hardcore.
