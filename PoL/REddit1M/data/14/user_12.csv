3056,"Uh, dude, everyone grinds on low level enemies. And sometimes your breakable weapons may break when you're in the middle of grinding, that just happens, not because of skill but because the game decided that weapon should break at X hits, and you've now gotten to X hits.

I haven't played BoTW but I have played Dying Light which has breakable weapons, and a lot of my weapons broke during encounters against some low level crap-tier zombies. Even when I've maxed out everything in the game, it still happens. This happens not because of player skill or even his level, but because of the foundation of this mechanic, that a weapon needs to break after a certain number of hits, no matter who you are or what you play.

That guy could be excellent at the game, his weapons just broke too fast."
