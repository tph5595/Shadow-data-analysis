23754,"Here's the real issue in my opinion. Everyone tlaks about the durability system but no one asked the most important question: WHY? You may like this or not, but no one seems to try to underdstand the system. So I'll write how I interpret the system. I believe the system is meant to counter cheese in the kind of open world game. Think about it! In Skyrim, when you start your 10th new game, the first thing you do, you look at your shopping list. You know where all the easy late game gear is and you grab it as fast as possible, then the game becomes mundane. I believe Nintendo gave weapons durability to avoid such things. You may know where the best weapons are, but you'll only be able to be oevrpowered for a short while before you are back to being where you're supposed to be. It is my opinion (so maybe not a fact, but hopefully it is) that Nintendo put a tremendous amount of ressources in making sure people don't cheese the game and I believe they succeeded. "
