2687,"&gt; One of the most important aspects of playing an RPG for me is the feeling of improving and becoming more powerful and badass. 

You will definitely feel this. You will get permanent upgrades to health and stamina and armor, and will find better weapons as you progress. I was skeptical about durability too, but once you actually play the game it feels like it definitely belongs. It gives you a sense of excitement when exploring and finding new stuff. Something I compare it to would be like Skyrim and how it's completely different. When you got your super upgraded gear in Skyrim, there was little reason to explore and dungeon loot was very underwhelming. This doesn't happen in BotW. Almost every time I find a weapon at the end of something, it's exciting even if I've had it before. "
