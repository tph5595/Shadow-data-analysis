2794,"The durability system really feels like they were testing it for a hardcore mode of some sort, and decided it was fine for the game itself. I don't mind weapons doing less damage as they get degraded, or allowing me to repair broken weapons. But having my scimitar break after a fight with a group of gobins that apparently have rocks for skin is eye rolling.

I personally think the best type of weapon systems are those that allow you to upgrade weapons, instead of break weapons. Because then it feels like actual progression, has choices (sometimes), and lets you build a connection to something you built yourself. 

The weapon durability in this game has a place, I just think it would have a place in the ""hard"" mode coming this summer over the current game. But we know they won't change it, so I am just going to have to live with the current system.

Like imagine if you found 5 scimitars, and instead of having them break after 10 swings, you could go to a blacksmith and have them break a few of them down to upgrade one to your liking or something. More damage, faster attack speed, etc. Always give the player more things, don't take things away. Don't punish me for playing the game.

Irrelevant to the video, but the menu system in this game is a relic of the 90s that should be burned along with the wii u frame rate.

Still loving the game, most engrossed I have been in years, just wish those few things could have been better.

3119,"I feel you man, I really wish this game focused on upgrading your arsenal instead of breaking it. Dark souls has an amazing weapon system that allows durability/upgrades. 

Breath of the Wild seems to sacrifice this type of thing for hammering the theme of the world into your head as hard as possible. Where everything is overgrown and broken, not even your weapons are safe. I don't love or hate the system, I just wish I had a choice. 

Don't let that system stop you from getting it eventually, its just a different style. It definitely creates super interesting gameplay moments when your weapon breaks and you can pick something up, but those are pretty rare. This game is more about exploration/puzzles than combat, and those parts are some of the best I have seen."
14227,"that definitely did feel like a way they were kinda forced into breaking weapons. Unless they leveled the whole world with the player and then walled off the final area until you do x, y, z. Or even you could have just not got certain weapon drops until x number of enemies killed or some other arbitrary number. 

There is no simple answer to any of it, some games just do it better than others. I can't think of a perfect weapon system in any game I have played. "
35194,"I get your point of not hindering exploitation, but to be fair the armor system kind of does that all ready if you are trying to be the strongest. In any open world game you are going to have grinding unless you just avoid all of that and make everything super linear in damage/armor. 

I'm honestly surprised they added that type of system for armor considering how weapons are set up. 

Overall I think I just want options. You can play an open world game (if it's well designed) and beat it without needing to fully upgrade every piece of equipment. But it's nice for that who want to spend more time with weapon x or make some kind of limitation for themselves.

I like the degredation system to an extent, like I think it's really cool for the whole survival theme. I just wish that was some sort of difficulty choice or something. I would probably do a playthrough with both systems tbh.

At the point in my playthrough I'm at now the weapon system only really bugs me when I get what seems to be a legendary weapon, passed down for generations of a culture or something to that effect. Breaks in a few fights. Idk if there is a solution nestled within the game they wanted to design, but I can definitely see why it's a sticking point for a lot of people."
49709,"I don't see any issues with difficulty choices or game choices overall. Nintendo definitely hasn't been the biggest proponent of them, so I definitely didn't go in expecting it. And if their design philosophy is hitched onto the weapon system existing as is it's a weak philosophy.

Also I 100% get their design philosophy and think it's remarkably well put together, its just not 100% fun for me to go along with that cohesion.

As with most other open world games the setting has really been the star of the game for me. So for me combat is pretty low on priorities, but worthwhile to note when I talk about it. Hell at least they did something different on the Zelda weapon formula, gotta give them credit for that. Interested in what they think ""hard"" mode should entail."
