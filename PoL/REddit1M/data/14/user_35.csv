6076,"The weapon durability mechanic is just another resource to make you choose how to overcome an obstacle. It's no different than having an arsenal of guns with limited ammo. If you have a BFG, why would you use any other weapon? Because it's limited by ammo. Compare that to weapon durability in BotW. Yes you lose the weapon entirely, but pretty much all weapons are pretty easy to obtain once again. No different than using all your ammo and finding more later.

I think the weapon breaking mechanic offers more variety. It also bolsters the whole theme of scavenging and preparing. I'd even argue it maintains character progression without leveling/experience and all that jazz.

Lastly, Sterling's opinion does not invalidate yours. He's entitled to his, you're entitled to yours. No one is entitled to attack some for their opinion."
