51581,"Yeah, if you're paying attention, at least half of all encampments have some way to kill or at least seriously damage most if not all enemies in the area: Boulders or explosive barrels positioned to be dropped on or lobbed via stasis, or barrels in the camp that can be shot at; vantage points to shoot arrows or lob bombs; giant metal boxes or slabs of metal to beat the shit out of enemies with; thunder storms with metal weapons lying around that you can throw at your enemies; Cliffsides you can hit them off of; many others that I haven't even considered. 

I find myself throwing away otherwise good weapons to pick up better or preferable ones almost as often as I find myself breaking weapons. And the only combat I occasionally avoid is particularly strong moblins, mini bosses, and guardians. "
51795,All special weapons have a person in that area who will make a new one if it breaks. 
53476,It does. Every champion weapon can be remade by an npc.
