35108,"&gt; Second every weapon, shield or bow you find is replaceable.

so are the weapons, shields and bows of rpg games with out durability.

&gt; 
There are 4 weapons you can repair, and one unbreakable weapon.

mentions these in the video, and if you're talking about the master sword being ""unbreakable"" yeah totally fun fighting 3 enemies with it and waiting 10 minutes to use it again.
&gt; If you find a weapon that you really like make note of where you found it and when it breaks you can just go and get it again. Sure you won't be able to get it in the middle of a fight but once the fight is done you can go get it.

back tracking wooh

&gt; Also as you get later in the game you get weapons that last for a long time. It's super annoying when people say weapons last for 1 or 2 fights.

they still don't last very long at all

like come on I love this game, but the durability is boring.

Master sword doesn't last very long in my experience

You're point for the back tracking was to get the weapon the player wants not every enemy has the weapon the player wants to use.
&gt;For you. For me I don't just not think its a flaw, it has made the game more fun for me.    

No, reason to fight this

&gt;Go to Hyrule get royal guards claymore ... And now every other weapon in the game is irrelevant

The great thing about zelda is the weapon play styles feel different, spears, clubs, claymores and one handed weapons all feel different to me which is why I players would us a variety of weapons. 

a lot of players would even use weapons they think looks cool just because they get attached to that weapon, even better if they allow you to upgrade your weapons so there's not ""the best weapon""
