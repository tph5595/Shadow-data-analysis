13842,"&gt; It's a dumb chore that forces me to avoid combat.

why would it make you avoid combat? i've been playing the game pretty normally, and i have weapons coming out of my ears. i've got probably 20 weapon slots in my inventory and i'm still always full of weapons, and i use them as fast as i can. the only time i'm ever low on weapons is right after a really tough fight vs a Lynel or something. i have only completely run out of weapons one time, and it was when i stumbled upon a moderate test of strength shrine relatively early into the game. and, i was back up to having weapons after a few camps of enemies and a bit of exploring.

the durability mechanic is such a non-issue. just play the game normally cycling through your weapons as they break. do you think you'll never get replacements or something?

&gt; You can try to justify it until you're blue in the face but the bottom line is, it makes the game less fun and more tedious.

does limited ammunition make FPS less fun? do you just turn on ""infinite ammo"" cheats in every FPS you play?"
14888,"""refilling ammo"" is the equivalent of just getting new weapons each fight. oftentimes, even the replacements for the same weapons."
15449,"because then you don't have the resource management aspect. you no longer get the sensation of ""making do with what you have"", which is a key pillar of survival games."
16303,"it's not pointless, the weapons are different types with different movesets and visuals. it also prevents the ""skyrim problem"" where after a while 90% of loot is trivial; in botw, i have no problem carrying around some weaker weapons that i can use to clear random camps so that i can save my best weapons for bosses. it's also fun to be able to ""throw"" weapons or light wooden ones on fire for some extra damage because they're not irreplaceable.

the game heavily emphasizes resource management and environmental awareness, which are core concepts for survival games.  it's absolutely not the most hardcore survival game, but those elements are prominent and the title even alludes to that focus."

if you don't care about the aesthetics, and weapons drop like candy for most of the game, then why is it even an issue? just cycle through weapons that drop, it wouldn't even be that difficult to just limit yourself to only weapon types you like. once you get [the master sword](/spoiler) then it's even easier to just stick to the classic Zelda sword'n'board style.

&gt; The big problem of varied movesets is that if you don't like the moveset, it's not fun. That's why for example being forced into using spears could annoy people.

same could be said of ammo in FPS. i understand what the real problem here is, though.

it's a mental block that people don't want to get over, so they say the game is poorly designed. i saw the same thing with the 3-day cycle in Majora's Mask. it's very clever design that allowed them to do a lot of interesting things, but most people will criticize it heavily or won't touch it at all because they hate being put on a timer. Dark Souls is another example: people couldn't get over that dying is just part of the game and that you need to learn movesets to progress, so they blamed the game design.

they can't get past this mental block and want to blame that on the game's mechanics. any effect on gameplay is exaggerated by gamers who are frustrated that the things they have are finite."
