That said, I still love the system and it keeps thing interesting. I enjoy switching between weapons and being on edge and having to make fast decisions and altering my play style from just mashing Y with one weapon.

But while it's unrealistic, I believe it was pretty necessary. It's realistic and satisfying to defeat a strong enemy and gain their weapon, but as some have said in this thread, if you just use one high powered weapon the whole time it kinda breaks the game."
