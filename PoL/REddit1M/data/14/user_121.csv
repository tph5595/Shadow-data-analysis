51946,"&gt;I wasn't being condescending. 

&gt;Not having the right tool for the job isn't the game's fault, it's your fault for being unprepared.

I'm not him but I think you were, whether you meant to be or not. IMO, etc."
53640,So it would be fine then if someone sarcastically joked that you should go and rob his house because someone might like to and it's okay because it's \#justajoke?
53839,"&gt;I really, really don't think ""we"" DDOS'd him, though. Maybe one guy. But more than likely, I think, is that his site got a lot of hits over the controversial review.

Yes, and if he claims he got DDOS'd then he potentially gets more rage traffic, getting more ad revenue."
54195,"&gt;I used up a Thunderstorm Rod in a long battle and when I finally got to the chest I was rewarded with a Thunderstorm Rod. 

Yeah, this is one thing that i don't understand about people suggesting that you go back to shrines and get guardian weapons, etc. Because surely you would go in there, waste most of your weapons, and then when you come out, you have to go gather up some more ""filler"" weapons by *using the powerful weapon you just went in to get*?"
54270,"&gt;However, a fucking DDOS attack for his Jimquisition review? 

I have yet to see any evidence that an enraged Zelda fan did that. He can claim it for clickbait purposes, but I don't see him giving us any proof of it."
54607,"&gt;there's a difference between disagreeing with his criticism to calling him a fat fuck that should kill himself 

Yes, I couldn't agree more. Which is why it's good that the people disagreeing with him were different people from those telling him to kill himself. You make it sound like literally everyone who had an issue with his joke of a review was giving him death threats.

This reminds me of when Anita Sarkeesian was making her ""sexism in games"" videos. I saw countless people being accused of being a sexist because they had legitimate issues with her arguments and were in no way getting involved in any offensive comments. Just because some people are unhinged enough to give people death threats online doesn't somehow magically negate all criticism of the content of their videos. 

But it's sure a damn good way to attack the character of anyone who doesn't agree with you, by implying that they are involved in that."
56439,"&gt;Where did I insinuate that?

It was this bit:

&gt;there's a difference between disagreeing with his criticism to calling him a fat fuck that should kill himself

After he'd said:

&gt;How dare WE get to have an opinion on HIS opinion, right?

You're making it sound like the guy you are replying to doesn't know the difference just because he disagrees with Sterling. "
65521,"Fair point - I hadn't realised that was the case.

I guess its to rile people up so that it gets people talking about him which gets people googling him which gets people to discover his Patreon. Same effect but different method!"
