27671,"Did you watch the entire video? Well, I did. It was pretty funny.

In the 13 minutes of footage before that quote, he described Nintendo's hyper aggressive protection of its own intellectual property in the form of relentless content id flags, ignoring fair use of Nintendo game clips for illustrative purposes in critical, analytical and satirical comedy shorts.

He said they would without fail reject appeals on fair use grounds, exhaust Youtube's dispute resolution process and ultimately monetize his videos when youtube places ads in his ad free work over a few seconds of Pokemon footage.

He described this as a bizaare form of theft where his original work has become an exclusive revenue stream for Nintendo. At that point he starts jokingly advocating theft/piracy of Nintendo products.

And then we get to the rather hilarious point of the whole thing: If Nintendo files a content id claim on this video, the best case scenario is they will make ad revenue off a video which explicitly tells viewers to shoplift Nintendo games. You couldn't make it up.

Then he starts throwing in clips of GTA and various other games so other companies can file content id claims which will deadlock the entire process because now multiple copyright holders have to fight over who gets what proportion of the ad revenue. A complete waste of everyone's time and money.

Satire unfortunately appears to be dead on the internet."
