863,"While I liked the durability thing at the beginning, he makes a good point comparing mid/late game to hoarding elixirs in Final Fantasy.

Also his rant about some of the overzealous people in the Zelda community is spot on. DDoS, etc. over a review..."
1718,"I mean, there's definitely progression in the sense that enemies start dropping stronger and stronger items. Arlo's video was a good defense of it. I'm more in the middle. I like it at the start of the game but later on...I'm still evaluating how I feel about it.

I do think it's a better system than Skyrim, which results in so many weapons that become useless or feel underpowered quickly. In BoTW at least you can use early game items later on too.

That said. The game is great and I've been playing it non stop basically since I got it."
5242,"Sure, it's possible it just crashed due to overwhelmed response. But with the vitriol of some of the comments he's been getting it wouldn't surprise me if someone did."
5399,"I don't think he's claiming some orchestrated effort or anything, some random dude from this subreddit or elsewhere might have done it.

It could have been overloaded like you said, yeah.

Either way, the comments he's received have definitely been from places like this subreddit and they're really sad."
5491,"Yes, how dare he give a review based on his opinions...

The review came out a few days ago, he's responding to the outrage."
5530,"""If the reviewer doesn't like something they shouldn't review it!""

What?"
8942,His videos don't have ads. 
9728,"And now I'm a fanboy. Right.

Look, there's a difference between disagreeing with his criticism to calling him a fat fuck that should kill himself."
9772,My point is you're wrong about ad revenue. He doesn't make money from ads. 
9838,"""If he didn't like it he shouldn't have played the game.""

That is literally what the guy I responded to said. "
12195,"Look, you don't have to justify the durability thing to me. I was just confused on wtf the dude was talking about when he said if he doesn't like it he shouldn't play it. He's a reviewer. That's what he does. "
12260,"If that was a staple of the franchise sure, but it's new and I think is fine to comment on. "
13033,Great video. I think he's right about using the durability as a way to make it more enjoyable to explore. And exploration is what this game is all about. 
13433,"He explicitly said it wasn't the whole group, but if I point that out I'm being a knight or whatever.

I posted this because i found it interesting and thought it would be something to talk about.

If you want to take that and turn it into something it isn't, go ahead. I think I'm done discussing it with you. "
13617,"Link? I remember he said he was playing it and that the review wasn't going to be 10/10, but that was post launch. "
13846,"Yeah I'm with you. I liked the durability thing when I first started. I'm about halfway through the game and have started hoarding a bit more which I don't like. I think once I teach myself to just throw the fancy weapon aside I'll be fine.

People can get pretty ridiculous with their brand support. It's scary. "
13967,Thanks! I'll listen when I get the chance. 
56000,"&gt; You make it sound like literally everyone who had an issue with his joke of a review was giving him death threats.


Where did I insinuate that?

You're mischaracterizing me."
56108,He doesn't have ads on his website or youtube videos. He doesn't profit from advertising.
57023,"I was trying to get the point of the video across. But instead got called a fanboy and accused of ""knighting"" for Sterling by the person I was responding to.

I didn't mean the guy didn't know the difference, I meant he was missing the point of the video."
