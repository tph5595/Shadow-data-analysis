341,The video is ad free.
808,This video is fair criticism. Why would you not support it in the first place?
3636,He didn't actually say it was morally okay to pirate Nintendos games. That was just a bait title.
4164,"Yeah, but he didn't mean it. And yes, it is stupid."
4637,"Wait a second. You lost me. What bait review? The 7/10 score? First of all, I wasn't discussing that. Secondly that's not a bait review, at least I don't see it like that. Help me out, I have no idea what you're talking about. "
5288,"Well, look at it this way. The horror parts in RE4 and the shooting in GoW are good things, right? The weapon durability is NOT a good thing in his opinion. I think it's really easy to understand."
6174,"Yeah but 13:14 onward he admits that it's sarcasm, which basically means that he would like to pirate Nintendos games, but he doesn't, because it's not okay.

Just hear it from him."
8972,7/10 is not dragging it through the mud ffs.
12173,You can refill ammo. You can't repair most weapons in this game.
12997,"Well Jim's point was that he doesn't want to pick up new ones, he just wants to use the old one. And are you suggesting that you're always going to get a weapon as good as the one you lost. Unlikely, when even the best weapons break easily to small enemies."
15052,See 13:04 of the original video.
15189,"Yeah, but how about instead of getting new weapons and replacements all the time, you could just keep the old ones, and then take the new ones if you want? Wouldn't that been a much better way to do it?

quickedit: grammer"
15828,"This game is barely a survival game in the first place. Food items are healing items, so there's no hunger or thirst stat (which is good). If you reach a bit, you can include stamina as a survival game thing.

Besides, making do with what you have is not a good excuse since the game throws weapon after weapon at you, so you never have a problem anyway. That makes the weapons breaking pointless."
16749,"My last thoughts on this, probably.

1. Aesthetics of a weapon don't really count as not pointless. (Petty)
2. The big problem of varied movesets is that if you don't like the moveset, it's not fun. That's why for example being forced into using spears could annoy people."
22906,"You can view it as that, yes. I'm not smart enough to win this battle, so I'm just gonna say this. I think weapon durability shouldn't exist, and the weapons shouldn't be built around it.

BUT. It could still be way more balanced. They need to nerf and buff some things."
