15124,Ones with higher durability have a diamond symbol in the corner.
18211,The last one. 
18249,"You can't max out both hearts and stamina. If you max out Stamina, you will have 27 hearts."
18363,Spawning you outside of the castle would require altering your save file.
22925,"Nope, go for it."
26599,Thirteen total. u/Finaldzn: Only red hearts matter; no buffs or extra hearts count.
26636,It's real life now. 
27282,"11 x 19 9/16 inches. Not a standard frame size, unfortunately. 12x20 would be the best fit."
30780,"The physical map is very artistic, and not very useful for playing the game. If you like decorations and trinkets, the special edition is good. If that's not your thing, the most utility you get is a Sheikah Slate carrying case, which might not be worth the extra $40-100 dollars to you."
31815,The Switch is region-free. 
34604,"That is basically just a switch that has to turn on. One variable being changed from false to true. Changing your save file so that it loads you to a totally different area requires a more complex programming solution. On the other hand, the player already has the option to ""leave this map"" so the solution isn't necessary. "
37804,"10 upgrades, or two full circles."
37984,"If it sounds like I'm trying to exaggerate how difficult it is, that's not my intention. It wouldn't be difficult, just more complex than doing what it does now: Load your save from immediately before you fight Ganon, but with the ""post-Ganon"" bonuses turned on. 

As far as I'm aware, it doesn't track what you consumed in the fight since it resets to your last save (unless it records it somewhere for you to look at later?)"
38555,"You have to outlast the horse's stamina with your own. With many horses, that requires a few stamina upgrades. In the absence of those, you can use stamina recovery food/elixers while soothing the horse."
38626,I don't think they forgot. I think that is their intention.
38763,"I don't know the answers but this

&gt;an attack up x5 **savage Lynel bow** with bomb arrows out of an **ancient bow** with a 3 attack food buff?

Is two different bows.

"
38943,"If you have done all shrine quests, and his non-shrine side quest, try visiting all of his locations to verify that he isn't there. Go to his journal and visit every location. That should fix it."
39024,"You can find which shrine quests are his by finding his little hut and reading his journal. The most likely one you have missed is the Shrine of Courage one. Talking to him there will complete the quest. 

Mind that he has one non-shrine sidequest as well, which can be found in his journal."
46659,Literally a cold thing casting a shadow. Look nearby.
46702,Hearty bass are pretty plentiful in the lake beneath the Faron bridge.
51667,"Lol, of all the things you've tried, none of them involve *casting a shadow*.

Idk what u/zom6ie_roxas is talking about. When the pedestal lights up, hold a snowball so that its shadow is on the pedestal.

Edit: like this http://imgur.com/a/DAmYu "
54070,I heard some folks at one of the stables in the south tell of a Horse God... maybe it can help you?
66068,It's about 11 1/2 by 19 9/16. A 12 x 20 frame would be your best bet. Edit: Inches.
66688,Have you read the journal of various worries?
129197,"A bit late on this, but I have a hypothesis regarding one area of the game. There is an island off the west coast of the Lost Woods, with a single tree and some bones. I've been able to consistently generate blood moons by going there, waiting until night, then killing all of the Stals that spawn. Blood moon next night.

If you try this and it works for you could you let me know please?"
130543,"The times I've done it, I went there and camped until night, but that was because It's a little way from the nearest shrine.

Afterward, when doing the blood moon quest, I just warped back and camped again."
