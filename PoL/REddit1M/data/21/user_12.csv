4552,Headshots! Easy to chain headshots once you get one
4744,"This guy had some great guides for all the dragons.

Sometimes they don't spawn. More often than not, saving and restarting my console would get them to spawn. Otherwise, I guess you have to leave the area and go back. 




To get to these areas, I'd spawn on top of death mountain or on top of mount lanayrus and glide down to the spots.  Another one of his posts has images showing exactly where he camped"
22403,Do you guys actually get better performance when playing on the wii u gamepad? I've seen people say this before. I'm playin on it now for the first time and it's performance seems exactly the same to me. 
29213,"yeah, you can shoot an arrow at the ground next to them so they'll stop running in circles and investigate. **(as chumba44 pointed out, it's even better to just stasis them)** that should make the initial headshot easier. after the first headshot, they fall on the ground, then they get up and stand still for a few seconds. "
32897,always forget about stasis! took me forever to remember i didn't have to try swimming everywhere because of cryonis. 
33095,"i forget what the area is called, but it's near the rito village where all of those weird looking trees/inverted-mushrooms are. it's before the stable and before tabantha bridge.... ""Hyrule Ridge"" might be what it's called. "
33209,"it seems like it's most common for Zora to be first and Gerudo to be last. not sure about the middle though.

for me, it was Zora, Rito, Gerudo, Goron"
33342,"you can get a star fragment from a quest at Outskirt Stable - talk to the lady in the pink dress.


idk if they spawn nightly, but i have seen quite a few fall (but didn't collect them all). "
33493,"https://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/631516-wii-u/71790287


there's a thread about that error code. seems like it's related to the console, not the game (or the game is dirty)."
33610,they only seem to grow on cliffs. it's annoying! 
33665,it does alter the save file though. it adds a star to acknowledge that you beat ganon once
33825,i don't think it woudl be worth all that work! lol
33968,"it's easier to watch the icon near the minimap. if you're heading towards it, the entire icon will light up. if you're heading slightly off, only a portion of it will light up.


i'm not 100% this works, but to tell if it's above or below you, i think you can try jumping. if it's above you, the icon will light up as you're jumping. if it's below you, the icon will light up as you're falling. "
34062,"there's a quest from a girl in a pink dress at outskirt stable, the reward is a star fragment. "
34198,"i do wish i went their earlier. it's so easy to dodge the guardian's lasers, and the enemies inside are just normal moblins and lizalfos... definitely the coolest ""dungeon"" of the game though, even though there were no puzzles. "
34654,"with the gerudo one, your charged attacks will also do an area-of-effect lightning attack. the goron one creates a forcefield around you while you're holding L, and if you get hit it will block it (and i think deflect the attack). i find myself using the gerudo one the least, but that's because i don't really like to take the time to charge up my attacks ever.


as for the order, i wouldn't worry about it too much. it's really minor. i would just play the game, explore, go to cool things that you see, and let it take you in whichever order it does. if you can't decide where to go first, then stand on one of the sheikah towers and look all around you. go whichever way you think looks the coolest (or wherever you see the most shrines). "
34949,"i'm sure they put you right in front so you could fight ganon again immediately anyway. otherwise, that programming solution is as easy as using the exact same function that lets you ""leave this map"" (or warps you anywhere for that matter.)


also, it alters the save file in other ways. i'm pretty sure it saves which weapons you broke during the fight, how many arrows you used, etc. "
44472,np. i remember taking my picture and it being a shit ton of them flying all over!
44534,good point. i probably got about 6 of them in 140 hours of playing. but i saw a bunch of them landing that i didn't bother tracking down cus they were just too far away. but i also had more than i've needed so far.
