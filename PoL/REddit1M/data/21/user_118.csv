61092,Anyone gone under 43s in the shield surfing minigame? What is the reward? I am wondering how profitable it is to farm rupees because with a bit more practice i think i can make this consistent. Obviously other minigames are faster for grinding money but this is more fun for me.

61457,I was given the quest just fine and I'd already beaten the game and found it at that point. Have you talked to him during the day in the village?
