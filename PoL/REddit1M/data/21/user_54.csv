23534,I haven't gotten an error code at all yet.

I would say just the cliffs like you're saying. I've been collecting a few while I go for all of the shrines in the background."
23997,"Yes! To get Dinraal's super easy. Just warp to Hebra Tower and jump off towards hyrule castle just glide until the weather changes and you technically move to the next zone. Then look left and Dinraal should spawn no problem just glide backwards a bit and land on one of the snowy cliffs and wait for her to fly underneath you. Just glide down and fire! I waited till morning so you might want to do that.


For Naydra you want to wait for night and warp to Mt Lanayru if you have the shrine open. Walk down the mountain a little bit and wait for around 11:00 or 12:00 the moment you see her spawn sprint up the mountain and boom Naydra!"
51441,There should be 2 little holes right at the cliff edge. (It's a real big pain in the ass by the way) But get a snowball big enough to cover the pedestal. Then put it into the small hole in the ground and it should stay there. Stasis it and hit it once to get it to move where you want. Then it's just a matter of waiting. And waiting. A very long time.
