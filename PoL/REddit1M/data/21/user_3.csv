1912,"I went to Hyrule Castle early like after finishing my third Divine Beast and lemme tell you, I highly recommend it. The scope and atmosphere of it is just too amazing to only experience at the ending, and the whole thing is massive. 

I ended up leaving after getting some items from there (another point, the weapons you find are incredible!)

Spoilers, 

I found the Hylian Shield, does it break like all other shields? Or is it indestructible? "
3735,"The other commentator covered cooking regular food pretty well, but I'll help you with Elixirs as you probably have some monster parts. 

Elixirs are a bit complicated and I haven't gotten the perfect hang of them yet, but generally you mix a monster part like a Bokoblin horn or Moblin horn in with a critter and you'll get a mild potion. Seems simple enough, right? However these potions are pretty weak and have little duration so you have to mess around a bit more. By adding more critters with the same effect into a potion, I've gotten some high strength elixirs, and to increase the duration, you want to throw in some rarer, high value monster parts (like from the big monsters and all). 


Imo Elixirs are a lot more useful for status effects as you can get some potions that have way higher durations than most food."
3856,Sweet thanks! It's a very tanky shield but I think I'll just use my other shields for now cause I like how they look and they've lasted a long time as well. 
17213,"Hmm yeah it can get difficult, I bought Stealth armor a bit before I headed to the main story so that really helped with getting a lot of bugs and critters. As far as I can tell monster parts are neutral. 

You can find a lot of them underneath rocks or just flying about like butterflies. When you get to wetlands you'll also find a lot of frogs which you can use too"
17534,"That's crazy good, so pretty near unbreakable in comparison. Still, I plan on using my other shields simply cuz I love their designs, thanks anyways!"

42270,"Definitely, it was so badass hearing the music playing in the background while scaling the outside of the castle, finding the dungeon and subsequently the Hylian Shield was a great experience, after getting to Zelda's room and reading her journal. Can't wait till I reach the 4th Divine beast, I'm gonna storm the castle once more with some bomb arrows hahaha"
