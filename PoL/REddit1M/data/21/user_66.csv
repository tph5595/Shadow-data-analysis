31737,Is the most common route for getting Divine Beasts Zora-&gt;Gerudo-&gt;Rito-&gt;Goron?
34288,"As far as I know the Zora one revives you when you die+yellow hearts, Rito is the best one, letting you fly high into the sky, but what do the rest do? About to do the Zora one, but not sure whether to go Gerudo (Do all the stuff South then go North) or go Goron (Do everything in West then go East)"
