I noticed a vendor had appeared afterwards who sold rare pieces of armour that was otherwise only available from select shrine rewards. I do wonder if they were only available because I'd already unlocked them myself, as the Hylian Shield wasn't available when I last checked but I don't recall if I'd even found it yet at the time."

It can also be reacquired from Tarrey Town, but I think you need to complete the associated side-quests and help fully build it first."
