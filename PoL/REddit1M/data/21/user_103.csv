47322,"This is a super stupid question, but how do I play the game? I've done roughly 8 shrines and I've found myself just running around exploring and trying to find towers and other shrines to activate. I feel like I have severely underpowered everything, there's no enemy that doesn't kill me in one hit. I think I just don't really have a feeling of moving forward that I had in other Zelda games."
53189,Thanks for the reply. I'm doing a no-guide run so I was just wondering if there are certain towns that have the best gear? I've found around three or four towns and none of them had weapons/armor.

70013,"Didn't get touched at all in the first half where all you have to do is dodge his attacks and slash at him. It's the platforms that totally wrecked me. My weapons are in the 10-18 range with a single 34 sword (the flame sword that's being guarded on a tower. I just flew in, grabbed it, and flew out, hehe).

And the ice blocks is completely new news to me. How would I had been able to use them against him? I usually follow a guide and this is the first time I'm pretty much just going in cold."
