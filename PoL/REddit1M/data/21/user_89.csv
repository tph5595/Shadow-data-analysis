41880,Could have purchased the photo then used the slate to track it down and take your own picture.
42401,And certain bows have more natural durability than others. Experimentation is really the only way to find out.
42603,Check the book near the door in Impa's house. The entries should seem familiar. Try to find out the ones which you don't know yet/haven't done.
42815,"Exploration will lead you to the shrines/shrine quests. Its also extremely likely that a few of the quests lead to shrines you have already found. Speaking to the quest giver NPC will just auto complete the shrine quest in that case. I find the most common one seems to be in the bazaar area. Just try going to all settlements/horse stables and speak to all NPCs. You're bound to find the majority of the shrine quests you might have missed.

Korok seed number is great, have you been spending them? Thats quite a few upgrades. Still, there's plenty left to find in the world, keep your eyes open for anything suspicious, 9 times out of 10 its a korok."
43770,Think I had about the amount you had when I entered post-game but  now I'm at about 250.
44546,"1) Yes it breaks.

2) Its a long process. I'll give the hint of Hateno Village being the starting place.

3) They're a rare drop, keep trying. Other than that some shrines have them in chests."
44720,"Pretty much every item except food is used for an upgrade at some point.

Other than jewelry as others have said if you want to upgrade the amiibo sets you'll need a bunch of ore. That said you can still sell a bunch its pretty easy to find ore when you need it. Mark down the locations of Talus' on your map and return after each blood moon and you will never ever have a problem with ore and have plenty extra to sell.

I didn't do this until way late in the game, upgraded my amiibo sets and I still had a bunch left over."
44986,Thats usually the one people miss just because its only available at night.
57523,"It could be you're in a location that is always stormy until certain conditions are met. Spoilers on the locations. [The two I know of are someplace in the Faron region and another west of Central Hyrule and north of Satori Mountain. The Faron region relates to a Kass quest. Upon completion of the quest in the area the stormy weather will go away.](/spoilers)

Sorry if that doesn't answer the question, all I know is that waiting around a fire does advance weather in normal conditions and these are the only places I can think of unless there is another which I haven't found yet."
57622,I know the one which is part of the Zora questline is always a basic Lynel. Other than that you can use the search function if you have a picture of them. If you don't have a picture then go to the Hateno lab to buy them.
57680,Yeah they do. I was confused myself because I used an ability twice and noticed it didn't recharge. Kinda odd they chose to make it so they only recharge when fully used.
57746,Pretty much nothing in the game is one time only. Don't think you can get a second at the same time but once its gone you definitely can.
57879,If you follow the main quest-line you will face balanced foes and find good gear to help you get started. Other than that once you feel prepared just head off on your own and do whatever floats your boat.
58009,Be sure to take a picture of any creature you might need so you can locate them easier.
64036,"There's honestly never reason to grind out rupees in the game other than to get things slightly quicker than usual. Killing high level mobs gives good gear to use alongside good parts which can be sold, talus' are a great source of income and hinox's are a great source of weapons. Exploration and finding hidden chests usually results in a gold/silver rupee.

I will agree that surfing in the game is incredibly fun and out of all the ways to grind rupees that is definitely the best one/most fun."
69819,"Did you use the ice blocks to knock WB ganon down? Also, after fighting for a little while did you pick up what each windup meant? (As in knowing what attack he is using) Picking up an enemy's fighting style helps in knowing how to properly dodge their attacks. I know that the platforms do make it difficult but if you used arrows I'm guessing you sniped him down.

I'd say you used an average amount of arrows if your gear is only suited for that area (thinking your attack values range is approximately 20 for your weapons, right?) However I think with proper dodging techniques you could have gotten by without wasting any fairies."
70014,Sometimes while cooking you'll perform a 'critical' (best way to describe it I think) and your food will end up being better than the ingredients you use to make it. It's easy to see when you cook the same thing over and over
70114,You'll need to teleport back on from the world map. I had the issue where my main quest marker was blocking my cursor from being over the divine beast so you might need to change the marker to some other quest.
70156,Symin does it. I think you have to do a little quest if you haven't done so already.
75790,I didn't get it until the second time I fought him but you can stasis the cubes and hit them until the arrow gets to about orange and it'll hit him down. I always thought it would break the cubes but nope.
75864,Maybe you used a dragon part somehow by accident? Lol not sure what else could cause the huge difference
