35306,"During the Making of BotW videos they actively talk about adding multiple languages to the game to encourage players to try a different one (English studies is their example).

How do you actually actively *change* the language? Or did they forget that's not possible without changing the account/Switch's region?"

I mean I'd like to, but am I really going to make another save file on another temporary account just for the voice acting? And if in the future I *do* want a specific language, I won't be able to play it on my main account?

Weird design choice."
