5596,"One of the memories takes you to the ""park"" with the statue of a horse. I passed through it on the way north before I even heard about it. It made perfect sense. Search around that area. It tends to wander through the area early in the morning. I don't think it comes at night or when it rains (can confirm from experience). One bright sunny morning at exactly 8 am, after it stormed the day before and me sitting around all night, it strolled in front of me. Make sure you have stealth potions and stamina potions if you haven't leveled up your stamina (that's what I used since I only have been leveling my health). My boyfriend tried without using a stealth potion because he didn't make one...it kept running away.

Edit: We both found it walking up the road (uphill) that wraps around a big tree. The statue is on a hilltop."
5894,Yup! And don't forget to talk to Toffa after you catch it. You will get something special for the horsey!
