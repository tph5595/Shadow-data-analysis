32293,Where can I easily find rainbow pigeons? They're the only animal I'm missing in the compendium 
32840,They spawn pretty frequently along the path up mt lanayru. Another trick you can do is use ice arrows or ice weapons on normal chu jelly to turn it into white jelly 
36820,Hey thanks I found a bunch of them at hyrule ridge
37890,Sidequest spoiler: If you do the sidequest with the sheikah ball in kakariko you fight a yiga with a windcleaver as part of the quest.
38501,"If you want speed boost potions, I think fleet lotus seeds are easier to get since you don't have to climb to find them. I think they're found in the zora region"
38588,10 upgrades or 3 full rings total
38653,Maybe the dlc will add 3 more heart containers. I know they're adding at least 1 dungeon so there's hope
38982,Then I think you'll just have to find one randomly. I seem to get attacked by yiga more often when traveling along main roads on foot
42442,"Yeah, I guess I could have"
56406,"All of the lynels in my game seem to have been replaced by white-maned lynels and even a silver lynel at the coliseum. Is it still possible to acquire a mighty lynel sword, lynel crusher, lynel spear, mighty lynel bow, and mighty lynel shield? The ones I've found only have savage gear. "
56749,I think you can get another rarely from the amiibo
57044,"I think the only animals you can ride are deer, bears, and horses"
57782,"Yeah the one near the zoras is red but it only carries the sword, shield, and bow afaik "
