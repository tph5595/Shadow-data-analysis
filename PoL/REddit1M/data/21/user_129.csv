85677,"Yes, for the shrine quest I literally set a fire up near the pedestal and constantly slept to Night until the blood moon came. Took about four or five tries. I have also read that killing a certain number of enemies can trigger the blood moon, but I don't think this is true. I have killed hundreds of enemies and no blood moon came. "
85890,Just did the same thing. I framed mine. Couldn't find a 12x20 frame locally so I bought a 16x20 and got a matte that was a similar color of the map and actually came out nice. Then I took the back off and put a piece of plexi glass from Home Depot on it. This allowed it to be viewed from both sides.
86235,"[Down in the Faron region, south east of the Highland Lake is the Horse God. Like the fairies, you must sacrifice about 1000 rupees and he will gain full power. He will only revive your horse if the horse died from forces out of your control. Meaning, suicide or puposly killing your horse and he will not help.] (/spoiler)"
86381,Yes I received two in between 4 or 5 scans.
86430,"If you're on  the switch, sleep mode is amazing. Instant on and off and the game literally just pauses while in sleep mode. "
86630,[Between 4:00 pm and 5:00 pm pick up the snow ball and position yourself so that the shadow of the snowball above your head covers the center circle of the pedestal. This will open the shrine.] (/spoiler)
86842,I agree with this statement. Out of 10 flying guardians they dropped 6 of them. 
86887,No you can not. The game will not let you register anything but a horse at a stable. And going to those mini games they will say you can not use your current mount.
87042,"Its tied to your profile. If you had set your profile up in japan, the game would play in Japanese. "
87227,"I went:

Zora

Gerudo

Rito

Goron

Although I felt Goron was easiest, zora was next, rito was the second hardest, and gerudo to be the most difficult. But know they were all pretty easy. 

And I am upset that Goron and Rito were essentially the same dungeon."
87405,Unfortunately there isn't one. The other side of the coin is that electrical attacks will shock enemies causing them to drop all gear. 
87477,"You can either get all 30 hearts with two stamina wheels and two parts of a new wheel 

or

three wheels and 22 hearts"
96804,No you can only have 30 hearts max including temporary hearts
97485,I personally have found no reason for three wheels. So I max my hearts out 
103142,"Ignore the main quest for a few hours. Jump off the plateau and just discover. You will find good weapons, armors, and shields that will make the main quest a lot easier. I have over 100 hours into the game and still am finding new things. "
