If you want to make rupees, I suggest doing Snowling (Snowball Bowling). Located at Pondo's Lodge. A stone throw from the Hebra Tower in the North East direction. Literally almost at the base of the tower. Hebra Mountains is the North Western part of the map.

You pay 20 rupees and you can easily get a strike and make 300 Rupees consistently."

Instant revive, then ultimate blocks, power damaging attack, and finally extra height (will help with activating bow-mo, getting distance for gliding, and solving puzzles more easily)"
