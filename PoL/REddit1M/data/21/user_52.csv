23209,Are any Wii U users getting an error code? My game suddenly started crashing whenever I go near a town or objective a few days ago. I'm getting error code 150-1031
46261,I took the disc back to GameStop and they gave me a new one. It works! Apparently there is an issue where micro fractures sometimes cause the error.
