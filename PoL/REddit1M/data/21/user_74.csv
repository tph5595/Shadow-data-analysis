34860,"I have questions about damage. 

Does the Ancient Proficiency bonus stack with attack bonus from food? What are the numbers for each? 

Does the Barbarian armor stack with food, and again how much for each? 

How is weapon damage calculated for bows, specifically bomb arrows, and does it apply the buffs from Barbarian armor and Ancient armor (for the ancient bow?)

If Ancient armor and food stack, and apply to bows, does that mean that the strongest hit in the game, outside of ancient arrows, is an attack up x5 savage Lynel bow with bomb arrows out of an ancient bow with a 3 attack food buff? I'd be interested to see the math on how hard that hits. "

46280,Thanks! Do you know if ancient proficiency applies to guardian weapons? 
68624,"Is the mega buff from monster extract random? I did 4 bananas + extract twice, and got +3 attack for half an hour and +3 attack for 1 minute. "
