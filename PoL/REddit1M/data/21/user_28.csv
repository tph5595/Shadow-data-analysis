10287,"Does anyone know how I can get this underwater Star Fragment? http://imgur.com/tmtjrg0

I've been stalking it for 20 minutes hoping it washes up on shore, but shore-ly there must be a way to dive or get it out of the water. It's not metallic, sadly."
11124,Bombs don't even seem to affect it.
11512,It's by Boneyard Bridge east of Hyrule Castle.
12548,I doubt it will be there for you. It's from a falling star.
14227,There is a chest nearby. Good thought
15244,"Had to find a part of the shore that had a workable slope, but after about 15 minutes I was able to 'fish' it up using a treasure chest haha"

35476,I wanted the Star Fragment lol. This is the second one I've seen in like 30 hours of play
