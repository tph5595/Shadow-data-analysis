Edit: ignore what I said! :P what the other person told you is right, you have to go look for her but I forgot what part of the map that was when I found the horse."
2558,"Just don't mix insects and enemy parts with food items, you end up creating a plate of ""dubious food"" and it's censored lol. Also if you want your dish to have a certain special effect, group the foods with that ability together cause if you just put things in randomly, you don't get the effect. "
2689,Does anyone know what electric wizzrobes are weak to? I can't climb the tower!
3360,Any specific kind?? :)
27012,Thanks for the tip! It's just so frustrating because I keep getting the attention from all 3. Crossing my fingers I can get it done soon :/
27066,I'll keep that in mind! So elemental arrows and headshots should be my strategy? 
27197,Thanks for the advice :) I guess my strategy is going to be headshots and elemental arrows. I just wish there wasn't 3 of them to fight! So annoying.
27308,Does anyone know if star fragments land nightly? And perhaps even around what time they show up?
94317,"Aww man there's a flying ability?! I haven't gotten around to battling any of the divine beasts cause to be honest, I'm a chicken :P have you?"
94508,I haven't battled any of the 4 beasts yet though lol :P I'm intimidated!  How hard was beating the bird? Any tips?
95317,Wow thanks! I'm definitely gonna try that out :) I've never thought to use any of the other runes (except the bombs) against any enemy ...I didn't think they worked for some reason... I'm an idiot lol. 
95848,That's what's happening to me!! Almost seems like they stopped falling on purpose cause they knew I was waiting lol. I've only collected ONE in the many hours I've been playing :/
