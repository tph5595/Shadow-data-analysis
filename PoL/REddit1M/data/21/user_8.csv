3534,"I wouldn't worry too much about it; you'll get more resources at a very steady rate.  I highly encourage you experiment.  But here are the basics:

* The games shows you how many hearts something heals raw (example, an Apple heals 1/2 heart).  If you cook something, it will almost always be better than if you left it raw.  So if you cook a single apple, you'll get a Baked Apple, which heals 1 heart.

* The ingredient tells you what effect it has when cooked.  Rushrooms increase speed, Razorshrooms increase attack, Staminoka Bass replenish stamina.  However, cooking can only lead to a single effect.  So if you tried to cook Razorshrooms and Rushrooms together, they would cancel each other out and you'd just get a food dish that heals you with no additional attributes.

* Some ingredients just heal you, like meat, Hyrule Bass, Hylian Herbs, Apples, Hylian Mushrooms, etc.  Cook them all together to make a dish that heals you for a lot of hearts, or mix them in with an ""effect"" ingredient to get a bit of both.

* Monster parts + certain bugs will create elixirs, depending on what you mix together

*  Anything with ""Hearty"" in the name (hearty salmon, hearty radish, hearty truffle, hearty bass) will heal you for full when cooked and give you bonus hearts.  These you should just cook one by one, without mixing anything with them"
