9041,"there are 3 tiers of guardian weapons: normal, + and ++. They come from minor, modest and major tests of strength respectively. In other words, ++ is the highest quality of guardian weapons.

I believe the guardian shield works on the laser of guardian scouts (the mini guardian in shrines), but actual guardians (stalkers, flying, turrets) are unaffected. The ancient shield from akkala tech lab however does perfectly reflect guardian shots without eating too much durability."

9181,yellow diamond is strictly better
9762,"in general, the quality of weapon drops improves with the amount of shrines you have conquered. Hinoxes usually carry about 3 standard series weapons (AKA traveler/soldier/knight/royal weapon depending on how many shrines you have). Shrine chests contain good weapons most of the time. Test of Strength shrines are a good source for very high damage weapons, but they quickly break so use them only when necessary (they are also farmable since guardian scouts respawn every blood moon). Barbarian Armor (you get it in various shrines, I can tell you where if you want me to) increases your atk power by 30%, you can also try to brew +3 atk elixirs for the same purpose. Ancient armor (bought from akkala ancient tech lab) gives specific types of weapons (ancient weapons) a 50% damage boost once you activate its set bonus (aka leveling it up twice with fairy fountains). The Coliseum east from the Great Plateau houses lots of basic enemies carrying all elemental melee weapons. Finally, if you're a little bit crazy and trust in your skills, Lynels drop ridiculously good weapons."
