17816,"I'll try to keep these spoilers light, but it's about the end. [I just beat the game and I'm wondering how ""endgame"" works. I haven't tried loading back into the game yet cause I don't want to mess up any saves. Can you load into a post-end world to keep doing shrines and finishing all the quests and exploring the ton I haven't finished yet? Or do I just load an earlier save, leave Hyrule castle, and keep playing as if I haven't beaten the game yet?](/spoiler)"
