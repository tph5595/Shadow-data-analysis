30712,"This isn't an in game question but I was wondering if the ""Special Edition"" (not the master edition) is worth it? Is there anything I'll really miss out on? I want to play the game using a physical map but would I be better off just buying the guide &amp; DLC?"
31205,"Thanks a bunch. If it was the initial $99 I would have bought it immediately, but scalpers have raised it quite a bit. I think I'd rather collect some of the older amiibo instead. Do you happen to know if a Japanese version of this game would be regionlocked? "
