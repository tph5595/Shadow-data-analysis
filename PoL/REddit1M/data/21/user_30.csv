12585,"There's no measurement of distance i can give you here - all i can say is to watch as you get closer because 3 bars can drop to two quite sneakily. That usually means you need to turn slightly. You'll get used to it the more you do it.

As a handy example, use Sha Gehma Shrine (far north Tabantha Tundra) as you can see it for miles before you get it on the radar :)"
