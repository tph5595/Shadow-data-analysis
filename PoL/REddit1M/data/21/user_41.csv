18759,If you go to your map there's an option to exit the area and it'll drop you outside the castle.
18819,You can switch them if you don't like your choice
18859,I found a lot while doing my korok run in the Ridgeland Tower region
24150,Your best bet is to save scum for the rare amiibo gear - save just before you use the amiibo and reload if you don't get what you want. Also make sure you're doing it near a stable - the first time I got Epona I was somewhere on a cliff and couldn't get her to a stable.
27878,"Unless they show up on random parts of the map where you can't see them, absolutely not. I was farming them because I wanted to upgrade an outfit that called for 12 and it took forever. I tried the ""sit on a tall central mountain"" method and it took me weeks (Hyrule time) to get one"
29015,Only the amiibo exclusive outfits need 12 to fully upgrade (and the Sheik mask alone needs 10). I'd recommend getting 3 to upgrade some special armor you get when you've completed a certain task. 3 are easy to get; there are 2 side quests at Woodland Stable and if you feed every dog you meet in the game they'll lead you to 3 more.
36331,Feed any dog 4-5 pieces of food and he'll bring you to a very well concealed chest. I know star fragments came from the stable that's covered in snow in the northwest and the dog in the coastal village in the south east. I forget where the other one came from
37821,"They are used for armor upgrades, but honestly they're pretty easy to farm. There's one cave in the south east that I usually walk out of with a diamond and half a dozen topaz/rubies/sapphires and it respawns every couple of hours. Whenever I'm low on rupees I sell gems as they're the easiest things to reacquire."
37996,"I haven't gotten him to return either. I've done all of the shrines but my page says I'm still missing 3 shrine quests, so I guess maybe I didn't trigger all of his..?"
38043,"Ice arrows and frostblades should, as well"
38206,I went Zora-Goron-Gerudo-Rito. One of my room mates went Rito-Zora-Gerudo-Goron and the other went Zora-Rito-Gerudo-Goron
38522,Maybe DLC will have 12 more shrines
111667,"You can do it right away but they can be finicky about where you place it, you have to make sure it's right in front of their face"
