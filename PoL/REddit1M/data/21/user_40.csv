18254,"It loads you directly before you fight Ganon again, so you'd have to exit the castle and then you can continue to do shrines and whatnot. Its kind of annoying - couldn't they have spawned you right outside the castle itself!?"
18360,"Is there a place where you can easily get Rushrooms? Its for a sidequest.

I know the cold mountainous areas around Gerudo desert have them on cliffs, just wondering if there's an easier way. I already have it tagged on my Sensor. "
18435,"Did you upgrade any of your stamina using the Spirit orbs? If you upgraded it 3 times, then that's what the problem is.

I believe there's a way to respec Link's hearts/stamina somewhere in Hatero, but I haven't found it yet. "
18489,"I don't think so. I've tried many times and they always attack me
"
27276,"I haven't gotten any errors.

Did you download it or get a physical copy? If you downloaded it, you might have to reinstall, but I think that deletes your save file. "
27409,"I'm having trouble finding Windcleaver (for a sidequest). I've beaten the Yiga hideout.

I know the bigger Yiga warriors can spawn in the overworld, but the last time I've seen one was like 15+ game hours ago. Anyone know of any reliable spawning spots for them? "
28284,"Maybe you can put a little border around it, or something?"
28889,"Yeah, I've found one fragment in my 40+ total hours of playtime. I don't think I'm going to bother collecting all 12 for that...haha"
30643,"You...you can feed the dogs!?

The only thing missing is the ability to pet them - Nintendo dropped the ball on that one! 

But thanks! "
38177,"Yeah, I did that one already before I knew I needed a windcleaver. "
47285,"I only have 80 Korok seeds. If I come across them as I travel, fine...but I'm not going to go out looking for 820 more seeds. Screw that. "
47413,"I tried that, and the answer is no...for all 3 different dragons. "
94835,"Thanks! Finally found one on the road along the north side of the Great Plateau. He wouldn't spawn while I was on the horse, so I had to walk around on foot. "
