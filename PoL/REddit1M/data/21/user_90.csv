41896,"Can someone give me a hint as to how I'm supposed to initiate the shrine quest involving the orb in Impa's house? I've talked to everyone in the village and done every dialogue option Impa and Paya give me when I speak to them. I just can't figure it, but I don't want to just look at guide and figure it out."
44726,Thank you! I thought it was this but I thought I'd done every side quest. Turns out the last one I needed was the firefly girl. I never tried talking to her at night.
