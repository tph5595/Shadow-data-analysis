47502,Nope don't believe you can. 
47766,"The point is to get lost and explore. You'll find so much without even trying. If you're dying a lot, seek out shrines and level up your hearts. Visit the towns and get new gear. Collect EVERYTHING and make elixirs and food that boost your health, attack, or defense. Don't worry so much about what you have to do because that is simple. Beat Ganon. The path to that end goal is up to you. 

If you do want to feel like you're progressing the story, start doing the ancient beasts and progress the main quest. 

My point is, have fun being lost."
