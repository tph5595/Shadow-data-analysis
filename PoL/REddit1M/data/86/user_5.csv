My least favorite challenge of the game as well."

Just noticed that it does include the new champions. You'll need to defeat a divine beast to get the good stuff."

Dragons only spawn after you complete the ""Seek Out Impa"" quest."
55088,Have you activated the three springs? The dragons don't spawn regularly until after that.

In general, if you do something, like complete a Shrine Quest, without talking to the person who was supposed to send you on a shrine quest, it's also NBD. When you talk to them, they just introduce the shrine quest and it's instantly completed. No real need to worry about doing things in the wrong order in BOTW."

- I stopped carrying a torch around when I realized any wooden weapon functions the same way. A bobokin club is then both my melee weapon and torch. I try to keep one wooden weapon for this reason (two-handers also work as torches).
- With the Master Sword, I keep about 50:50 one- to two-handed weapons. The master sword is my go-to one-hander. Pre-master sword I kept a higher ratio, closer to 2:1 in favor of one-handed weapons. 
- With lots of weapon spots, I also hold onto a spear. With few spots, I'd drop it.
- I like to have one fire weapon and one ice weapon as well. Those are very handy."
