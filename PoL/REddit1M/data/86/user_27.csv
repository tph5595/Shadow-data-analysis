But if you need to free up inventory space I'd get rid of it and just pick up the next you find.

The torch is definitely not needed - like others said fire arrows usually work but I find it is easy to get another torch, but most of the time other wooden weapons will work anyway."
218415,I bought the DLC before I started and I think it's great - I love having the ability to see where I've walked on the map but also I've come across a couple of really helpful items already that were in the DLC.
