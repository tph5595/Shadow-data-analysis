460471,"I once killed the wolf, and the Korok got stuck cowering in fear. Would not respond to me at all, even coming right up to him. I was so angry because I had already failed that trial so many times. I gave up and looked it up; apparently the only strategy is to shoot the wolf. I guess you could kite it far enough away from the little korok that you can kill it without much commotion, but then you risk separating from the korok and getting ""lost"".

Stupid mission."
