297331,"Okay so I'm very new still. I'm stumbled upon some things I was clearly not supposed to already reach, but gamewise I have recovered two memories, got a horse, and done maybe a dozen shrines.

Anyway: I keep trying to figure out what I should sell and buy. Arrows seem super expensive. Do I want that house in the village for 3K rupees? I have 1K now, and know not to sell my ancient parts. But should I just sell my gems and extra monster parts and cooked food to get the house? Also, what armor set should I be trying to get? I have the climber's bandana and my champion tunic.

Final thing; I have the DLC, but how do I use it? It said there would be more chests on the Great Plateau, but I never found them. Is it just the Outpost Ruins quests now?

I'd love just like a basic here's how to get through your first divine beast minimal spoiler guide."
297462,Someone please answer this!
365531,"Hahaha, I found that fairy shrine on my own, and upgraded my climber's bandana because it was the only armor I had other than the warm doublet. Then I talked to the guy and he made me go back and take a picture!

I may have already bought the house... FWIW the builders are super cute. I also recently bought an actual house so maybe it'd just on my mind. But you're right, it was a lot of rupees.

I wasn't sure about the stealth armor because it was in the ""starting area"" (kind of) and didn't have a whole lot of protection. I also just realized that you don't really run out of armor space, so I'll go buy it.

Thanks for the advice! It's just what I was looking for."
374538,"Ah! I knew there had to be tiers to the armor sets. Thank you! I've been limping along with what I've been given as quest rewards or found in chests, I have the Champion's Tunic, Climber's Bandana, Climber's Pants, and the Warm Doublet.

I really appreciated how ""studly"" I was to buy the house, hahaha. That was cute. I know it was expensive, but I wanted the armor racks!"
374740,"This is what my friend is telling me too, but with the way I play games that just leads to a lot of reloading!"
378770,"Ah, thanks! I may give master mode a try later... Right now my general strategy is to drop bombs on monsters from above. It's so fun. I cleared all but the centaur in the coliseum quite handily this way."
378803,"The Expansion Pass from the Zelda bundle will include this new DLC, right?"
388236,"Having learned about the tiers, I noticed there's an extra number on the armor icons that denotes it!

Him, I will have to try that! His reaction to opening a chest from behind whole crouching is fairly funny too (can't take credit, learned it from Switch news)."
407631,"This sneak gear seemed like crap to me but everyone is recommending it, I'll go get it. Is there an easy way to switch full outfits?"
411992,Sahweet! Thanks :)
412026,"Cool, thank you! Maybe DLC 2 will have WoW like outfits ;)"
445427,"What on earth does an Amiibo actually do? Is it worth the $20? AFAICT they're cute and have NFC and touching it to the controller ""does something"" but just WTF is it that it does?"
467772,That feels like cheating.
