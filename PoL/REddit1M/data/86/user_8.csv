57094,"New to the game, looking for a relatively spoiler-free answer: 

At some point in the game does someone tell you how to get through Lost Woods? I was trying to figure out how to get through just so I could turn in my Korok seeds so I googled it, and the solution seemed kind of random and arbitrary. Then, I went through and found.... you know, the thing you find in Lost Woods, and thought to myself ""holy hell should I be here at this point in the game?""

I've conquered two of the four Divine Beasts and have maybe a third of the memories recovered. Should I set this aside for now and come back once I've ""earned"" it, or does it not matter when I complete the activities beyond the Last Woods and it won't hurt anything to do it now?

Thanks!"
