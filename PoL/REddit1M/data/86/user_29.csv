235601,"Hey all happy Thanksgiving! I really am stuck about what to do after Zora and want to move on to the Goron Devine Guardian, if that makes sense. I figured I need to get Goron Clothes, but can't seem to get to Goron City. I have a few fire elixers if I can get in temporarily then get it from someone, but that seems like a crapshoot?

I've been exploring around but can't seem to break the barrier out to the desert area or something. Trying to avoid using guides and figured this would be the best place to ask. Been gathering shrines though and nearly half full on my stamina gauge. Haha. 

Cheers in advance and any advice always welcome. This game has been a blast this past week."
