465427,"All the Amiibo figurines related to the Zelda franchise have potential of giving you gear related to the franchise, including armour sets that look like what Link was wearing in that particular game. You can get very decent weapons and mats (food, arrows, ancient parts, etc.) The way it works, you activate the Amiibo rune, then you tap an Amiibo on the right analog stick. From the sky will drop a certain amount of mats, then a chest. Could be gear inside, could be crap. It's basically Botw's version of loot box phenomenon. Each Amiibo can be scanned once a day"
