92147,I also recently started master mode and am about the same amount of time in. Head to the southern part of the Hebra region and speak to Bob Ross to do snow bowling and knock down those happy little pins. Easily the fastest/one of the fastest ways to earn rupees. Every now and then I spend about 10-15 minutes to get around 2K so I don't have to worry about not having enough for something.

However, in all situations I can think of where you require a torch, there is a torch nearby usually. Or, there are alternatives to the torch like flint/firewood or fire arrows or something for whatever you needed a torch for."

I play on the WII U and don't want to be left in the dust simply for purchasing it on a console they originally advertised it was going to be on years ago."
