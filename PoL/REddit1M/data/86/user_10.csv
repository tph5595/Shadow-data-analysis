91765,Is the Korok Leaf really that important to always keep with you? Same goes for a torch. What is everyone's recommended ratio of one and two handed weapons?
94263,Thank you for the detailed answer. I've only done one divine beast so far and I've had the leaf with me since day 1. It took me until just this morning to question why I carry it around lol.
97199,I only asked about the 1 and 2 handed ratio too because I went into the castle grounds early. A lot of those weapons are two handed. I wish there was an elixir for strength that you could weild two handers as one handers for a short duration.
