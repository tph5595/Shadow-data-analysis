One hint, for the 3rd trial. Be sure to have your sensor looking for chests. You'll come across some ancient arrows that are nearly required if you want to have any chance."

I like to keep a leaf on me just encase I come across a raft or want to mess around, but if there is a better item, just get rid of it. :)

Two handed weapons are obviously stronger and more durable, but slower, clunky, and to me less appealing. I'd much rather have one-handed. I try to keep my basic 1-handed:2-handed ratio to about 2:1. Then throw in a few elemental and the master sword. "

One tip is to use bombs as often as you can to cut down on the use of equipment. 

On I think the fourth stage is where the moblins are in the forest with the skull. Get in a tree, use Stasis and quickly glide behind them to sneak strike them. If you don't use Stasis, they will detect you. Then climb on the skull rock and you can likely use bombs to eventually kill off the bokoblins inside. 

When you're using arrows, always make sure to hit your headshots. Minimize body shots. 

For the two white Lizals on Floor 10. The safest method is to get above them, drop a few bundles of wood on them and shoot a fire arrow to ignite the wood. It will burn and kill the white Lizals and they shouldn't move. Otherwise, when the stage starts, get a headshot on the first Lizal that sees you. Then sneak behind one of the Lizals and sneakstrike them. When the fall down, walk to where they WERE looking. They'll jump up, look right at you, but ignore you and look to where they were attacked from, then you sneak strike again and repeat. This is easy, but risky because if you happen to make them collapse into the water, it's pretty much over lol.

Any other questions feel free to ask."
