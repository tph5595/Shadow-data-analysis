The only exclusive content that the Nintendo Switch version has compared to the Wii U version is that there's a special news channel feature for Nintendo Switch. Various Breath of the Wild news articles explain gameplay features and tips. There's an option at the bottom of the news article to load up your game to receive free goodies (based on the article's topic). Though, all of these free goodies can also be obtained through normal gameplay, there's nothing exclusive.

Here are possible rewards from different news articles:

- 2 Apples and 1 Raw Meat.
- 2 Courser Bee Honeys.
- 1 Boomerang in a treasure chest.
- 2 Bird Eggs. (These might break before you can pick them up!)
- 1 Emblazoned Shield in a treasure chest.
- 1 Bright-Eyed Crab and 2 Stamella Shrooms. (The crab is dead.)
- 1 Hyrule Bass, 2 Hyrule Shrooms, and 1 Raw Bird Drumstick. (The fish is dead.)
- 1 Fire Rod in a treasure chest.
- 1 Rusty Broadsword in a treasure chest.
- 1 Voltfruit, 1 Cool Safflina, and 1 Spicy Pepper.
- 1 Razorclaw Crab, 1 Mighty Porgy, 1 Mighty Bananas, 1 Rock Salt. (The crab and fish are alive?!)
- 3 Yellow Chuchu Jellies and 3 Electric Keese Wings.
- Arrow x5 in a treasure chest.
- Gerudo Scimitar in a treasure chest."

- 2 Mighty Porgy
- 1 Bladed Rhino Beetle
- 2 Bokoblin Guts

For elixirs, there's 3 aspects to consider: animal parts, monster parts, and food parts. To make an elixir, you only need 1 animal part and 1 monster part. But in order to more easily reach higher effect tiers, you should include food parts. It will still be an elixir even with the food part.

The monster part only affects the time the effect will last. The food/animal parts modifies the effect tier (along with time).

You don't need to use such rare guts like Lynel Guts and Hinox Guts; Bokoblin Guts are more common and offer an identical time boost. Guts are in the ""tier 3"" category for monster parts.
