Best game ever (maybe only Fallout 2 could be so good in my opinion)!
To be honest... I don't have any questions... I just wanted to share it with you guys!
But if I have to ask... So Zelda finished. What's next?
I was thinking about Oddysey, but I don't wanna start RPG one after another. So maybe just buy Master Trials? Did someone try this one? :)"
518623,"I think I will buy it. Not for Master Mode, cause I'll not start the game again. Just for Master Trials quests. And 2nd DLC ofc. 
If not Zelda (or after DLC), I think Resident Evil, or Mario Kart 8. 
Also I just bought Rocket League and Crimsonland, but those are not games for weeks or months as Zelda is. "
518842,"1) I have no idea why do you think this game is not worht playing...
It's just a masterpiece. 
But if that's the reason (pernament weapon...?) you think it's not worth playing... Just give up. 
2) You have Master Sword, which is unbrekable. And also very powerful. "
