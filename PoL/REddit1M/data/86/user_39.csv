399086,My understanding is that the wolf is part of the scenario? It comes to attack the korok and you have to kill it without the korok noticing.

Funny because I got one in the first few minutes and it was the same one I had for the whole game. I still have it in my inventory now. It only gets damaged when you hit an enemy with it which is something you'd never use it for anyway."
