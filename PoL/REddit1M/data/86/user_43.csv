479076,Is there ever going to be a permanent weapon that would make this game worth playing?
540889,"1. I have given up. It's BS that they are forcing this game mechanic down our throats when there could easily be an option for it. Fallout had the V.A.T.S. system which I didn't really like to use, but they didn't force you to use it. It's tedious to have to go through a menu and switch out my weapon during a fight and takes me out of the game.
2. The Master sword needs to rest for 10 minutes and there is little to no control over it since you can't recharge it until it's fully expended so that puts us at the mercy of the game mechanic as opposed to putting us in control of the game mechanic. 3. If you're going to number all your points then you should have more than two. 4. Shush."
