105210,I'm on my Master Mode run and just finished the 4th beast.  Does anyone recommend a Shrine map/guide that is particularly useful?  I did all 120 on my Normal file and would rather just blast through them again so I can do the Trial of the Sword asap.
105347,"For the first part, the game hints at the Lost Woods puzzle solution when you first enter.  You see the stationary torches ""pointing"" you in the direction of other stationary torches if you look closely enough.  Then when you're left to carry your own torch, you should already know the solution.

Overall, it doesn't matter when you complete activities in the game; you can realistically do anything in any order you want."
109745,"I've heard Trial on Master Mode is especially aggravating though, so I was going to wait until I had more heart containers.

I guess you're right though, I could always just eat for gold hearts.

Thank you for the link to the map!"
