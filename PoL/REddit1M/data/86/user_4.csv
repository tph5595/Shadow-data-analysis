38270,"I️ have a question about using the champion amiibos. I️ am fairly early on in my playthrough and the items I️ get from scanning the champion amiibos are not the strong weapons or the divine helmets. I️ just get weaker weapons and diamonds on occasion. Are the strong weapons and the divine helmets progress locked? I’m assuming I️ will need to beat the corresponding divine beast to get the goods from the amiibos.

My game and system is fully updated. Thx!"
