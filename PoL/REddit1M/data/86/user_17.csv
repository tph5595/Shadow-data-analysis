294403,Have you had a wolf attack you mid-sneak?  Hardest korok trial by far.

I get like 120-210 rupees a meal.  It's a good side-gig.  A full inventory of these meals, like 200 meats (40 meals), its enough to buy the house and more. 4800!

This works well because the game gives you a bonus with multiples of the same ingredient.  So selling 5 of the prime meats nets 470, but you could have sold those to the meant enthusiast stable for 500 rupees. "

405093,Make sure to visit the Kakariko clothing shop and buy the sneak gear.  With sneak x3 you can get butterflies and beetles and fairies and sneak up on baddies super easy!
