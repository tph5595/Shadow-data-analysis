The 2's I save for bashing guardians and guy's I've frozen, also for mining ore and crashing boxes. Two handers are too slow to use in combat IMHO. Was never a fan of using the leaf to blow the darn boat around - takes far too long. . . "

The house in the village is a very secondary side venture and is entirely optional and IMHO not really worth the rupees. It's a venture you might save for later on when you want something different to do.

As far as arrows, buy as many as you need, but you don't need to spend to stock up past 70 or so. The game will always make arrows available to you and are worth buying. The armor sold in the first two villages are well worth the rupees especially the stealth. 

I got the DLC after I finished the game. It comes in handy for those who can't let go of the game once it's over and done. It's not really all that useful for you at this point in the game except for one certain mask and the feature that maps where you've traveled. 

General advice at your stage would be to try to light up all the SE towers, explore those areas and then explore north of Kakariko to Lanaryu where you might tackle your first beast. Good luck!"
