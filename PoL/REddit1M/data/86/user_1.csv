10086,"I've got two questions here.

-I'm currently 200 hours in, and have beat all of the shrines along with the story a while back. I'm using the mask to help me find more of the Koroks but I'm still only in the 300's and having some trouble really getting a good strategy on how to even hunt well. It just feels like I'm wondering around forever and finding none a lot of the time. Hard to decide on where to even begin sometimes. Also, looking for more to pass the time and have an excuse to keep playing. 

-Any good tips on the Trials? I've beat the first but haven't had the time to jump into the second since I usually don't have an hour or two to sit down and focus on something that difficult with family and such. Plus the thought of going in, spending 2 hours in there and dying to have to start all over again doesn't sound fun to me. "
