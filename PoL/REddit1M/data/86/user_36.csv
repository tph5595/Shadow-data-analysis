I didn't realize the wind gust would knock them apart until recently. I imagine it could help save a little on the durability of your other weapons."

The food items that can be used to increase attack are:
Mighty Bananas
Razorshrooms
Mighty Thistle
Mighty Carp
Mighty Porgy
Razorclaw Crab
and for making elixirs, not food, Bladed Rhino Beetle.

Just checking, now that you're done with the Kakariko and Hateno areas, you did get some of the better armors -- the Champion's Tunic, the Soldier's Armor -- and upgrade them before leaving? If not, that might help if enemies around the Lanayru Tower are giving you too much trouble."

I'd usually take so long trying to get my targeting lined up into the blue of the eye that I'd end up getting blasted before I could get it all set. When I accidentally hit off of center at the eye once and still hit a crit, I realized I didn't have to be as exact as I thought I did.

I'm like you, I can't stand motion controls, though the apparatuses in shrines don't bother me anywhere near as much as trying to target the bow. I've never tried mounted archery based combat before. "

365501,There are several armors that need some of the various types of Chuchu Jelly for upgrades.

Additionally, whenever you encounter an enemy camp, if you can kill the archer lookouts that stand up on a platform before they fire their arrows, they'll usually drop a bundle of 5 arrows when they die. Especially in the early game, I'll sometimes warp back to the Great Plateau after a Blood Moon to take out the Bokoblin archers near the tower and in the nearby woods just to get their arrows.

I like buying the house, but I don't make it a priority, especially when that money can be used to buy armor instead. I usually make money by selling monster parts and the more common gems (Amber, Opal) because it's easy to get more, but still, some quantity of them are needed for armor upgrades.

Personally, I say get all the armor so you have options. The Champion's Tunic is in the highest defense tier (Tier-5) and is the best armor, by defense rating, in the game. But that tunic doesn't cover your head or legs. The next tier down (Tier-4) has three armor sets in it, one of which you can buy in Hateno relatively cheaply. The Stealth Armor from Kakariko, though it has a low defense rating (Tier-2), is beneficial if you're trying to sneak around. There are other armor sets that become necessary in different locations as you progress through the game; you usually find them at various towns near the locations wherein you need them."

And speaking of people thinking Link is studly, occasionally, characters will react in different ways to Link if he's not wearing a shirt at all. It can be fun to see the variant reactions sometimes."
393322,The number on the armor icon indicates the current defense rating of that piece of armor; it'll will change as you upgrade a respective piece of armor. Each tier upgrades in a different set progression.
