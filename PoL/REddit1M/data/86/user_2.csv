10447,"The beginning trials are the hardest but I would go in with 30 hearts and a 30 min attack 3 effect. If you don't have the hearts than make a hearty dish to fill it up. Attack 3 for 30 minutes is 3 mighty bananas, 1 mighty thistle, and 1 dragon horn.

Headshot using arrow time helps a lot. There are 9 ancient arrows in the final trials spread across 3 chests. Use Sheikah sensor on a chest to help find them."

Or you could make a level 3 stealth potion."
93002,"Korok Leaf isn't that important, definitely not worth carrying one with you. I always carried a torch and sledgehammer but you could get away without carrying one.

Most of my weapon slots are currently filled with 2 handed weapons, usually 1 spear, and a couple 1 handed weapons. But that is because I have the fully upgraded Master Sword and I am hunting Guardians &amp; Lynels. Before getting the master sword I kept 1 to 2 spears, a couple 2 handed weapons, and the rest one handed weapons. Spears are great against Stals, Bats, and Lizalfos, 2 Handed are good against Moblins, Guardians, and Mini-bosses, and 1 handed is everything else."
95405,It was the same for me on my first play through. Playing through again on Master Mode has shown me how much I didn't know or care about on Normal.

Edit: You can do Trial of the Sword without doing all shrines. I had 14 hearts and almost 2 wheels of stamina. Just go in with golden hearts  and attack 3 effect"
110743,"Oh it is a little aggravating but more hearts won't help. The extra stamina is useful on middle and final for longer arrow time.

Good luck"
206745,All of the effects are addictive but max at 3. Level 3 stealth is really effective. You can walk without anyone hearing
