I'm not good with motion controls (I had to do the whole flip the maze thing upsidown for that one shrine temple because I failed to guide the ball 58 times (Yes, I counted.)) I'm also not good at timing (So I will never do the shield trick.)

Can someone also tell me tips for mounted combat? Because Again, because I'm not good at timing, I'm terrible at mounted combat in video games, especially *third person* mounted combat."
