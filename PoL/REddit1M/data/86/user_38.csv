366275,Something I did not realize until very late! Fighting Lynels with Phantom or Barbarian armor and quaffing attack potions not realizing it was doing bupkis. The UI makes this really clear. The UI is actually really good but not well explained ever. 
366334,If you hold a two handed weapon the wolf is less likely to attack — at least that is my theory why it didn’t attack me when I got through that part. 
367221,"I would suggest to anyone freshly playing to visit Hyrule Castle early on (perhaps after completing their first beast) in order to collect treasure there. Remember, you can track treasure chests using your Sheikah Slate. Lots of valuable items can be had in Hyrule Castle early on in the game, even if you do not want (or are ready) to face Ganon. [The Hylian Shield, for example, is there behind a mini boss](/spoiler).

I would recommend making a lot of base (no-perk) food if you plan on doing the Ganon fight. Farm 4-6 faeries would also be a good thing. Also, having all of your champion abilities powered up and ready to go for the Ganon fight certainly helps. 

Most of the mobs are Guardians, so ancient arrows trivialize them. There are also Lynel's in Hyrule castle so be prepared. If you have never been locked into a fight with one of those before, it can be learning experience (for me it was, anyway). 

Its easy enough to get lost in the Castle exploring for several hours. It is worth taking the time to appreciate all of it, because in a lot of ways it is the center piece of this beautiful piece of art. If you want to b-line it to Ganon, just look at the map, be sneaky, and I think you can get there in about 10 minutes after entering the area depending on which entrance you take and how strong or sneaky you are when it comes to all the guardians.

If you have the DLC and have found the translocator item it is pretty useful for Hyrule Castle. I like to farm the two lynels that are next to each other after the blood moon and usually keep my teleportation spot there."
368670,"How do I make a +3 attack elixir? I've tried bladed rhino horn beetles in just about every combination of guts but can't get more than a +2 attack elixir. 

I know I can make a +3 attack meal using mighty bananas -- just trying to figure out if there is anyway with elixirs. I have quite a bit of monster parts (like lynel and hinox for example) and wondering if they are worth anything since I can't seem to produce any elixirs worth drinking. Thanks!"
369665,"Ok - for arrows, I just take the main route to Zora's domain. Almost all of the Lizalfos mobs in that route will have at least 1 bundle of 5 arrows on them (so try not to launch them into the water on that killing blow). I usually collect about 110 arrows on a single walk through.

The house is useful not just because it is actually a cheap +3 storage for shields, bows, and weapons, but it also starts a really cool quest line. [The building of Terry Town which is needed to replace the Hylian Shield if ever you lose it](/spoiler). 

&gt; But should I just sell my gems and extra monster parts and cooked food to get the house?

Yes, basically. Like, I have a 155 Lizalfos Horns; I'll sell 75 of those. I have only 6 Ice Keese Wings, I won't sell any of those. If you have played long enough you have figured out that the Great Fairy will upgrade armor for the cost of items (and coin, up front for each one of her sisters that you find). You can look up online which items are needed to upgrade which gear pieces you plan to use or take my initial approach of trying to hold onto a little of everything. So many times a particular (and seemingly random) item will also be needed for a quest line, so a good general strategy is sell the items you have a lot of but not completely.

&gt; Also, what armor set should I be trying to get? I have the climber's bandana and my champion tunic. Final thing; I have the DLC, but how do I use it? It said there would be more chests on the Great Plateau, but I never found them. Is it just the Outpost Ruins quests now?

I think most players who really get into this game will likely end up buying all of the armor sets eventually. Since you mention you have the DLC, I recommend obtaining the Phantom Armor (which you can get right after you get off the Great Plateau). The quest leads you to a book which tells you the general location of each item in Hyrule Fields in front of Hyrule Castle. There are guardians there, but for the most part you can sneak around them. Use Magnesis to spot the chests and if you get stuck look it up online. The upgrade to the Phantom Armor is the Barbarian Armor which you obtain by completing the maze shrine quests (look for spots on your map that look like mazes). The Travel Medallion, Korok Mask, and Majora's Mask are all awesome items to have from the DLC, so seek them out. 

&gt; I'd love just like a basic here's how to get through your first divine beast minimal spoiler guide.

Just give it your best first attempt and use google or ask here when you get stuck. Most puzzles involve some map interaction (so check your map for the beast controls). Also, some puzzles can involve actions that happen across the beast from map controls (such as making or breaking a power connection).

Edit: Also, since you mention you had the DLC -- if you want more of a challenge, play on master mode. It isn't THAT much harder, and can be more rewarding. For example, since the mobs are all ranked up, they drop more things that are valuable like gems."
