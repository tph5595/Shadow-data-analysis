53764,I find it fun having to manage my inventory. I like that there's forced variance in weapon styles as opposed to just using what's best the entire time. I like that it forces you to go out into the world to constantly play the game to keep up with gear. If out didn't break I'd just skip all the battles and rush to whatever I was doing because there would be no need to kill things.
55663,When you kill mobs they respawn with higher health and weapons later so by killing them it increases the amount better weapons available overall btw
