You don't just default to your best gear and keep it forever. In a game like Breath of the Wild where you can go to the very high level areas, if you manage to kill one of those guys you shouldn't be able to have great weapons that'll make the rest of the game a joke. 

If there was no weapon durability, throwing your weapons would be really broken and would have no punishments. Of course we could remove throwing, but it's a fun mechanic and both spears and boomerangs rely on this mechanic to have full usability."

Plus, that isn't enough to trump all the negatives listed above."
