12128,"The people complaining are probably at the start of the game, I also found it very annoying at the start as trying to kill a challenging enemy would basically destroy 70% of my arsenal, At times i even ran out of weapons and had to flee even though i could dodge all the attacks

Fast forward a few hours with some inventory expansions i'm basically swimming in weapons and constantly have to drop them in order to have room for the better ones

Having one weapon at all times that doesn't break would take away so much from this game, I absolutely love the food, weapon, buff system"
