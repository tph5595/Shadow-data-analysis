50054,"Only time I felt upset about the weapon durability so far was in that strong test of strength on that little island on the east, just west of the evendusk island.  Just got my first cutscene in terms of the plot, but I felt like I could have beaten that mini boss in that challenge if I had more durable weapons. .... Actually I went through all my weapons (like... 5 swords and a guardian axe+) and was left with a wood Axe and a leaf and the boss was doing that final laser beam loop."
