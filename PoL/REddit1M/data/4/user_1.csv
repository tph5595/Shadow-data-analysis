411,"One question, can you get the Hylian Shield and Master Sword back if they break? I've seen a lot of conflicting info on this, I'm hoping that you can somehow fix it perhaps? One of my fav Youtuber's who has been streaming the game (Vinny from Vinesauce) got the Hylian Shield early and one of the commenters said that the Hylian Shield breaks after a certain amount of Guardian laser deflects. My hope was that you keep the remnants of the two items and you can repair it in some form or fashion, and it's vital not to throw away said remnants so you can indeed use it again. Sorry for all the questions haha, I would like to pass along the info to him next time he streams "
957,"Ah interesting. Thank you for the reply, I'll be sure to let him know when he comes across it. I will also let him know you and the Zelda Reddit sub gave me the info. Thanks again "
