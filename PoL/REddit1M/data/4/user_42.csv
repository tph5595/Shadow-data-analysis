The entire game is about forging your own way in this wild broken world. Your weapons breaking and leaving you helpless, forcing you to grab whatever you can to survive, evokes a feeling of general helplessness that the entire early game expresses. I mean hell, the entire story is centered around [Hyrule spending years preparing for the fight against Ganon only for all of their efforts to be immediately undone and turned against them.](/spoiler)."

What /u/TheMuffinMan0311 described is so incredibly easy to do:

1. Eat food

2. Shoot Guardian with arrow

In the context of these comments, the rest of his post did not matter to the argument that I was having with /u/Trocian. Trocian was saying that he ""didn't comprehend"" the post, and I refuted that by stating that he clearly did comprehend because he responded clearly in the first sentence.

When viewed in the context of this argument, the rest of the post doesn't matter."

No problem bro, yeah he could've been a bit more respectful. I'm a Dark Souls boy so git gud doesn't register to me much anymore."
