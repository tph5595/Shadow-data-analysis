20307,The Diamond are pretty easy to get. A Npc in Zora's domain will exchange you 10 Nox (is that what they are called in english ?) for a diamond.
20396,"I you complete the Quest ""From the ground up"", there is an NPC that sell Unique Item you already found."
23409,For that I Marked where I could find the rock monsters. They are easy to kill and the reward if always worth the time.
26157,"There are two near the Gron village (one on the path there just before the mines, nd the other behind the crab (tht you need to kill for a quest).

There are a few other but I don't really remenber where (I marked them for later, but I don't have the game with me right now)

Those near the goron are really useful, since, I don't know if it's a bug, but when I'm north I get a blood moon every night, hell one time I did the same one 4 time back to back since I got the blood moon three times in a night.
