33554,I had like 10 really great weapons 20-40 damage range. Then I fought one blue Lynel and now I'm down to 5. Still totally worth it though.
49851,Had to use defense up to not die in two hits :( I guess it depends on if you want to preserve weapons or food. Next time I go kill him I'll probably have upgraded armour a bit more and more hearts so I can focus on attack up.
51455,The blue ones were a bit tough. Red ones aren't that bad though. I think I'll stick to red ones for a while. Need Lynel monster parts for armor upgrades.
52111,I think the one on top of the mountain near Zoras Domain is red.
52601,"Oh yeah, I realized after killing him that you could probably reach the needed number of arrows by just picking them off all the trees. That quest was really well designed.

Someone else mentioned in another comment that the one on top of that mountain was grey/silver but I'm not sure. The mane is red and the body grey/silver. But I found that fight a lot easier than the one with the blue lynel."
