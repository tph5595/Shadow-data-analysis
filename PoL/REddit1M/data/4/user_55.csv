51664,"My frustraistion isn't with the fact that weapons are difficult to get, becasue like you said they aren't, my problem is just that its not a fun system, it breaks immersion because iron swords don't crumble into dust, it takes excitement out of getting cool weapons, because you know they'll break soon enough, and it encourages you to use mid level stuff to save your best stuff for a later that may never come. 

It is by far the worst thing about the game and its so unnessisary make all weapons unbreakable(with some balance changes) and it doesn't really change the game. Or even just make them degrade so they do next to no damage and have to be repared, that way you at least get to keep cool weapons that are hard to find."
51786,Please tell me one thing that it adds to the game?
52429,"If they stick by the system then I think the number of complaints at least says that they haven't balanced it very well, so I think increasing the duribility of most or all weapons would go a long way.

Also not showing the duribility of weapons is just stupid, if they show the relative attack strength then they should show duribility. It doen't even need to gradually go down, just knowing that this has a duribility of 10 compared to 5 would go a long way."
54482,"What do you mean by inventory management, do you mean just changing weapons in the middle of battle? Cos you can't exactly reorder them. You can still change weapons mid battle even if weapons don't break, it would still be good stratagy to get quick hits in and then switch to a big weapon, or to knock them down and then go to town up close.

Variance in weapons is better done by having certain enimies be weak strong to particular types or situations, like spears being better on horses.

Exploring is only interesting IMO if you are finding new things, which you would still have if weapons didn't break, going out to find a travellers sword isn't exactly thrilling.

And as for skipping battles I'm finding the exact opposite, i'm avoiding fighing regular guys because it's not worth damaging my knights sword to get a club in return. If weapons didn't break i'd be going to town on all the camps but as it is I just ride past every time."

I'll give you that it makes weak weapons useful.

I still think you would get the same benefits if weapons got damaged but didn't break and could be repaired though."
55808,"I did not know that, that does change my opinion somewhat, regular enemies still do mostly have clubs and stuff though, whereas if I'm playing a Zelda game I want to be using a sword."
