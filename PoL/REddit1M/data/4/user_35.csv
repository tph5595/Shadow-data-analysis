41754,"I think that my frustration with weapon durability peaked around the time I reached Hateno Village, as most of my decent weapons had broken against some of the more durable enemies like Moblins and Lizalfos, and I was forced to use weak weapons the enemies wielded. However, it seemed like I started receiving strong weapons at a much more tolerable rate as the game progressed a little further. Overall, I think it actually works in the games favor, as it encouraged me to try varied weapons and fighting styles I wouldn't have otherwise considered. I think the diversity of combat is essential to making the game engaging, even after hours of play."
