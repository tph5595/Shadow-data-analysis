55707,"I quickly did my best to adjust my brain to view weapons like a person would view ammunition in a shooter.  Most enemies drop it, and more can always be acquired.  Sure, some of them have better modifiers, or a specific focus (i.e. the Frost Sword or whatever that sweet piece of equipment is) but that's why you buy a house and mount that bitch for later when you will specifically need frost damage.

I really enjoy being forced to use a bunch of different weapons instead of just swinging a standard sword all day long.  And for those that really just want to use the same weapon, there is the Master Sword.  Yes, it'll break, but it's very durable and it'll be back in a few minutes."
