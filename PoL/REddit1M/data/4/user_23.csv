21691,"I mean... you get weapons that break in like 20 hits instead of 10. Yay.

Even the freaking master sword runs out of energy and goes into a tedious 10 minute cooldown. What's even more annoying is that it doesn't recharge per hit. If you have 1 charge left you might as well hit something to start the cooldown timer.

I get where you're coming from and maybe its a bit overblown, but even still its annoying as all hell. I found a major test of strength early on and I chewed through 6 (yes, SIX) brand new weapons. The stupid thing was at 75% still. I tried throwing bombs, everything. All of its moves were telegraphed so I wasn't taking damage but I got so bored of breaking weapons against a 9 million hp shrine boss that I just left and said screw it.

When I fought the last boss the master sword didn't seem to have durability though. I wish it had just been like that the entire game. I wanted some escape from the weapon recycling hell."
