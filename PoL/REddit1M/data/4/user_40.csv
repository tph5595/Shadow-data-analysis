45990,"I still feel that the weapons degrade too quickly, and it limits your freedom to play how you would like. I personally love the super low tier weapons like the traveler's, and broadswords, and would like to be able to keep and maintain one of them throughout my play through. Degradation to the point of being unusable but with a repair mechanic is all I ask for. 


It would still encourage the on the fly drop and swap technique, but if you *really* liked a specific weapon regardless of stats it would give you options other than searching the world over and filling your whole inventory with duplicates of that one weapon. "
