5449,Let's not try to sweep a bunch of valid complaints under the rug just because we like the game.  I don't find it to be a very fun mechanic even though I love every other aspect of the game.  Especially considering Nintendo's history with patching games.

It's the most common thing complained about and it's one of the few things most critics had an issue with too.  
   
But I suppose there's always a chance that every single person complaining is just an idiot and all the critics who complained are also wrong and that the game is the first game ever that doesn't have a single flaw.  
   
Again, I think that if the early game weapons didn't break as quickly, the game would be a better game.  And I hope they patch it after seeing most complain, which they probably will do because Nintendo is very good at patching things that people don't like.  
  
I didn't realize that saying I don't like one small single early game aspect of this game would illicit such a ridiculous amount of downvotes, but whatever.  "
