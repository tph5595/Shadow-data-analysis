You didn't comprehend his post, and instead decided to brag about how easily you can kill this monster, and people upvote you for it. Wow."

48722,"You're way overestimating the strategy required for these fights. All damage is easily avoidable, and the only thing that matters is your damage. Either you kill it before you run out, or you don't.

All the freedom we got with BotW mean little when you're so very limited by your weapons. Having an unbreakable weapon with very low damage would make it so much better. "
48958,"All I read about is how BotW is so open and free and you can do anything in whatever order you want. Turns out you can't, and perfect play doesn't cancel out the horrible weapon system, that's why I'm ignoring it."

By having weapons that do Y damage instead of X damage. This is not ""being better at the game""."

Of course it isn't, but it can't be done with a 1 damage weapon. You need a 1+X damage weapon, which is the whole point. You need gear, not skill. The durability system discourages skill, and puts a larger emphasis on your equipment.

You mean farm better gear."

Going in with equal gear, I agree. But with the game being what it is, you probably aren't.

The game is good, the durability system isn't. But this is /r/zelda, and any posts not praising everything and anything is downvoted."
