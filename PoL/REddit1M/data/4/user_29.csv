32663,"If you went through 6 weapons on a Major Test of Strength, you were probably doing it too early and with shit weapons. 

I can beat a Major Test of Strength with a blizzard/lightning rod, and a single greatsword. Eat an Attack Up food at the start, Freeze or shock the Guardian, switch to a 40-50 damage  Greatsword, hold Y to to do the spinning wind-up charge attack and keeping holding it as you circle the guardian. With 2 stamina circles you can do 500-1000 damage before you run out of stamina. Then just switch back to your blizz/lightning rod and freeze/shock it again. You can beat a Major Test of Strength in 45 seconds

In other words, get good. You're having a frustrating experience because you're playing the game stupid/badly "
46946,"I comprehended just fine. His issue was that he busted through 6 weapons on a high health enemy. My point is that he busted through the weapons because 1. they were most likely low damage weapons, which means he was doing the shrine too early or ill prepared, and 2. his lack of strategy in approaching the TRIAL of combat shows that he failed at the TRIAL aspect of the shrine. aka, he was playing the game in a stupid manner and attempting to brute-force a challenge that wasn't meant to be brute-forced, and instead was meant to be approached strategically. Durability isn't the issue in this scenario, it's his own ignorance of the task at hand. You can beat the challenge without breaking a single weapon, he did the challenge *incorrectly* and was punished for it. That isn't the fault of the game's durability system. "
49243,"No, I'm not overestimating it. The challenges are not just ""deal damage"", it's HOW you deal damage and with what. If you enter the fight with ten 16 damage daggers, of fucking course you're going to break through all of them on a 2k health enemy, because you're not meant to take it on that way. If you bust through 10 weapons in that fight, it's not the game's durability system that is at fault, it's YOUR fault for literally just throwing weapons at a brick wall. You can beat the shrine while break 0 weapons by *being good at the game*, or you can blow through 10 weapons by being bad at the game and then complain on the internet that the game's durability system is at fault. "
50268,"Might potions, charge attacks, different weapon types. Plus, what equipment you use to approach a challenge is part of the strategy, it's called being *prepared*. It was literally the first thing I said in my post: if you broke so many weapons, it's because *you were using the wrong weapons*. That's not the fucking weapon durability system's fault, it's your approach to the challenge that was wrong. And yes, that is part of being good at the game, because if you see a 3k health enemy and you're attacking it with a 16 damage dagger, it's because you're fucking stupid and you shouldn't be rewarded for trying to ignorantly bash your head against a door until it gives in, never thinking that maybe you should turn the door knob. 

Do you really think this person's problem would have been solved if there was an unbreakable 16 damage sword in the game? so, what, they can just bash away at a 3k health enemy for 15 minutes, and then complain that the shrine is too boring? The fact of the matter is that there *is* an infinite durability weapon in the game. It's called the bomb rune. Why don't you try bashing bombs against every boss in the game infinitely and see if that's fun. 

You're demonstrably wrong in this conversation, please stop embarrassing yourself. If Person A tries a challenge and breaks all their weapons while only dealing 25% of an enemies health, so they blame the game's mechanics, while Person B approaches the same challenge and breaks 0 weapons, then it's clear that it's not the game mechanics fault"
52124,"There are legitimate criticisms of the durability system to be heard. This conversation is exclusively about how the statement ""I broke 6 Swords on a Major Test Shrine, the durability system sucks!"" is *not* one of those valid criticisms. You break 6 Swords on a Combat challenge by being stupid, not by being being the victim of unfair game mechanics. "
64702,"What, does the Dark Souls sub have a problem with people coming into their sub and saying they tried to fight Ornstein and Smoug with a Bandit Dagger and got their ass kicked so clearly it's the game's fault and it's broken? Go figure people react negatively "
