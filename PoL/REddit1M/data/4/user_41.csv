46303,"I would be happier with even a simple system to track the durability of each weapon, beyond generic verbiage in the description. Even if they made it an upgrade to the slate or something you have to earn. I also wish it was a bit easier to add inventory slots (although I just did this for the first time so maybe it is easy once you start doing it). 

I guess the current mechanics are more ""realistic"" but it makes it harder to strategize. Plus if we're gonna go ""real"" then where the hell does Link keep five spears, four shields, five bows, etc? "
