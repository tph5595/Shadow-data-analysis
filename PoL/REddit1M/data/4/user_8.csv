8315,What needs to be patched exactly? This game is working exactly how the designers thought it would..?
39315,"Yeah I mean I didn't downvote you, but saying that 90% of the players don't like durability is way overboard. I'll give it to you, a lot of complaints are on the durability system, but they are the loud minority. I would venture to guess the amount of people enjoying the game by far outweigh the people coming to these boards crying, ""OMGZZZ WHEN DO YOU GET THE MASTER SWORDDDD!! WHAAAAT?! IT ISN'T INFINITE TOO!! STUPID NINTENDO!! THIS NEEDS TO BE PATCHED!!""

People need to understand and take this game for what it is, sure it has some flaws, but overall it took a gigantic leap of faith in going in a new direction for Zelda games. If you gave this game different characters, and stuck this side by side to any LoZ game ever, you wouldn't know this game was Zelda. Kudos to Nintendo for breaking the mold. "

A low tier sword, which in the description, says it's a sword not meant to be used for long term battles, it's meant as protection and last resort use for a ""traveler"" hence the name ""travelers sword.""

If you look at any of the major reviews, IGN, Gamespot, Polygon, none of their cons is the durability system. I never said everyone who complained about it is an idiot. Not by any means. What I said was that Nintendo took a leap of faith and took Zelda into a realm that it's never been. For a game launching with a new system if this game flopped it would mean potential losses in the millions of dollars. 

Also, if you're not equipped, and are finding yourself constantly looking for weapons or running into problems in the middle of the fight *that meant you aren't supposed to be in that fight!* The enemies get harder the more you kill of that type. So if you want to run in and kill every enemy, you're only setting yourself up for a harder time later down the road. 

Again, the people complaining are the vocal minority. Simple as that. You don't like the weapon durability system early on? That's fine, but to state that it's broken and needs a patch when it's working exactly as intended is asinine, and that's why you're being downvoted to hell. "
67761,Offering criticism is different than 90% of the posts on this sub. 
69139,I don't think saying 90% of the posts about weapon durability on this sub crying more than criticism is overboard. I would be willing to bet that a lot of people would agree. 
70781,"I'm not arguing with you. There are people with rose tinted glasses on, who think the game can do no wrong. But that wasn't what this thread continued on. I didn't say that everything people are saying are without warrant. There is a fine line between crying and criticism, and you seem like a smart guy, so I'm sure you know the difference. "
