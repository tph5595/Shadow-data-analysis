49286,"I enjoy the durability mechanic but my complaint with it is actually for slightly different reasons... *the weapons you get are really, really cool*. I'm afraid of using this Thunderblade I picked up because the art is awesome. Same with this Great Frostblade. Also these guardian weapons... I wish I could repair them and keep them in reserve. I just wish there was a method to spend rupees so I could use my favorite weapons I find in my journey. Honestly in the scheme of the game, minor complaint because everything else is amazing.

Anyway, I've read about the super durable weapons you can get later... could someone PM me what the requirements are to repair them/get them back? I don't have them yet but I know what they are, I just really want a kickass bow and a kickass spear to use. "
