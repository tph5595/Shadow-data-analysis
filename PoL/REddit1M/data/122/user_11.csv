2099,"So this is bizarre: On a ledge south of the Akalla Great Fairy, there are 3 apple trees where you have to match the fruit. However, every time I've gone, the easternmost tree doesn't have an apple on it at all. I've tried picking all the fruit and blowing up the trees, but every time I go, there are still no apples. Anyone else having this problem?"

14958,No I just plucked them all a few days ago.
15096,What do you mean?
