11588,"How do I advance the ""A Gift for my Beloved"" quest?  I tried talking with her, all I can do is get a bed or a comfy bed, there's no dialogue options.  I tried getting a regular bed, just to see if that would open up some dialogue trees, but no luck."
11877,"One additional question.  I found a second fairy fountain (near the town being built on an island).  There's a tree surrounded by four clusters of flowers (each one with a different number of flowers).  I hit them in the correct order to make them switch colors, but is there a bundle of five somewhere that I've missed?  I tried climbing the tree in the center, but nothing up there, either."
