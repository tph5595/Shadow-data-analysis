When you're low on hearts you have to change your gameplay style though. I was exclusively sneaky until just recently when I realised I'm now strong enough to mow down any minor enemies. 

I fought my first Stone Talus in ages last night, and was amazed at how easy it had become!"

I'm not sure how that would turn out though!"
