8468,"If I recall correctly (I might be confusing this with another shrine) but when you light the stuff in the locked room on fire, either with an arrow or a torch, I believe a barrel or box burns up and releases a small key. You can then use magnesis to lift the small key over the wall and grab it. Then use the key to unlock the door."
