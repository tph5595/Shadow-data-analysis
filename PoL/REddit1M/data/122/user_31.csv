The Soldier's set is the easiest way to get high defense. The Champion's Tunic has higher defense than the Soldier's Armor, but it's harder to upgrade (though not too hard, and it's fun to figure out how to farm the parts necessary).

The Ancient set has the same defense as the Soldier's set with a set bonus to boot, but it's really expensive to buy and upgrade (and is also way uglier, if you care about that sort of thing).

The Amber Earrings have the same defense as the Soldier's Helm, and I don't think the Soldier set has a set bonus, so the earrings and the Soldier's Helm are fully interchangeable.

Can't tell from your comment whether this assumption might be causing you annoyance, but you do NOT have to change out of the Soldier equipment during thunderstorms; only weapons and shields attract lightning.

My favorite outfit for walking around in temperate combat territory is Amber Earrings, Champion's Tunic, and Soldier Greaves."
