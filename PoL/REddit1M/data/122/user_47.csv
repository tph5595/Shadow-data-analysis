20753,You can do anything in the game with base stamina and 3 hearts.  What are you having trouble with?
25825,There are also hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of chests.  If you track chests with Sensor+ you will completely derail your game with a neverending quest to open the next box.
31232,There's no limit (that I've seen anyone reach) to the amount of armor you can carry.
