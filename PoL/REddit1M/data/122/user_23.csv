Also, the divine beasts tend to have a couple scout guardians, so you'll grab a few weapons off of them, too."

Honestly, once you can backflip flurry rush their swiping attack, Lynels (at least the ones with swords) are pretty easy and repetitive."

Throw 3-4 attackboosting foods in with food products and 2-4 beetles/bugs in with monster parts. You'll get attack-boost meals and attack-boost elixirs that way."
