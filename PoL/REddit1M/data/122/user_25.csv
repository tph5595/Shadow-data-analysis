7294,"So there was an extra chest in a shrine i couldnt figure out how to get to.  

The Shrine was the one that you find by comparing a portrait on the wall of a stable to the landscape of death mountain and the location of the stable.  The chest I couldnt figure out was behind a locked door.  There were several wooden boxes and barrels in the rooms and I figured it had something to do with starting a fire and lifting yourself over the gate, but no matter how i played around with fire, I couldnt get high enough to get over.  spoilers are fine.

7547,"Killing guardians isnt really that hard with this trick.
Position yourself so you have a tree or rock inbetween you and the guardian.  use a movement speed potion if you want but its not necessary. let the guardian target you, then get behind the tree until the guardian approaches you. When its about as close as it gets to you, run at it, and chop off a leg.  move to the next leg, kill that, go around it in a circle removing legs.  once the legs are gone, just get up in its grill and keep attacking, it wont be able to target you if you are pressed up into its body and it cant move away from you.  takes two hits per leg with the master sword.  dont leave any legs up before you go for the body, or it will drag itself away from you and be able to target you.
