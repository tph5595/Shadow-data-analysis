9095,I would Argue that Daruk's Protection (The goron one - NE) is down right overpowered. I didn't find myself using the Van Medoh power all that much. 
9225,"I've never seen one from a Lynel. I have actually found a few from dogs that led me to treasure chests. Otherwise, when you see one fall from the sky, start running lol. "
21603,"I've heard talk about some kind of Miniboss sidequest involving Kilton? Apparently he'll tally how many of each miniboss you've killed in the overworld?

Currently when I encounter Kilton I can only ""exchange mon"", ""spend mon"" and ""goodbye"" (?)"
