15563,Do you have master sword or guardian/ancient weapons? Those help a bunch. And use stasis+. 
15917,"i think its on the other side of the tree, I cut the tree down and that one was easier. That's the one near Tarrey town, right?"
15976,"Wait, on that same one, I got her answer but the guy who starts the whole thing isn't back by the stables anymore. Does he frequent somewhere else?"
15992,Hmm good question. 
16030,"The giant door on the shield surfing course? Yeah, no idea. I assume a shrine is behind it or something?"
16092,Guardian weapons you can get from the test of strength shrines. Ancient weapons you can get from the Akkala lab in the northeastern most corner of your map. Master sword is a bit more intensive.

17813,Oh my god. There's a tracker for quests? That changes everything. I thought the only things you could have on like that were for the main quest/divine beasts!

18232,Looking at what exactly?
