65766,"Twilight Princess was too easy. Hero mode actually makes it somewhat of a challenge. it makes the purchase worth it for me. You can still regen at healing pools, and there are still fairies before the bosses."
65843,"That explains a lot... I heard it was going to use the GC version, so was expecting that, and was confused when everything seemed to be like the Wii version. Thought I was getting the two mixed up."
65988,"Loving it so far. I feel they could have probably worked on the looks a bit longer, but it still looks pretty great. Hero mode was a great addition, and I love the little things that they fixed which bothered me in the original, like Links ridiculously slow climbing speed. And once again, the gamepad proves just how ridiculously useful it is."

167783,"It's definitely harder, but feeling like a souls game is pushing it. I've only died a handful of times and I've just finished Arbiters Grounds.

I do like that I have to think more tactically. Stock up on potions, have more ranged battles etc."
237382,"Dark Souls fresh in my mind, I've completed it three times, and if I went back to play it right now, from the beginning, I would still die many, many times.

With Twilight Princess HD, it had been a while since I played Twilight Princess, but still have died very few times compared to Dark Souls.

Dark Souls is a lot more difficult than TP on hero mode."
243052,"But how else are they similar? Dark Souls is an RPG at heart with different weapons and armour sets, and levelling up. Legend of Zelda has none of that. Dark Souls doesn't have a dungeon system like Legend of Zelda. The only things they have in common is adventure + boss fights, but that's almost every adventure game ever."
250013,"But the combat isn't similar at all. Dark Souls is all about stamina management and has attacks with large ending lag (I think that's the right word?), where if you attack in the wrong direction, you will likely be hit before you can turn and make an accurate hit.

The Legend of Zelda is simply a lock on system where you combo multiple enemies at once.

You said hero mode made it felt more like a souls game. The only thing hero made changes is the difficulty (Well, aside from the mirroring), so naturally I assumed you thought the difficulty brought about that more souls like feel, so I brought up that it didn't make it THAT much more difficult. Now you're saying it's other aspects of the game which make it souls like, and I'm wondering why, since the games are very different."
293608,"Are you kidding? Stamina management changes everything. In Zelda I can just continue blocking against most enemies until I feel like doing something, or spam the attack button without stopping. You can't do that in Dark Souls due to the stamina bar.

Not to mention the variety of different weapons in Dark Souls change the combat completely as well. So what in the combat is similar? Zelda doesn't even have a dodge mechanic. (You can roll, but I don't believe that grants you invincibility frames)

I never said ending lag was exclusive to Dark Souls, but it's definitely not a big facet in Zelda. If I miss an attack, as long as I'm Z targeting, link will soon around and attack the enemy. That won't happen in Dark Souls.

What. That's like saying in Dark Souls ng+ isn't any harder if you don't get hit. Irrelevant, since you most likely will get hit. Either way, if it's not the difficulty, what makes hero mode more Dark Souls esque than it already may have been?

It doesn't really matter if multiple think it. I just don't see any big similarities."
312634,I'm sorry that I wanted to your see your reasoning for thinking that Dark Souls and Zelda are similar which you were unable to provide.
313264,"&gt; all I literally said was ""it feels like a souls game"" and for some reason that didn't sit well with you.

And all I said was not really, since the difficulty raise wasn't that much. Then you mention other things that aren't to do with difficulty, and I'm getting confused since you said hero mode made it more souls like. So I'll ask again, what about hero mode makes the game more Soulsesque, if not the difficulty?

&gt; People do and they are allowed to think this way.

Did I say otherwise? What's wrong with wanting an explanation for something?

&gt; Then I would suggest going back and try reading my comments again.

None of them explain how hero mode makes it more soulsesque. You said yourself it's not the difficulty raise, so what is it?"
314900,"&gt; I'm saying the two are identical and bemeaning to souls and its players.

I literally never said anything like this. Don't put words in my mouth.

&gt; Games will have similarities, it's inevitable.

That's the thing. They have about as much similarities as any two adventure games. You might as well say it feels like Dragons Dogma or anything equivalent.

&gt;  the similarities between the two and I won't repeat myself and cause another meaningless discussion loop like this one.

What similarities do they have that aren't common in almost all adventure games? Seriously, there aren't any, or if there are, very loose.

&gt; I answered your question multiple times before you even asked it in the first place.

And I've said multiple times that the similarities you find are either common amongst most adventure games or don't really make sense.

&gt; Difficulty is completely subjective to the player.

And that's completely fine, but you also said there were similarities aside from the difficulty. Specifically the combat.

&gt; To answer your last question, it has already been answered in the comments I linked earlier.

Here are those two comments:

&gt; Playing on hero mode, fairies, spirit springs, tears of light, potions, and heart pieces/containers are the only ways to heal.
Honestly, if you like your games challenging a l√° Dark Souls or Bloodbourne, I cannot recommend hero mode enough. I've gone from combat being a mindless formality, to having to think and fight intelligently, it's a fantastic addition to the game.

This ones obviously about difficulty.

&gt; I'm playing Bloodborne right now, and it's funny how it feels kind of similar playing TP HD (and tWW HD for that matter), especially in the beginning. Though I need to stop expecting my health to regen after counterattacking an enemy. :P
The loose similarities about a sickness covering the land, people turning into beasts, etc helps, too.

And this one the poster says himself is loose, but I could see it somewhat, though I wouldn't go to say that means it's Souls like.

Regardless, you specifically mentioned the combat.
