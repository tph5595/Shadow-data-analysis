17994,"I'm so excited to get my copy 2mmrw. TP is my favorite Zelda and my favorite game of all time. 

Yes it has its numerous flaws but even with all of that it still remains my favorite gaming experience ever. Phenomenal music, the atmosphere, fun and unique boss battles, great art direction, the hidden skills, and the best dungeon designs in the series IMO. And to top it all off we'll get re-experience it with gorgeous HD visuals. This will be a good weekend my friends. "
