46847,"Ok so I know this game runs at 30 fps, but I am concerned as a saw the digital foundry video showing the game having frame dips into the mid to low 20s in areas where the wii and gc stayed at 30. I am willing to sacrifice framrate for graphics to a very small degree, so I want to know, are the frame drops really terrible, or is the visual upgrade worth it and the frame drops are minimal?"
