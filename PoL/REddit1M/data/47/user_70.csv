71195,"Anyone know if you can you use the gamepad's headphone port while playing on a monitor? I know some Wii U games, including Wind Waker HD, don't let you.

My setup is 2 monitors, neither of which have speakers or audio ports, so if I can't plug my headphones into the gamepad, I can't hear the game. 

Ideally I'd play with my headphones in the gamepad, using a pro controller, on my monitor, but so few games support that."
