71589,"The most important question is, if you wait on the title screen, did they remake the video set to that amazing orchestral piece? One of the early previews didn't have it, but I thought maybe that was a prerelease build....

**EDIT:** A streamer confirms that there is no video. Terrible."

I honestly think SS has the best combat of any Zelda game. I had zero problems whatsoever."

I think maybe a lot of people's problem was that the side of the controller with all the buttons had to face the ceiling at all times. It's kind of more natural to hold it with that side facing left, and if you're not diligent to constantly hold it with upright roll, or if you don't realize you're supposed to, you'll have issues."
