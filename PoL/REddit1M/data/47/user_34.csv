235492,"Yeah, I really enjoyed WW!  I powered through it yesterday and beat the game.  There's a ton of side quests that I never finished, but I'm very to have played it through to the end and ready to move on to TP.  WW has one of the most expressive Links in any Zelda game I played - the characters and story were just great! "
