**What is Twilight Princess?**

[The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Legend_of_Zelda:_Twilight_Princess) is a Zelda game that was originally released in 2006 for the Gamecube and Wii.  It features relatively realistic art style compared to other zelda games.  The player controls Link, both in human form and transformed into a wolf.


**What's new in the HD Version?**

The [HD remake](http://zelda.com/twilight-princess-hd/) features improved graphics, an extra dungeon unlocked via [Amiibo](http://www.nintendo.com/amiibo/detail/wolf-link-amiibo), a higher difficulty and mirrored-map Hero Mode version of the game, support for some other Zelda Amiibos, support for the Wii U gamepad, and various minor gameplay improvements."
