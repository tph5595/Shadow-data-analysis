83268,"Twilight Princess is honestly my personal favorite Zelda game (I played the GameCube version). So far, this HD remake basically took the original game and made it better. It feels great seeing my favorite video game character of all time (Midna) again. I've even discovered some things that I never knew about previously, like hidden areas.

I like how you can go up walls and ladders faster. I also really like how you can open your inventory screen by pressing + instead of pressing up on the d-pad.

One thing that took me a little bit of time to get used to is that you press down on the right stick to look around in first-person. I couldn't help but think that it was the ZR button. It also took me a little bit to get used to L being the button used to talk to Midna."
