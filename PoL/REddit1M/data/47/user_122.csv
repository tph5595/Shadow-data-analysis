130397,I'm not sure.. I don't actually have the game yet. But I do agree with you.
176211,"I agree. I won't be using the amiibo that replenish hearts and arrows. I like being on the edge of my seat when I'm running low on hearts or arrows and desperately looking for pots or patches of grass.

That said, I think it will be great for new players, particularly the younger ones who might not of played a Zelda game before. It gets tricky some times!"
