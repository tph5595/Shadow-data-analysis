151783,"I've been playing it since I got the game yesterday and pretty much all the changes so far are for the better. Except they said Epona would handle better than before but the controls on Epona just seems a bit off, like there's a deadzone when you push the stick to either side when pushing upwards. It's really annoying and makes it difficult to handle her for finer turns. "
152604,I've noticed the same thing and it annoys the hell out of me. They said they would improve the Epona controls but it just got bad. The controls on the GC version were fine as they were.
