45872,"They MUST fix the first person camera rotation when configuring the camera in inverted mode (as it was set on the original GameCube game).

It turns out that when you rotate in 3rd person, the camera works as intended (as if you are moving the camera holder in Mario 64), but the head rotation (which is in 1st person) is mirrored! So if you turn left, the head turns right...  It is unacceptable if they don't fix this, because it was working fine in the GameCube version!

I haven't heard anyone complaining about this issue, but please, do. I believe it really matters. Does anyone know where can I address this to Nintendo? I really want this to be fixed."
