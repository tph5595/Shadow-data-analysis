70125,"So, this is a potentially weird question. But in the original (Wii version anyway, I assume GC was the same), the title screen had a short video (minute and a half long-ish) after the bit with Link+Epona running up to the bridge, which was various clips from the game with an amazing song. I just got the game and left it running on the title screen in hopes of seeing that again... but it isn't showing up. Just looping the basic title screen over and over. Did they cut it out because they didn't feel like doing the HD for it? If so, I am very sad... I used to leave it looping for hours at a time in college. I obviously have the song now, and youtube has some clips of the video... but I was really hoping to relive that experience with the new game :(. "
