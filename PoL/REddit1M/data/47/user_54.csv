61346,"I second Bayonetta 1/2 and DKC: TF in particular. Absolutely stellar games, among the best in their respective genres (spectacle fighter and platformer).

Haven't played Mario Maker yet, but Smash and MK8 are fun, too."
61423,"Are you sure there aren't separate sliders for the first and third person camera? Wind Waker HD had that, so it would be bizarre if TP HD doesn't.

Edit: Played myself since writing this, and there aren't separate sliders for first person/aiming and the regular camera. That's a pretty gross oversight. tWW HD has that, so why doesn't this game? I'm noticing another oversight or 2 that screams ""minimum effort/rushed"" to me, too. :\"
76322,"It's not impossible, but it would require quite a bit of reworking. It would be tricky for sure, but definitely not impossible.

As for me, I'm mostly happy with the motion controls, so I'd be fine with them going unchanged in a potential remaster."
76432,"The GameCube version did indeed have the video. It was identical except for the orientation, on-screen button prompts, and one shot of Midna that's different in both versions, for some reason.

Source: Played both versions."
76501,"This seriously upset me when I found that out earlier today. That was one of the coolest title videos Nintendo has ever done, and it's just not there. :( Really bizarre, because the song from that video is included in the limited preorder sound selection CD."
76653,"The Wii version is a mirror of the GameCube version (as others have pointed out). Aside from Link's handedness, other persistent imagery from the series is changed in the Wii version. For example, the Triforce of Wisdom and Courage are on the left and right side respectively in all the games, but on the Wii version of TP, they're swapped.

However if you really want the Wii's orientation, hero mode flips the game to be like the Wii version. I'm playing it that way right now, and it feels so weird to me since I had the GameCube version."
76894,"I'm playing Bloodborne right now, and it's funny how it feels kind of similar playing TP HD (and tWW HD for that matter), especially in the beginning. Though I need to stop expecting my health to regen after counterattacking an enemy. :P

The loose similarities about a sickness covering the land, people turning into beasts, etc helps, too."
77009,Yep. Hit select to instantly swap between on TV and off TV play.
77081,"Crazy that they were willing to mirror an entire game to cater to righties, but wouldn't even give you the option of original orientation for lefties. That couldn't be hard to implement."
77191,"Unless I'm mistaken, you only get nagged about rupees the first time you collect them, now. I exited the game twice, and didn't get any more notifications about blue and yellow rupees the way I used to on the GameCube and Wii."
77236,"You can get the bigger wallets that exist in the game already, there's just an additional wallet in this version only available with the Amiibo. Plus the already existing wallets are all bigger."
77331,"What did you press to exit the menu, 'A' or 'B'? It says ""Press 'A' to confirm,"" so I think 'B' cancels your changes."
80312,"It's been years since i looked this up, but someone developed a way to play SS on Dolphin emulator using an Xbox 360 controller. They mapped swordplay to the right stick, and tweaked other motion features in various ways to not require motion controls, without actually removing anything.

Whether most people would like that is open to debate, but it's definitely 100% possible."
80359,That's very weird. I changed my camera options multiple times and haven't had any issues. :(
80481,"I don't think it was perfect, but it was very cool, and could've easily been perfected in a sequel.

I view SS's motion controls the way I view Phantom Hourglass's touch controls: Imperfect, but with potential and fun to be had, easily ironed out with more work. Spirit Tracks buffed out about all of PH's control issues because they were able to reflect and improve. Real shame that SS's motion controls won't get that treatment. :("
80556,"&gt;Why does hero flip it?

*Shrug* I guess they think it makes the game harder by messing with your memory of how the game should orient. I think it's a stupid annoyance, personally. They did the same thing with master quest in OoT 3D."
82911,"Yep. Plus diagonal slices. Between the parries in The Wind Waker and the hidden skills in Twilight Princess, I'm pretty sure they have more sword moves than Skyward Sword."
95089,"Someone actually already did this in Dolphin emulator with a 360 controller, where the right analog stick is used for swordplay and thrusting is done by clicking the stick."
95907,"There's a *huge* difference between ""impossible"" and ""it's unlikely the developers would do this."""
98439,Yep. Master Quest on 3DS adds a mirrored world and double damage. The original Master Quest on GameCube only has the remixed dungeons.
127938,"... Again, it's already been unofficially implemented with zero changes to the base game.

I don't know why you keep saying ""it'd be too hard/impossible"" when it's already been done by freaking fans who couldn't even really edit the base game. If they can do it just by modifying inputs, surely Nintendo could do it when they could easily edit the game itself."
145819,"I can imagine. Playing a Zelda game with a mode flipped from what I'm used to kind of gives me a headache. They should've made the mirror option a separate toggle from hero mode, IMO. Then people wouldn't have to trade-off if they want one but not the other."
173292,"No problem. I notice this game is decidedly worse than tWW HD about explaining any new mechanics to the player. Off-TV play is never pointed out, you discover it yourself. Amiibo functionality suddenly appears with no indication of how to use it unless you exit the game and boot back up after it's enabled. Etc."
187390,"Yeah, it was remastered by a different developer. Thing is, this developer has experience with remastering/porting games. They made the Wii U version of Deus Ex 3, and did a stellar job with options, extra Wii U specific features, etc.. It makes no sense that that effort doesn't show in this game unless it was rushed, and/or Nintendo didn't care enough to give proper guidelines/requirements to them.

Overall, I'm pretty disappointed in TP HD so far, for a number of reasons."
