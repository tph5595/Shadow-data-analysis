103413,"Has anyone else noticed the lack of using the gamepad speakers? Midna spooking me by laughing at me through the wiimote (when my parents were asleep I'd play in the dark and with the sound low to not wake them) was one of the most memorable parts of the original, and now that I've gotten her I'm missing that aspect. I guess it's because it's largely based on the GameCube version, but it's a shame.

It also seems like I'm not noticing when her icon pops up. Isn't she supposed to giggle whenever you're standing on a spot where she can help you jump from? Or did she only do that when she has something to say?"
