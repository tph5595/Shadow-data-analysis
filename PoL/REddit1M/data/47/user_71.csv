71246,"Yeah, GS only does release day delivery with extra cost. I found this out the hard way when I was confused I didn't get my shipment today.  I tracked it online and it won't be here until Tuesday! I'm going to order the game from Amazon now and I'll get it by Monday. Then i'm going to return my copy of the game to GS (while keeping the bonus ST) when it arrives.  F Gamestop, they're the worst. "
