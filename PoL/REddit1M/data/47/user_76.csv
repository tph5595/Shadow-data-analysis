90760,What's with the ZL item slot in the item menu I wonder?
133431,"It doesn't just double damage but gets rid of heart drops too, correct?"
144293,Shame. I really want to play non-mirrored hero mode.
148648,"Tip: If the shooting without aiming is getting to you or you want to go into aiming mode faster, center the left stick before trying to take aim. You can still be moving, just make sure the stick isn't tilted when you press the button.

Really miss being able to aim and move like in WWHD."
148732,So many small things left out that would've had a huge impact. At least the game itself is great nonetheless. 
150805,I went with Hero mode. Feels like a souls game without heart drops and with increased damage. I normally play through Zelda games and only die maybe once or twice in a whole playthrough (including hero mode). I died 5 times in just the first Wolf Link sequence and then twice from falling to my death in the Forest Temple.
151956,"I'm actually missing the Wiimote. Though you can spin-attack spam now unlike the Wii version, you can't do a quick-spin on horseback without slowing down.

I've been getting by without the strafe-shooting by holding L while drawing my bow to stay moving and avoid incoming projectiles so I can fire back. Though not being able to move and shoot at the same time is quite the issue especially with beamos.

Ranged combat in this game feels like a bullet hell now given you need to stand still to aim."
152644,"People forget there are a lot of other things motion controls add to SS as well. Specifically quick drawing where instead of waiting for Link to pull the arrow all the way back, you can do this yourself instantly. There's also rolling bombs, and aiming which is so much better with motion controls since they are more flexible than a single button press which is very wonky at times, and often in Zelda games when you want to aim, you're forced to remain stationary.

Though some things that SS can do without in regards to motion controls is the swimming. It was horrible imo. Flying wasn't too much of an issue because you have so much space to work with. But when you're used to making tight maneuvers like in MM or TP underwater, you're gonna be bumping into shit a lot. 

SS has too much emphasis on motion controls and that was a major issue for a lot of people. A lot of the motion based actions just didn't make sense but the ones that did just work incredibly well. They sold SS last time with a Wiimote, I don't see why they can't do the same with SSHD **AND** have gamepad/pro controller w/o motion controls as an option given so many people use a 360 controller to play it on dolphin."
170228,"So if you hold ZR while riding Epona, Link lies forward and if you press A while doing this, he backflips right off for a quick dismount. You can also mount Epona from behind and take off at full speed instantly. Was this in the original or is it something added in the HD release?"
170881,"If you want to do a quick-spin-attack from Epona's back without stopping, press A before rotating the stick. The dash and stop animations will cancel eachother out and will allow you to do a spin attack without stopping."
171599,"I don't think it's pushing it. Like souls, hero mode isn't that hard if you know what you're doing, are skilled, and are well prepared. But you will be punished for being careless and reckless, especially early on when you have little health and 2-3 attacks are enough to kill you (like in souls). And then halfway through the game when you have a whole bunch of hearts / soul levels, the game becomes easier.

The reason souls games might seem more difficult, is because they are less forgiving, actually punish you for failure as opposed to going back to the start of the room, and unlike Zelda, you can count the number of souls games on a single hand."
177600,No idea. They opted not to include hero mode in MM. Maybe they just didn't have enough time to add in some things they would have liked to.
240891,"Going off my original comment, there's actually a faster way to do this. Just press ZL (not hold) immediately just before when pressing the item button. It sends you straight into aiming mode and works while moving. You need to be holding ZL before you use the item and then it will send you into aiming mode right when you let go."
