28836,"Yes and no. For the main story, it explains the bare bones of what you have to do at each step of the main quests, with maps and screenshots. Then there are sections outlining solutions of the shrines and side quests, plus lists of weapons, armor (and what you need to upgrade it), materials, recipes, etc. And there's a map with all the shrines on one side and all the Korok seeds on the other. "
28897,Are Guardian weapons any more effective against Guardians than regular weapons? Or just Ancient weapons? 
34469,It's also just a pretty book in its own right. That's half the reason I bought it.
34753,"Is there *any* rhyme or reason whatsoever to the blood moon? So far I've seen it rise twice in three nights, when the moon is already high in the sky, and even more than once in a single night. On at least one occasion it has ""risen"" three times in a single night: once an hour or two before midnight, once at or right around midnight, and once an hour or two after midnight. What gives?

In the latter case, I was warping around the map a lot those nights. IIRC, I haven't seen it happen more than once in a single night if I stay in the same region the whole night."
34832,"In Upland Zorana, near the stand of trees."
35026,Or you can run the gauntlet of Lizalfos on the way to Zora's Domain. Should yield about 100 arrows.
35181,I think the Fort Hateno area has several of them.
35277,"Wait, don't you have to raid Hyrule Castle for the Hylian Shield? Getting past all those Guardians?"
35723,"You can *always* find more gemstones. Just east of Lurelin Village you can find both a Stone Talus and a little cove with about eight ore deposits, including two rare-ore deposits. The ore will respawn after some indeterminate but not unreasonable amount of in-game time, and the Talus will of course respawn every blood moon."
35778,"Yeah, some of these shrines are really bending my brain and I love it."
35910,"I didn't even think of this. Luckily I've only done the Zora Divine Beast so far and I'm 99.9% sure I got all the chests. Definitely doing this for the other three, though."
35950,"Yes, the little diamond-shaped icon on the loading screen shows how many you've finished."
36057,"I think it's Chaas Qeta, on the island in the far southeast."
36447,"Many Lizalfos carry shields. In any camp or tower with several Bokoblins clustered together, at least a couple of them will have Boko Shields, Spiked or better.

Two great places to find them:

Just west of the Muwo Jeem shrine, down the hill there's a Bokoblin camp in one of those skull-shaped hollow rocks. Approach quietly from the shrine side, take out the guards with arrows. Shoot down the lantern to cause an explosion inside, then mop up whatever's left. You can get good swords and a shield or two here.

In the run-up to the Lake Tower from the north (I think) side, you'll fight through a whole bunch of Bokoblins and Lizalfos in several stages. You can get a few shields and several Lizal Bows here."
38517,Thought so. Thanks.
42957,"Right, okay. I've encountered a Stalnox elsewhere and for one crazy moment I thought maybe you meant that one."
58735,"I didn't realize that I hadn't been completely powering down my Switch; I was just pressing the button once, which puts it in sleep mode. Someone suggested/implied that powering it off every time/most times might fix the problem, so I've started doing that."
58867,"Oh, excellent! I thought that might be the case, because there's flavor text somewhere that talks about how modern weapons are less effective against Guardians than weapons from their own time, and I thought logically that should include Guardian weapons."
106053,"True enough! It still satisfies my completionist tendencies, though."
