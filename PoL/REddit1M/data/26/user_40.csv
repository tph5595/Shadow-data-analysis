16285,Is there any way to know if a blood moon is coming up besides the visual cue of a red sky during the last hour? 
16573,It was one of my favorite moments as well. One thing happened to me though that added some challenge: I got a blood moon when doing the final area. It's the second time a blood moon almost killed me. 
16806,Aight. Was hoping for something more convenient that I missed. I believe there's a puzzle that demands me to be at a certain place when the blood moon rises. Not sure though. And don't tell me if I'm right or wrong. I wanna experience it :p
