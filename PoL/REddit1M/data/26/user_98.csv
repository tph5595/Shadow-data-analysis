46774,"Has anyone been traveling around the waterfalls behind Impa's place looking for treasure chests? I have the one from the top of the mountain and in the water beneath one of the falls, but the sensor is still indicating a chest is nearby... If anyone can point me in the right direction I'd be much obliged!"
