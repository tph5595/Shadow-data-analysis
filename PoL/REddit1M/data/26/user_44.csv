16649,You'll want to look for a stable. A girl there can help you. I think it's called foothill stable. 
16671,You can't get there without some sort of flame protection 
19402,"Hmm I have no idea. I just tried with a ice spear and blizzard rod. It didn't work, but I'm at the divine beast so it's way hotter here. Might work in just a level one heat area. "
22427,"I need help with a chest in Vah Rudania. 

I think I've found every other chest and I can't seem to find this one in the guide. I've gotten all the terminals. 

It's on the underside of his front left shoulder. When he's standing normally, the chest is below me and I can stand on a gate. When he's sideways, I can stand in front of the gate, but I can't get it open. It's just below a terminal that is sideways when Vah Rudania is upright. 


A hint would be best if you can think of one. "
24905,Can you give me a hint of what I'm looking for exactly? I've been looking all over the top/side for about 20 minutes. I know I'm missing a goo to kill because I keep seeing those monsters it shoots. That's the only thing I can think of. 
27330,Adding to this: you don't need to do the goron beast first. I got the goron first. 
27403,I am really struggling to find it still 
32505,"I can't find it :( I must be understanding wrong. I'm jumping from the spines on it's back while it's sideways. The only opening I see just leads back to inside the beast and the gate is still closed. 


Edit: I found it! If anyone who is having trouble sees this- the ledge you need to jump to is on his stomach/chest. Jump off while he is sideways."
37926,Woodland tower is the closest tower. He's also in the region for that tower. 
38065,"As others have said, it's a bug. I haven't had it, but I've heard from others than you can fix it by shutting down (rather than going into sleep mode)"
38140,You're welcome! Good luck :)
45701,"Unfortunately no. The gems can be used for other things ([upgrading armor](/spoiler))

But any weapons you find can be found again! "
55037,"She is along the river. I'm pretty sure it's called Wishing Shore or something similar. If you zoom your map in all the way and search starting at zoras domain, you'll find it"
81207,"There's a kid at one of the stables that will give you one really easily. I'm pretty sure it's Dueling Peaks, but I'll have to check to be sure. That's the only one I know, but hopefully that helps!"
96130,"I will check as soon as I get home. I remember what it looks like, but not the name. "
107581,Found it! It's woodland stable. The kid is off to the side near some tables and chairs
