I did the first shrine quest with him with the arrows through the stone circles but now he's playing his accordian at every stable and keeps talking about his teacher and asking if I want to hear the one song he knows about 10,000 years ago."
84357,it's the reward for the Secret of the Cedars shrine quest you get in Hateno village. It's a girl and she's by a little dock on a pond to the side of one of the buildings. 
87546,Thank you. I guess I'll just have to keep exploring. I assumed he was just going to be at Stables till I did something but he kept playing the same song and saying the same stuff.
