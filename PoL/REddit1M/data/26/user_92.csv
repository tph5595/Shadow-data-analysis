43176,Lightning rod any good against waterblight Ganon?
83744,"What ultima said about the doublet.

As for food make sure you mix up the spicy/warm foods to increase the stacks of cold resistance, like spicy pepper + sunshroom for level 2 cold resist. Add that with the doublet and you're set.

Keep in mind your stamina decreases faster without snow shoes, as I discovered by accident lol. Not sure off the top of my head where to get em though"
83802,"I have 2... one given from a kid at some stable, and I forget where I got the other one... Most likely a chest somewhere (shrine probably, doubt it was an amiibo)"
84365,don't have the gear so I can't tell but wouldn't each piece just provide one level of resistance?
84447,"Going to Kakariko sets you on a path to unlock a few things, such as memory hunting, and upgrading your slate to get the camera, compendium, bombs/stasis/sensor upgrades"
84476,Stand behind the counter and talk to her... took me way too long
84537,"Mainly as references, Tingel, Ankel and Davdi islands, there's an area named after Sahasralah, as well as a TON of old Zelda references (Labrynna, Holodrum, Koholint, and more)"
84550,Batman
84698,"I think I just got the ones you did (one lodged at the top and needs magnesis to get, and one in the water behind her house)... Didn't have sensor set to chests :S If you do stumbled across it, lemme know. I'll do the same"
84757,"Oh I figured, I just had one in my inventory and was curious if I should bring it with me to the fight (lightning -&gt; water and all)"
84773,I don't have nearly enough of those... Amiibos seem to favor fire and ice ones
84820,I read you need to play through the that cave of trials or whatnot that the amiibo unlocks to level him up
84877,Is she not showing up on your map? I've ditched the poor girl in random areas so many times and she'd stay there until I registered her... Then I could ditch her to my heart's content
84958,"Well I've found him for my second time (after first meeting him) on the path to his final location... If that helps at all, without giving anything away"
84999,Did you also happen to have snapped pics of them for the compendium and then deleted them and then got mad when you learned about this quest like I did? cuz effin YAY lol
85077,"What he said... Some quests, I didn't realize were shrine quests (Naydra) until I did it... Others, like escorting that damn orb around the spiral beach started on its own... Or I think I read the sign beside it, I forget."
85113,"Self-loathing over your completionist nature ;) But yeah, tracking, and maybe some sort of proof of completion I assume"
85199,"How/where can I get pics of the fire/ice/bomb/ancient arrows? I can't drop em to take a pic and pick em back up like my other weapons.Shock were easy cuz of the lynel quest.

Wait, CAN you get pictures of them? I assume so, cuz why only take a pic of one.

EDIT: WAIT! Are there some shops that have em I can take a pic of them there?!"
85333,It's happened to me while I slept and woke up at noon... still got the moon cutscene
85379,"Can you dye the amiibo outfits? I just sold a duplicate Tunic of the Wind and just thought about this, in case I wanted to make the classic red/blue/purple tunics"
85456,"I will, legit just thought about the edit when I remembered some regular arrows can be seen on the ground"
85500,"No problem. also, I'd double check that you have to mix different foods to stack resist. I think just cooking more of the same one just gives you more hearts or longer durations"
87961,Tried that ;) didn't see the arrow. Ok well I'll just check out the shops I've been to (not many) and figure out what to do with ancient arrow when I get to it
92530,"I get fairies whenever I can, and have some elixirs from a few quests... What does that have to do with my comment? Am I missing something?

Oh, the fight itself? I've not tried it yet lol. Was just wondering if I should bring that weapon or not :P"
100715,yup. thankfully crappy pictures count... Took one from akalla tower of a blurry flyer
100753,I'm sure I'll buy all his pics once I have more disposable coin... Do his pics overwrite yours? or can you accidentally overwrite his
100793,"I walked into the room. Saw him, took a blurry picture of his shoulder (for the compendium) and ported the heck out of there... Actually, it's how I discovered you can port from almost anywhere, even while gliding"
135694,On the WiiU as well... Try going back to the area you last remembered leaving her
