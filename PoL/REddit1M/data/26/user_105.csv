55353,"I think I'm decently far into the game. Nearing 50 shrines now. Am I supposed to have found an upgrade for my inventory space yet? Is it obvious and I just missed it? Or am I supposed to play through the game with only 8 weapon slots. 

Could someone point me in the right direction of the upgrades using a vague hint rather than flat out telling me where it is? I want to find it myself but I'm getting lots of really strong weapons now, so a little help would be great."
55676,Thank you! Wow that's where they put it?? You'd think they would put it in kakariko or some virtually unmissable place. Especially in a game like this which encourages sidetracking so much.
56022,I guess I can understand that. Thanks for giving a specific but also open point in the right direction. Hunting now...
