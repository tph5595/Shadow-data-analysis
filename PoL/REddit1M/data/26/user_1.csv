451,"Is there any way to stop the yiga attacking you?
I mean, its all nice and exciting when they are travelers in disguise but after the hideout-quest they get really annoying. My girlfriend made the mistake and did the gerudo divine beast at frist and now they are everywhere... They pop up at the most inappropriate times like when she fights an hinox or something. There must be a way to stop this. I hope :-("
