81953,"I am a noob in the game, having just completed the first forgotten memory (the one you find next to the eastern, stone gate and where Ganon returns to Hyrule) and I would like to explore the mountain area directly to the east. For this my current clothing, Champion's Tunic and Hyrule clothing, and some spicy meat/seafood just doesn't cut it. Where can I get better armour/higher level food for cold resistance? I have only unlocked the plateau, the central map (Central Tower) and the Zora's and Kakoriko ""maps"" via the towers. Do I need to go elsewhere for this?"
