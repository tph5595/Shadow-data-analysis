7736,"a good/useable strategy is to use upgraded bomb runes to kill most of the enemies on the island, to avoid using arrows and weapon durability. there are at least one or two Rock Octoroks that if you're lucky, will spit out a Royal weapon if you throw a Rusty weapon in its gob while its sucking in. if you have upgraded stasis, you can freeze the hinox (i think!) for like 1 second to get a shot on its eye. if you need more arrows, you can always farm them from bokoblins missing you."
8244,"a well aimed arrow might also sever his necklace and cause it to roll off. i know you can cut their weapon necklaces usually, and also grab them when they fall on the ground after hitting their eye. maybe you can grab the orb then?"
8531,"if you have amiibos that give you classic armor, you'll definitely want to hold onto certain gems. Ocarina armor uses amber to level up, Twilight uses Topaz, and i think NES Armor uses Rubies. level 4 amber earrings also provide an insane 28 defense, i almost never take them off."
