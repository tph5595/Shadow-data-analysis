8856,"There are multiple dragons in the game like the one you saw. You can't kill them (to my knowledge). Depending where on its body you hit it with an arrow yields a scale, shard, or fang which can then be used for armor upgrades or to access a shrine. 



If I was you I would make a stamp on your map, try and hit it with an arrow and continue on your way. "
