19357,"Same. I currently have no shield so I'm hesitant to go into Hyrule Castle or even into a test of strength shrine until I have something semi-decent. The only shield I've founds recently is a ""rusty shield"" and it lasted approximately 2 minutes. "
19557,"Yep. I think the only place they don't respawn is in chests inside shrines. I made notes about where certain items live in the overworld so if I find myself needing one I know where I can quickly find one. For example, whenever I need a torch or an axe to chop trees, I travel to the Shrine of Resurrection and both are sitting in the cave nearby where you initially meet the old man. "
20365,"Are the amiibo worth it? It seems a bit unfair that amiibo offer so much to improve the gameplay, like early access to better horses or armor. It seems in the past amiibo have added fun, but completely unnecessary, items to games but BOTW is actually offering some decent stuff that makes the game easier."
20445,"All of them? The description of luminous stones mention that it can be used as a base for special clothing, so I've been holding on to those. But the rubies/sapphires/topaz just mention that they fetch a high price."
20628,"I started wondering if diamonds have a purpose after a Zora sidequest. I traded 10 luminous stones for 2 diamonds, which was a great deal. But the NPC said at any point in the future I can bring him 10 more luminous stones for 1 diamond. Cost-wise, that isn't a great deal because 1 diamond is worth 500 rupees which is less than the 700 rupees I could get by selling 10 luminous stones. 

So not a great trade if you're looking to make money, but it seemed like it was setting up an easy way to farm diamonds when you need them for something.

(Although I found like 4 diamonds in ores on Death Mountain!)"

20935,Agreed. I'm trying to go slow on the main quest and complete as many shrines as I can. I think the shrines are great. They have some really great puzzles that use the runes in unique ways. A couple have really stumped me and it makes me feel great when I figure it out.
22751,"Well that makes me feel better. I think I read something about how you can easily get the Hylian shield early with amiibo and I was like boo, not fair."
