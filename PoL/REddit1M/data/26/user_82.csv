36114,The ability to track everything in the compendium. There is no other reward. 
36131,A single inventory item that does nothing.
53406,"Oh, I know. I speak Japanese; the pun you're referring to is ""うんこ,"" meaning ""poop,"" starting with the same two syllables as ""運,"" meaning ""luck."" A golden poop is a symbol of good luck; in fact, the item you get from completing the Korok seeds looks just like an [actual golden poop good luck charm](https://shikibook.files.wordpress.com/2013/09/golden-poo1.jpg). It just has no proven effect in the game (I'm a long time Souls player, so I'm *extremely* skeptical of ""players think"" or ""people say"" statements about mysterious items in video games. I still haven't forgotten you, Pendant!)."
