17375,Just the armor amount. It's useful early in the game and cheaper than getting those whole sets I think
17432,You can make accessories and diamonds are used by a few people to fix special weapons
17483,The Great Fairy says she can only improve your armor a little bit right now. You need more Great Fairies
35307,I think you have a bug. AFAIK it's based on how many enemies you kill or how long you explore
35373,Trail to Zoras has one in a cutscene. Also the abandoned equestrian training ground has them IIRC
35526,Luminous stones are used for a set of armor you can find
100686,Gerudo has an accessory store and the special weapons you get after beating divine beasts need a diamond to repair
