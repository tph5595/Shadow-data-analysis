4099,"I restarted my save after beating Ganon, this time turning off most of the HUD (HUD mode set to ""Pro"", which turns off basically most of the display except for your hearts) opting to go in a different directio off the plateau this time, and most importantly without making use of quick travel.

Already it's been an exciting experience. The world is so damn vast that just running around on foot keeping an eye out while going, I've found things and seen areas I'd simply never seen before because of quick travel. I ended up chasing after something that caught my interest, then got chased by some large mobs and when I finally stopped to figure out where I was, I'd completely lost the main road (which is surprisingly easy when you don't have a minimap and haven't hit the tower yet). That was a unique and very fun feeling.

Take your time this time around! See the sights, look around! Venture off the road, find out what's on top of that outcropping, or is glowing in the distance. And don't quick travel (unless absolutely necessary, like that one shrine in the lava lake in Death Mountain). Talk to everyone, find out their names and story. That's how I'm doing it, and I'm loving it more and more every day."

Add to it needing to constantly check the sky to see what time it is and what weather you might be expecting, and it's a delightful change of pace."
