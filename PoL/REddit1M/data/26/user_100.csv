48331,"[May contain Spoilers] - depending on how little you are trying to learn of the game.
No improving weapons other than finding betters ones, no restoring durability. The gems are for something else, though the rarest gem (the one that sells for the most) can be used to obtain certain weapons back again through an NPC (or multiple, I'm not sure, but for one weapon specifically). Though the weapon I'm referencing is very easily trumped by other weapons.

The only crafting from yourself is cooking, then there are vendors that use certain materials (one that uses rupees, one that doesn't along with the materials) to be able to buy their items, then another set of NPCs (3 of them) that upgrade your armors using specific materials (mostly all different for each piece)."

In a normal cycle, the 30 min before the cut scene, your cooking critical success is increased, which would normally be 11:30pm-11:55pm on the night of the blood moon. Bloodmoon should technically only happen at midnight sharp of which ever nights it's supposed to happen. From the real life days that I've played, I've only had the bloodmoon a handful of times which has been out of months of in-game time I'm sure."

Remember, if you're practicing, you can save fight for a while and reload the save to when you had all shields again. Did that when fighting guardians, save immediately before the fight, if I lost too many shields or food, reload"
