32161,"I have the same problem. Had over 200 arrows, bought all arrows I could find and now the last 20 hours, not a single merchant restocked arrows.

I have 20 arrows left and even after multiple blood moons, they won't restock them anymore.

Seems like a bug. Now I have to farm enemies at Zoras domain for arrows, which sucks. Not even beedle has arrows anymore."
