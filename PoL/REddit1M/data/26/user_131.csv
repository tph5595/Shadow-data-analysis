85635,Yes you can purchase them at certain merchants (specific towns sell specific arrows) but you can get a pic of them there. The only arrow I have not seen sold out in the open are the ancient arrows. I know picture item identification works when you take selfies (it will identify the weapon on your back) - perhaps try to take a selfie with those certain arrows equipped and see if they get picked up?

94118,Worst case scenario is you buy the image from the guy at the tech lab (I forget his name). I think he gives you random images but if you're doing it to be a completionist then it's a definite option.
115039,"Honestly I'm not sure, I think he only fills in the items you haven't captured. I have yet for him to overwrite any of mine. And yes you can overwrite his pictures BUT it asks you if you want to replace the current image in your album before you save it.

TAKE PICTURES OF THE BOSSES. I don't think he gives you them, just an FYI. I forgot to snap one of the first boss I fought and I think I'm SOL :( unless someone else here knows a secret I don't?"
