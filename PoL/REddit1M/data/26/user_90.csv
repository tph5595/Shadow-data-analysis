41111,What are energetic rhino beetles good for? Is there a quest I missed that needs energetic rhino beetles?
41750,"The northern plains of Lindor mountain by Serenne Stable has the 3 best horses in the game so far: 535, 445, 253. You end up riding the 253 most of the time, except when you want a warhorse, then you end up riding the giant horse with 52- stats, because he'll run over stuff and kill them or dismount them in the process. Note that the giant horse's 2 speed stat is a lie, as he's as fast as a 4 speed horse that's not sprinting.

Epona is only a 444 horse and the royal white horse is only a 435 horse."
