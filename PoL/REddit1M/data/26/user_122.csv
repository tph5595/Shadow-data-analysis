73040,"Okay so for the heat there is the second desert outfit. You have the Desert Vai outfit for doing the dungeon and getting into Gerudo Town. But the 2nd variation (the Voe outfit) is part of a side quest in Gerudo Town about a Secret Club

As for the cold resistant, I'd recommend Rito Village and its armour shop. Fully equipping that should protect you against the cold. I have yet to find a place I can not go with it and I have done all but the Central region

Finally for Death Mountain there is a shop there that prevents Flame (aka Super Hot temperatures)

Hope this all helps!

EDIT: Also it is recommended to have resistant food just in case. Sometimes you might need a suit of armour that does not offer protection (for example the Climber's Gear)"
73197,There is a Royal Guard's Armor? Are there any images of what it looks like?
73416,"You are rewarded by going off and doing your own thing. The only reason I even have done the Divine Beasts is because I have run into them as I travel around collection Korok Seeds and Shrines. 

I have barely spent any time on side quests either. And I have spent over 100+ hours so far. And I love every bit

So no, you are not missing anything. In fact, you'd be missing everything if you focused only on the main quest"
73592,I have just checked and yes it does give you two ticks of temperature
73724,"Star Fragments are probably the toughest material to collect in the game. And if you are going to upgrade all suits of armour you need a lot of them

Does anyone have any tricks or tips for getting them? I know about the Colosseum and the Shooting Stars but any Chest locations with them or easy-gets are highly appreciated!"
81262,"I'll check that out during my lunch break. And hey, every single Star Fragment helps. I need 160+ of the blighters XD"
85000,I have 10 (I think) so I will take a photo the moment my lunch break hits
85406,"No idea, but I'd recommend giving it a try!"
88162,Tried Dueling Peaks and it wasn't that one. Maybe it was another one? 
159923,"As you walking around Gerudo Town, try entering every door that is closed. One of them will not let you in. That triggers the quest"
159933,Checking this out at lunch!
160999,Any tips against the Silver Lynel? How do they differ from the other variations?
