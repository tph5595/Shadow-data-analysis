22414,"The armor sets you get from Amiibo are all generally reskins of each other. The set you get for [clearing all shrines](/spoiler) is better, as well as the ancient armor. Epona is alright, but kind of unnecessary when you can get the white horse 5 minutes after leaving the Plateau. Weapons you get from amibos are dwarfed by weapons dropped from easily farmable lynels late game, and the rest are just pointless ingredients.  "
41594,Which bow?
77486,How much damage does it do? Any special effect?
81422,"*royal guards arms, I believe. No armor. You have to bring weapons from the Royal Guard series found in the castle. Best gear in the game besudes lynel stuff, but it breaks quickly."
81507,Don't listen to this guy. The answer is actually nah. 
81548,You listed the main characters.
81641,The point where the inventory upgrade sidequest starts is on the road to Kakariko.

82512,Anything will fall before you run out of bombs.
82547,Only one hinox on the island.
82843,"Record is more like 48 minutes. Some crazy exploits, man."
84565,Only one hinox on Eventide island. You're thinking of a different shrine quest.
123389,I can always just buy another one...
123467,"Yea, but it was half-assed. They spent all this time making this awesome game, then were like ""Oh shit, we gotta put this in somewhere."""
