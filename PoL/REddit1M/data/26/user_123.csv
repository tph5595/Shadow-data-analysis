Without giving anything specific away, if you head there, pay attention there and in the surrounding area and follow the directions of a main character in the village to do something elsewhere, you'll gain access to 3 different, but very useful things. I'd say that doing the task that is elsewhere and getting the reward from that marks a very good spot to then continue ignoring the main questline to your heart's content."
