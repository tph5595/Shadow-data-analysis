It's not fast when you're using weapons with 5 damage, but it's only about a 10 minute fight."
12503,"It does the same thing as every other Zelda game, if you have any previous experience.

If not - then the answer is that it resets you before the boss fight and pretends like it never happened."

Even though they aren't really an (important) aspect of the story - they still feel like the core gameplay experience of the game to me. People complain that there were only 4 small dungeons in this game, but seem to forget that there were 120 extra micro-dungeons which *more* than make up for it."

12906,"Mine are definitely not getting less. I had one pop up while fighting a silver Lynel. Had to just politely ask the Lynel bro to wait while I took care of this fool.

Then I took a trip up to the plateau because I thought I'd look for some seeds, hadn't been there since the tutorial - and I got a triple chain of brute Yigas. Super annoying, they just spawned one after the other."

Hopefully you enjoy this enough to go back and play the other games."
13093,"Yep sure is. The game does a soft reset.

Early in the game with mobs it feels frustrating. I remember clearing Hyrule Field of Guardians and feeling like a boss and being sad when they were back again. Now I get excited for every blood moon because it means I can go get more parts."
13773,"Was that one just outside of the plateau? With one blue bokoblin and the rest red? I also died like 10x there before just noping out and wondering how on earth I was going to survive this game lol.

It gets a lot better. "
14622,"Honestly I like the dungeons how they were. I like the break from the formula. They fit in with the game thematically here. It wouldn't make sense to have traditional dungeons in this game.

The DLC will add the cave of ordeals style trial which will be brutal in this game, so I think that will scratch the itch for people who wanted more fighting heavy dungeons. I just prefer the puzzle aspect."
