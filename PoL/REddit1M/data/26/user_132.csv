86422,Does sneakstrike have a specific damage modifier percentage increase? I'm trying to determine whether getting the stealth suit is worth it and knowing the amount of damage the sneakstrike provides would help me make a more informed decision. I'm sure there is a limit to which it can provide a one-hit kill.
