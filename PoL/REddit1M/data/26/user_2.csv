1363,Good places to get shields?  Practicing parrying is not going well....
7614,I've gone through 2 ancient shields already.  Is there any list of shrines that have shields? Minor/Modest I'm guessing. I usually end up with spear/axe/sword in majors.

I lived, they died.  Mipha helped.

I feel like a solo Stalnox is cake comparatively!"
