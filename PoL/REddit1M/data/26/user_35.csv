I wouldn't try to start this process until you get some heart upgrades and decent gear to deal with the damage you will possibly suffer from this undertaking, as it will hurt *a lot.*"

15252,Go get the Hylian Shield from the Lockup in the lower levels of Hyrule Castle.  Can tank Guardian lasers for *days* before breaking.  Finished a full run of all four Divine Beasts and the final boss before the shield started to break.

My advice before you take the venture?  Upgrade your Stasis rune.  Makes the Stalnox fight (which *has* to be done to get the shield) far more manageable, since the upgrade can freeze enemies."
