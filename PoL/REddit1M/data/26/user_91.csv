41523,"So I just picked up Twilight Princess HAD with the Wolf Link Amiibo($55 bucks, down from $80,sweet deal). 

Now I know if I don't use the Wolf Link in TP first then when I use it in BOTW it'll only have 3 hearts, but will it always have three hearts even after I do finally use it in TP for the first time? Or will I be able to get my twenty hearts after using it in TP? 

Sorry if this is confusing. Just wondering if I can use it right now for fun or should wait till I play TP."
45006,Ok thank you. I wanted to make sure because I already screwed myself out of Epona by not registering her and leaving her somewhere and now I haven't been able to get her back. So I didn't want to get stuck with a three heart Wolf Link for the whole game.

I accidentally killed a horse on purpose (like it wasn't struck down in battle but killed by my lightning sword and the horse God was giving me all kinds of shit for it. 

Also when I told him I had an endura carrot and he discovered I didnt..""come back when you're not a liar!"""

I k ow that if I catch a random horse I can leave them wherever I go and leave them for hours even and yet they'll still be there when I get back, but it's only so long as I don't shut of the game. Once I do that, it's gone. 

Also playing on the Wii U, don't know if that makes a difference."
