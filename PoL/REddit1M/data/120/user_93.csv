64721,"Quest help needed: Royal White Stallion. 
I am not sure if it's a glitch or anything...I did find where the white horse was, and while I was taming her we slipped off the cliff. It was rainy and the horse was freshly tamed so we cannot climb up the cliff, and I thought I can wait until next blood moon and return. I then warped away and hope to tame her again in when I return to the region.
However, regardless of several bloody moons, switching the game on and off, the white horse no longer appears. I tried setting up campfire and waited along in the park nearby and keep reloading, and what I can see is the white horse appear for several seconds and disappear immediately.
Does this mean I lost my white horse forever ? "
