19540,"I'm currently hunting for my last 10 shrines, and I have no clue where any of them could possibly be. I think 8 of them are shrine quests, but I feel like I've talked to everyone in every village and stable by now. It's like this is going to take me a whole other 50 hours to complete.

For those of you who've gotten all 120: should I resort to cross-referencing a completed map (to get the rough location of all the shrines), or should I continue hunting? If so, any tips?"

I will say that durability in general becomes less of an issue the more you progress. I have powerful weapons that have been sitting in my inventory for what feels like ages."
21578,This is *exactly* what I was looking for. Thank you so much!
21859,"I'll put it behind a spoiler tag: [The Master Sword has a finite amount of 'energy', so it eventually will 'break' and require around 15 minutes or so to recharge. You can't use it in that time, but it becomes available in your inventory again once the timer's up.](/spoiler)"
94840,"Haha, yeah, thanks. I have 8 more, apparently, but I don't know where any of the triggers are."
