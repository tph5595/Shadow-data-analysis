78804,"SPOILERS!!! Question about lost woods: Is there more to do there besides getting the master sword, the three shrines, expansion guy and the few quests from the kokiri? Just wondering if it's worth exploring the woods since it's such a pain. Please avoid answering with a spoiler answer if there is more to it, just say yes or no so I can find out for myself! Thanks! :)"
