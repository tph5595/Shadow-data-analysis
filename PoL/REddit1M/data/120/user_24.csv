For the most part, they only ever give birth to girls, with one male born every 100 years. This could mean that they only ever produce Ganondorfs when they produce males at all, or it could just mean that he's their most notable male.

But for the most part, they're an all-girl Desert Amazon group that produces daughters almost 100% of the time."

If they produce daughters almost 100% of the time and rely on finding mates outside Gerudo, what the hell is a pure-blooded Gerudo?

You're taking phenotypes as more important than they are."
