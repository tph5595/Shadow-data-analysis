30749,"Hello,

So I got a quick question. Well I'm generally confused.

I completed try plateau starting area, and I got a main quest to find a person on the east side of the map. As an avid adventurer I ignored the main quest and I went west. There I found a stable, and I got a couple of side quests. One asks me to find a gourmet meat and one to find a white horse.

Fair enough. I marked the quest for the meat quest and the indicator points me the start of the quest and not in the general area I should go to complete it. With this massive world, I feel kind of lost. 

What's the deal with this? What am I doing wrong? Cause I'm still lost on the gourmet meat and I spent hours around that area hunting and breaking my boss with out any luck!

I'm not asking for the game to grab my hand and point me to the destination, but the vague clues like ""west of the mountain"" are killing me.

Help? (Please no spoilers, thanks)
