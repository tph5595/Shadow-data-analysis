9920,Large cores are so scarce you may really regret selling

15013,"Talk to the man in the ""window"" while on horseback.  Involves getting close to him and using ZL+A"
35569,"Pikango will be at a stable near it and give you a clue.  So... examine your stables, and always talk to him!

Edit: that's a general hint for most (all?) memories but I'm positive it applies to the bottom right because that's how I found it.  

If you want a hint of where to find the stable let me know."
39693,"In my case I did not find this stable until way late in the game.  Which is crazy because it's not out of the way at all.  Wetland Stable between Central Hyrule and Lanayru Wetlands.  Maybe Pikango isn't always always there, but he gave me my clue there for that last picture, which is (sorta) nearby."
39792,"And if you flub the dive and end up parasailing, you can release the sail and fall into the center which usually counts.  "
40358,"Awful hard to say which 20 you are missing if you've gotten 100 so far!  Some of the trickier ones are in Hebra, I feel.  But those are also very remote, and Hebra doesn't have a lot of shrines (for its size).

Here's an idea to consider since you want hints and don't think you've done all the shrine quests.  Consult a list of 42 shrine quests, compare to your Adventure Log, and contemplate the name of the quests you are missing.  The names themselves are vague and might be like little riddles that send you in the right direction.  Then also, you can come here for clues on specific quests that we can help with.  

[Here](https://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/632936-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/75119510) is the list I like because it is in the same sort order as the Adventure Log."
40429,Glad to help.  It was the hardest one for me too.  
42567,"The real value of rock salt is that its description is the smoking gun that BOTW is after WW on the timeline.  ""Crystallized salt from the ancient sea"" -troll"
42896,He will set up camp at night in the outskirts of various villages.  Northwest of Gerudo Town he's pretty prominent.  
44420,"Oh I'm sorry I misunderstood.  You have not finished the ""A Shady Customer"" quest then, so I don't believe that Kilton travels yet.  I believe you need to return to that skull eye again after midnight, take picture, show picture, complete quest. "
44943,11 fairies can't hurt either!
45975,"When I went on my 40 Talus medal run, I was astounded at the amount of ore I collected.  But obviously that burns weapons.  Possible but challenging to take down Talus only with bomb runes.

Tip: you've noticed the difference between Ore, Rare Ore, and Luminous, I assume.  Take pictures and set your Shiekah Sensor to the Rare Ore photo to get the high value gems.  

Soon enough you will have more rupees than you know what to do with"
46553,"Anytime.  My game is complete, and I'm enjoying helping others here (and IRL) as best I can.  "
