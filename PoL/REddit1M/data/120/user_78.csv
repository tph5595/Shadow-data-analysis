41336,Any real value for rock salt? Trying to max out my armor so I'm doing some major ore mining. Got a crapload of rock salt and it seems like it has barely any value in cooking
44327,Ya I noticed that in my googling. Pretty neat I love those little pieces of lore. Still seems like a useless item. Filler for ore mining. Sell it all I guess? Keep a few for random dishes I guess 
44454,To get the true ending do you need anything more than all the memories plus all 4 beasts?
44532,Seems super useful to me. Rocking the amber earrings. Maxed out they get you +28 armor!
44765,Yes yes yes. It's scary and fun. I did exactly this recently just at about the exact same spot as you

Climb some towers to unlock maps. Keep doing what you're doing exploring on your own and going to any place that seems interesting. In my opinion the main quest is fun stuff so get to that eventually. "
