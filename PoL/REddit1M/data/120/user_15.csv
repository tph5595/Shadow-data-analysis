8775,"Is there an issue with blood moon? I had the blood moon cutscene happening at... 4:30PM in the game. Even better, I was fighting an electric Lizalfos and he hit me, making me drop my shield and sword. The cutscene happened out of nowhere, and... My weapon and shield on the floor disappeared. Is that a rare bug?"

Is the true ending really different, or is it just something extra? As in is it worth it to finish it once for the regular ending and then a second time to see the true ending?"

Haha same, I've actually forced myself to go fight some Lynels etc to actually use my weapons because lately every time I find a cool weapon in a shrine I have to ditch another cool weapon :P"
