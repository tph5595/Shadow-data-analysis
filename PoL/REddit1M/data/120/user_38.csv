16210,"about gems, most of them are used for tier 4 armor upgrades. It's pretty late game and by the time you'll get there you'll be rolling in gems from taluses and silver ennemies :

you'll need 30 topaz for the rubber set, 15 ruby for the rito outfit, 45 opals for the zora set, 90 amber for the hylian set ans 15 sapphire for the desert voe outfit. Diamond are used if you wanna reforge unique weapons.

also you''l need 22 of each if you ever wanna fully upgrade jeweries (47 for the opal earrings and 63 for the amber earrings). Buying price is between 3 and 10 depending of gem rarity. Keep in mind it also require star fragments for tier 3 and 4 (except amber and opal)

You'll need a whole lot of luminous stones to buy and upgrade the radiant set (46 per piece). you can also trade 10 of them for a diamond at the zora domain, but it's better to sell them as is.

There's a gerudo at the goron village that will buy a specific type of gems for about 10% more compared to standard shops (between topaz and diamond) by batches of 10 after you've finished the divine beast. It will change randomly each time you sell something to her or over time.

The rest you can sell.

22034,It's not really clear. It seems linked with the number of divine beast finished / the number of ennemies killed
