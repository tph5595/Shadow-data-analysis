15005,"Does [this song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7iPDTC8oOM) from the trailer ever get played in the game? I had hoped it might show up in the end credits or something, particularly the bit around 2:44. If not then that's sort of a bummer since we'll probably never get a clean official version from Nintendo. Fortunately this guy did a [recreation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZsbtOZWG4o) that is almost as good."

On a related note, there was a Gerudo prisoner locked up at the beginning of the Yiga Hideout. But I never found a key or anything. Is there a way to break her out?"
