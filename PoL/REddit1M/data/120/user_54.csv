27183,"Is the a map of the game with all the locations on it available to download somewhere? I've seen a couple by IGN and zeldadungeon but I need something I can write/paint on as I check the locations I have already registered; I think I'm missing some since I'm at 98.92% and, as far as I know, I have done everything else (including things that don't count towards the 100% such as getting every armor and upgrading every piece to the max) "
74046,I mention that site in my post but it's of no use for me since the map can't be downloaded and you can't write on it; even though you can tag the Koroks seeds or shrines as completed you can't do so with the locations.
