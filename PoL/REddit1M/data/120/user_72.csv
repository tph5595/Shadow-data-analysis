37683,"IIRC, one of Gerudos in BOTW mentions her husband in present tense. I think she says something about how she comes to Gerudo town to sell, but her husband isn't allowed. This implies she lives outside Gerudo town (at least part of the time) and that her husband is still alive. So maybe some/most Gerudos kill/banish their husbands and live in Gerudo town, but not all. 


There are several children in Gerudo town so either their fathers live outside town or are dead. 


The way they talk about finding a husband and men in general, I'd think they don't kill their husbands. To me it seems more like they're looking for love/marriage rather than just someone to give them a baby. "
39518,The part about the married Gerudo? She's to the left in the main square iirc. Right across from the cooking pots and next to the cooking class building. I think you have to talk to her from behind the counter or she'll just ask if you want to sell. 
39723,"Can I get some hints on where to find some shrines/quests? I don't want exact locations, but some hints. 


I've tried looking at stables and around towns. I've looked from all the towers, but don't see any. I have about 20 left to find. 


I know I'm missing some shrine quests, but I'm not sure if they are shrines I've gotten, but missed the quest. "

63604,I've only gotten him like twice so probably! Both times I found him close to roads so I guess I'll do some searching along roads tomorrow.
