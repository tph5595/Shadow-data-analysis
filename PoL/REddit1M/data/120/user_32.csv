14952,"Once you've mounted a horse and tamed it to the point that you can ride it places, walk up to any stable press ZL+A and talk to the man in the center of the front of the stables. (He's also the guy who sells you a bed on the inside). Once talking to him, you can register your horse and get a saddle for 20 rupees and then either have them keep the horse or you can keep riding it. Hope this helps. "
