6562,Yes. In fact if you want the true ending you have to go there once without facing Ganon.
10439,"Without spoiling, to get the true ending you need to complete all main quests.

One objective for a main quest is inside the castle, and you have to go back talk to someone after having completed the objective, so you can't save it for last, else you won't get the true ending.

I'm not sure how clear that is so I'm gonna put the unobsfucated version in a spoiler tag :

[You need to complete all main quests to get the true ending, so you need to get all the memories. One of the memories (the 12th) is located in Hyrule Castle. You can't save this picture for last because once you get all the pictures you have to go back to talk to Impa, which will reveal to you the location of one final memory. So you're forced to go in and out in the castle at one point if you want the true ending.](/spoilers)"
66417,"I don't think so. To my surprise, you don't need to complete find the fairy fountain despite it being a main quest, so all memories and all beasts should cover everything."
74011,Upgrade his armor to level 3.
74099,"You don't need a strategy, it's not that hard and it kills the fun of figuring out yourself. Just do it !

Here's a hint tho, if you really want : [You don't need to kill the Hinox, you can steal his orb](/spoilers)"
74193,"You just need food, and maybe upgrade your armor at the Fairy Fountains if you haven't done it yet.

Hearty food makes you pretty much unkillable."
74323,Everyone knows the true endgame is Fashion Souls.
74386,"It's just an additional scene after the standard ending, so you don't need to complete the game two times, you will see both."
