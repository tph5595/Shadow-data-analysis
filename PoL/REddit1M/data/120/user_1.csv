1523,"So here's a situation: there's a Korok Seed inside this block of ice. The block of ice is on some shallow water. After hitting it with some Fire Arrows, the ice block becomes really small, below the water level.

Now I can't hit it again with a Fire Arrow because it's quickly put out by the water. What should I do? :S"
