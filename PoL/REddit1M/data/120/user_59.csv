29592,"I have put in 60+ hours and unlocked all of the map except one section, but I feel like I'm just not *good* at the game. I have been putting off the main quests to explore, have one divine beast (Medoh), have 12 heart containers, have the Zora and Rito and Champion outfits, all of my weapons are 30+.. but I still feel like stronger enemies just decimate me with ease. I have yet to defeat my first Lynel or Talus, only have a Guardian or two under my belt, and even Lizalfos take me down pretty easily in some parts of the world. I guess I just need pointers? If I go back to the beginning and follow the roads everywhere will I be better prepared?"
