39148,"I felt the same as you for a long time, still do to a degree but there's been some improvement. Have you upgraded your clothing and armor? It helps a lot. I wiped the floor with Ganon from having my champion tunic maxed out. Stuff like the trick with cooking 5 banana hands giving you a high level attack boost for something like 4-5 minutes (and bananas can be found aplenty growing on trees in the jungle region). Also yes, one cool or annoying feature of the game, depending on who you are, is the combat actually does take some skill, therefore practice. Timing dodges and figuring out tricks for getting the upper hand on enemies, ie you can attack immediately from a sprint, kind of a dash attack. Arrows when enemies are out of range or have (annoying... ass.. motherfucking...) spears. I've yet to get competent at shield parrying but it seems useful. Also don't feel bad, Lizalfos just suck :)"
39388,It's also a constant source of bananas :)
39499,Definitely worth it. There's a very nice shield there.
