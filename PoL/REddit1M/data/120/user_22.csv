21462,"When I got down to my last 10 shrines or so, I used [this map](https://imgur.com/m0zacxO) to narrow my search. This way you can still discover them on your own, but not waste hours searching areas that you've already completed. (Link Between Worlds had an in-game version of this when collecting Maimais; I wish they'd carried it over to BotW for shrines and/or Koroks.)"
22898,"If you've done all of the other shrines, you'll be fine. You do lose all of your items (temporarily) which requires you to scavenge for new weapons and food on the island to complete the quest. 

This can be really tough early on (I went with four hearts and got wrecked) but by now you have tons of hearts and a pretty good idea of how the game works, so you should have no problem fighting some enemies with minimal equipment.

One thing I will tell you is that you can't save on the island, so make sure you set aside 15-20 minutes to finish it all in one go. "
25019,"Are you talking about the Sheikah Sensor? It will chime when you're near a shrine (and there's a little icon in the lower-right of the HUD that will light up). You can turn it on or off in the map screen, and eventually you'll get an upgrade that will allow it to detect things other than shrines."
