16104,"&gt; Where are all the Gerudo voe? Is this a lore thing I'm missing? It sounds like they exist, they're just ""not permitted in the city"".

We were discussing this on r/truezelda. We have concluded that a) the Gerudo still find boyfriends outside of their own race, judging by some light-skinned Gerudos, and b) Gerudo males are likely banished or killed after they mate.

From OoT, we know that the Gerudo often raid towns both for supplies and boyfriends, and they also imprison men, possibly their won boyfriends. We also see a mix of dark-skinned (""pure-blood"") and light-skinned (""mixed"") Gerudo in BotW, suggesting the above conclusions."
16152,"We're not sure if this is correct, given the lack of a male Gerudo in BotW. "
16427,"Do you have a source? I couldn't find anything on the wiki, and a quick search got no relevant results."
16654,"&gt; there's at least one Gerudo vai who takes on a Hylian mate in a sidequest!

Ooh, well there's another piece of evidence. Thanks for bringing this to my attention."
17813,"Imma pm /u/Austin_Drake, as Google Translate is shitty. But I wouldn't be surprised if it is whale, as the English translation of this game is rather spotty."
18615,"You're probably right. bad word choice on my part. It's possible they live longer lifespans than Hylians, but shorter than Zoras, but that seems unlikely given nobody seems to remember Urbosa like the Zoras remember Mipha."
21085,"&gt; Giant Whale Fossil is accurate. 巨大(kyodai) means 'giant/enourmous,' クジラ（鯨）(kujira) is the Japanese word for 'whale,' and 化石(kaseki) means 'fossil.' With の(no) being the attributive particle denoting that the fossils are that of a giant whale.

That's from my pal, and r/TrueZelda's unofficial translator, /u/austin_drake . Thanks for the information, man!"
21120,"Jeez, they really took a lot of liberties in the English translation. Thanks man, I appreciate it :)"
