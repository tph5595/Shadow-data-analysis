35273,Could someone give me a vague-ish hint as to where the last memory is (bottom right one in the album that looks like a forest)? I don't want to look it up because I've found them all without help except for this one...I've looked for hours and I'm getting so frustrated. Does anyone have a hint for me that isn't obvious but puts me on the right track?
39162,Okay I must be an idiot or something because I've checked every stable twice and can't find him :(
39863,"Ah thank you!! I had checked that stable but couldn't find him there (he didn't have his painting out because of the rain, I think) but now I can start heading for the last memory! Thanks for the point in the right direction!

Edit: found the memory :) can't believe it was that simple haha!"
