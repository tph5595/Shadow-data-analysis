13171,"Hey guys! I'm having a lot of trouble with the tower to the North West of Central Hyrule. It has a bunch of lightning Wizzrobes dancing around it that attack you all the way up, but since it's surrounded by water, it's nearly impossible to get into a position where you can actually fight them before ascending. Any thoughts? "
