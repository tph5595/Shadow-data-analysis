74634,"fun fact! The guy who sells you the vai clothes in kaza kaza bazaar might be a male Gerudo based on his appeareance - red hair, tan color, significantly taller, muscular I believe he even has amber eyes if I remember correctly (not even the female gerudos in this game have amber eyes anymore probably due to thousands of years of crossbreeding). Might also be a very convincing disguise, but at this point a) the only people capable of pulling that kind of disguise would be Sheikah or Yiga, and b) the implications of a male Gerudo desperately trying to blend in with his own kind are more interesting to think about."
