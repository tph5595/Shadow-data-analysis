6336,"The game has very few quantitative flaws (i.e. performance).  Most of the flaws typically stem from a subjective dislike of design choices.  The three flaws you listed are purely subjective and are hard to quantify.  

Nintendo made design choices that the felt would appeal to most people, but you can't please all the people all the time.  When you get a lot of different people with different tastes playing a game, it's totally expected that people won't agree on every design choice that was made and the fact that you feel like the game doesn't deserve a perfect score is entirely reasonable."
