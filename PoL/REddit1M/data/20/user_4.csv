2168,"I actually hated calamity Gannon's design. The name is very foreboding and what we got was something that barely resembles ganon and instead looks like a spider blob.

I also felt that the dark beast phase was so generic in terms of design. They could have at least decorated him with classic ganon things like braces on his arms and a huge crest on his head. Instead we got a solid purple pig with purple flames.

The fights themselves were nothing special either. Calamity just had a lot of health, and dark beast didn't even feel like it tried to attack you. 

I was so interested to find out more about calamity ganon and was left with little to no answers. Why is he this corrupted beast now? 

For me the whole fight lacked the epicness of traditional Zelda final battles and instead just felt very generic and unsatisfying. "
10065,I did. I don't remember anything specific. Why does he have to go into a cocoon to take a physical form? Nothing is ever explained and if it is its way to vague to be satisfying.
10743,No that was just for the dark beast segment. Instead of staying defeated and just reincarnating he used his remaining power to take the form of the dark beast.
10903,I don't think my expectations were unrealistic just a little small explanation would be fine. Previous games had those. I'm allowed to not enjoy a part of the game without being told I'm wrong or was expecting something unrealistic.
11460,It still doesn't explain the why though. Why does he have to go into a cocoon? Why is he corrupted?
