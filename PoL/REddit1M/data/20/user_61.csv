38871,"My take on Zelda not aging is that when she unlocked her powers (or at least from the moment she decided to fully use them to face Ganon) she temporarily ascended into some kind of immortal spirit form, or incarnation of Hylia. Notice how she can hear Fi talking (as Fi was a creation of Hylia herself) after unlocking her power in the final memory. I also noticed how she doesn't actually seem to have a physical body in the present until after she comes out once you've defeated dark beast Ganon, and even then she looks otherworldly until she seals him away.

Also, in the true ending, she talks about how she can no longer hear the voice in the sword. Presumably, having served her purpose, she's lost her goddess-like power and will continue aging normally from now on."
