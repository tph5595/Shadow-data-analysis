38939,I was afk in the first 2 hours right at the edge on the great plateu just when I got back to sit down I saw a meteroid falling from the sky and on inpact a yellow beam towards the sky appeared and stayed. I didnt had a paraglider yet... sooooo...
47249,"Imagine what could have been. A smaller world with 8 detailled and themed dungeons. Iron Boots and a breathing bubble, a hookshot, a longshot, more diverse enemies, better bosses, more Mini Bosses viarity, details. More Forests less cliffs, houses with people in them, a decent master sword quest.
The first few hours of this game just set a new standart in Zelda game, its just the truth the way a Zelda Game in an open world setting can be designed is fantastic. Just the feeling on its own and the magic of the wold could be enough.
Next time lets hope the world just 30% smaller with a lot more details."
47775,"You expect a perfect game when you start off the plateu, seeing the Castle, the Divine Beasts for the first time, the glowing dragon god thing, the corrupted one in the snowy mountains etc etc etc.

But the stretches of nothingness, the lack of motivating collectables, the lack of enemy viarity, the lack of real dungeons and bosses, the lack of miniboss viarity and the too big world just wore off on me. I no longer wanted to walk f√ºr hours.

The game is stellar in terms of world design, !game concept! and art design and truly a unique expierence that just havent existed like this before. It had its moments where you could actually see the vision the game creators had in mind and its a fantasy game looking for a competitor. and still it has too many flaws."
