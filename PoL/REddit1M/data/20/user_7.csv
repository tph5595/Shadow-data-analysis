2525,"So, after playing through and almost completing about 20% of the game, does anyone else feel this is about a 7.5-8 out of 10 game? It's great but I dont feel its anywhere 10/10 or even 9/10 at this point. There's a lot of flaws."
2548,Nope.
4329,"Off the top of my head:

Story is very lackluster.

Horse mechanics are bad.

The game starts to get repetitive after 25 hours"
7067,"So, if the story isnt lackluster, tell me about the other Champions. How did they become champions? What were their personalities outside of the very one dimensional aspects they showed (Mipha is caring, Revali cocky, etc.) How did they get in such good graces with Zelda? How did Link become chosen for the Master Sword? Was the Master Sword passed down? Did he have to go through a trial? If you want it broken down, the story is very lackluster because its no different than before. Honestly, it doesnt break away from some of the other elements. The plot from 100 years ago is great but, even then, the plot only extends to Zelda. No one else has deep character development. And, to be honest, the entire story is only 2, maybe 4 hours long max. That's a problem.

Most people have said horse mechanics are terrible, even with good temperament. Theyre very stiff and clunky.

Actually, the game does get repetitive. The gear acquisition/upgrade is pretty much useless after 2 stars, maybe 3. There's no boss or miniboss that really requires it beyond 2. Even the Silver Lynel is managable at 2. (Thats how I beat him is at only the 2nd upgrade)

The shrines start to get boring after about Shrine 60. Its all more of the same and they offer some minigames but stop being fulfilled.  Now, I say this in that I think its well balanced but you want more.  Same with boss hunting. Ill also add that the side quests are...theyre not as frequent as people think. I think the best way to put it is the side quests are busy work and the meat and bones of the game (Story, Plot, Shrines) serve a purpose but only when all together."
7314,"I would disagree on some aspects. I will relent that horse controls are subjective. However, the story and plot, which lasts from about 2-4 hours, and the repetitiveness of the open world, especially when you access more powerful weapons, gets repetitive and is a sticking point. Subjective flaws are weapon durability, stamina, and too much rain (which all of three of those I didnt have a problem with.)"
12832,"Yes, I did all the memories. For plot, it fleshes out the events of 100 years ago nicely...if youre only looking at Zelda. Problem is it focuses only on Zelda. There are a lot of unanswered questions that are not answered that should be.  It impacts the story a lot. 

I can easily name several other games where horse mechanics were handled way better: Red Dead Redemption, Shadow of the Colossus, and the Last of Us are starters. 

Really? You really havent found anything repetitive? From the example youve given, Lynels are all the same, roughly. They have six attacks: full out charge, charge with sword/lance, bow, fireball, and charged fire. Beating a normal one is no different than beating the Silver (I did beat him. First try in fact. Hes just a sword sponge.) And, thing is, theyre not hard to predict at all. "
12909,"Ive logged 60 hours actually. I dont dislike the game, dont think that. I quite enjoy it! I just think that its nowhere near a 10/10 perfect game, or heck even a 9/10. Its a refreshing Zelda game that needed more attention to the story and some other components."
13775,"Probably now that its been out for about two weeks, the hype is wearing off, especially for it being the first Zelda in 5 years, and there are some notable flaws that other games have done better, notably in this decade or the past 10 years. 

 It's probably too (my assumption) is that a lot of people are coming to the conclusion that its not a 10/10, one of the top 5 games ever made, etc and more like a 8 or 9 and that its a great game but not in the real of top 5."
14509,Im still doing a mixture of both. Im just focusing on shrine quests and normal ones. Ive enjoyed the shrine quests.
18745,"If i recall correctly, WW and the Fallen timeline does that several times."
22082,"Again, I would disagree with that. Several games have covered that.

Wind Waker - A backdrop but its a presence and its a lasting impact. Maybe not immediate apocalypse but its there.

Twilight Princess - Enough said there.

2nd Half of Ocarina of Time 

the original Legend of Zelda where its even referenced as the 'Tragedy of Zelda'

This is nothing new in Zelda."
22500,I cannot like this comment more than enough. I was trying to piece together something that the game does play it safe and your comment on lack of surprises is perfect. I think Im still in the 8/10 ballpark still but def in agreement!
23430,"Just to clarify:

We agree on Ocarina. 

Twilight Princess literally shows that they lost. They have a cutscene for it. The kingdom is engulfed in Twilight. Like, that screams it more than Breath of the Wild, in my opinion there, as Ganon is just refered to 'eh its there not here' versus TP.

For the original, in its original description its more about adventure. But at that time the entire story, and plot, was Ganon already won and that it was Zeldas last chance by splitting up the Triforce into 8 pieces.

Hence why Ive said its been done before and, in fact (even if you do not include Wind Waker) its very apparent and its very much a cornerstone. Ocarina of Time 2nd half we agree, Twilight Princess Zelda surrendered, Midna had no power, and Ganon had won. They did lose, and the original Zelda did lose. Hence why its been done before, storywise, and more urgent in at least two other games, ala Ocarina and TP."
