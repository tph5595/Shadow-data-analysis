68194,"This game is probably the best game I've ever played. It has many flaws, but it's strengths overwhelm them in my opinion.

**FLAWS**

The main story feels a bit disjointed with finding scattered memories and completing the Divine Beasts in any order, there was only ONE single villain in the game not named ""Ganon"" and it was Master Kohga, who was basically a puny version of Zant, and still had more personality than Ganon. I liked the idea of ""manipulating the dungeons"", but they were way too short and easy. I also felt like the story lacked a truly ""epic"" moment like the others in the franchise like: The catching of the Moon in MM, Zant seizing Hyrule in TP, The King flooding the castle in WW, becoming an adult in OOT, etc.  (If I had to pick one for BOTW, I would say pulling the Master Sword as your hearts plummeted down to almost nothing was pretty intense). I can't form a concrete opinion on the ending until the DLC, but it didn't feel very impactful, I liked the Silent Princess touch as the end frame though.

**STRENGTHS**

The world is massive and brimming with life and mystery. Exploring it is a blast, and hours will just melt away like minutes. I loved exploring the ocean and every island in WW and this game absolutely dwarfs it in every way. The side quests in this game have given me the feelings that I wanted to get out of the main story. Finding these amazing major landmarks that you somehow never noticed after 100+ hours always reminds you of how much you have yet discover in this world, no matter what that completion percentage says. The reward for completing all of Kass' ancient riddles was easily the best moment in this game for me, it brought tears to my eyes seeing a character develop in ways the main characters never quite do.

After putting in 120 hours, over 200 korok seeds, and only 8 shrines to go, my initial disappointment from the ending has long vanished. It's not about the destination. It's the journey.

**TL;DR - BREATH OF THE WILD IS THE METAL GEAR SOLID 5 OF THE FRANCHISE.**"
