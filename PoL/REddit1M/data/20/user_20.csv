9791,Yeah I think it's scaleless at the bottom. If you go to the Faron Jungles there's two waterfalls on opposite ends of each other. One with a shrine beneath it. If you want until night Farosh will spawn from that one. 
64906,"It's pretty abrupt. I mean, I shouldn't be *really* surprised that the game ends with ""confront Ganon, Zelda does light magic, boom"". But it could have served to be a bit longer and more involved. 

I think it probably suffered from having to be accessible *any* time in the game. The idea being, most players might attempt to confront Ganon early, get their ass whooped, and then go about the rest of the game. They obviously wouldn't want the player to experience the majority of end game content on an experience not designed to be seen by then. Plus it seems like the actual final moments are designed to go with a Link that does and doesn't know Zelda. "
66170,"I don't think they ever need to be an actual couple. For one... it raises some weird questions about their previous relationships. I mean, they're going with the idea that Princess Zelda is a descendant and Link is a reincarnation--which means if any Link hooked up with any Zelda, then any future incarnation of Link is hooking up with his own descendant. Sure, no blood relation... but still kind of weird.

Personally I think they should just have it that she's a reincarnation as well. They've only gotten more and more on board with the idea that Link and Zelda share a sort of transcendent, not inherently romantic, bond, but that doesn't really follow if Zelda is a different person each time. "
66522,"So how exactly does the Hyrule lineage work at the moment? They very carefully go about not naming Zelda's mother or grandmother, each of whom apparently has the blood tie to the Goddess. Meaning they, too, are Zeldas. 

However, that would imply the King married into it, and that's obviously the only sensible explanation (besides some weird af Egyptian shenanigans), but they kind of present it like he's the blood heir. He has the big long king name, apparently is going to continue ruling the kingdom even past Zelda's coming of age, has places in Hyrule named after him, and just generally comes across as the True King of Hyrule vibe.

It's not that that stuff is *without* explanation (maybe he has a personal name and a royal name, consorts get stuff named after them too, who says consorts can't be kingly), it's just that it seems the writers were simultaneously trying to portray him as the blood ruler of Hyrule and kind of forgot how that would have worked with her mother. 

Although I guess for all we know Zelda's mother wasn't actually a Zelda, but maybe a sage or holy maiden. 

EDIT: Actually, it occurs to me that the King even says *he* named her in convention with royal tradition. Not he and his wife. "
