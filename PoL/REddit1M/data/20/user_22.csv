10945,"I understand some of people's disappointments, but I'm honestly pretty surprised by the complete 180 of this sub's general narrative lately. I know there's plenty of people who still love the game, but it seems like a lot more people dislike or are constantly nitpicking the game. 

I can totally own up the fact that this game isn't flawless, some things could've been done better, but damn this has been the best single player gaming experience in my 25 years. Sure, there's some dull moments here or there, but overall, every single time I turn on this game I don't know what I'm going to expect, and I'm still surprised and excited by what I experience every day."
