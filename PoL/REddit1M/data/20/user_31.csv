16841,"Climbing up walls in the rain is easier once you know that you slide every six ""steps."" So you can take advantage of that by taking five steps and then jumping. It's not great but it's usually enough to get you up to the next cliff where you can hopefully start a fire and wait it out or something.

And also, just because I didn't know until 50 hours in that there's a weather forecast on the bottom right of the screen. It helps you decide if you should start to climb a wall or if you should wait it out or whatever.

That blood moon thing is BS tho lol."
