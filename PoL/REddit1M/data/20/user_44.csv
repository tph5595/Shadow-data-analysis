23054,"Good point. I think the 98 Metacritic score and seeing all those perfect 10/10s caught people off guard. They truly expected to play a perfect game, which is impossible. I really hope at the end of the day when time passes they do consider this a top 2 zelda game. Personally, this is the greatest and more rewarding gaming experience I've had. Every game is never perfect, and BotW definitely has flaws, but Nintendo made an incredibly ambitious move that abandoned many Zelda traditions we fans came to expect, and they pulled it off with a grand slam. People are complaining because it departs from the familiar. We have a greater tendency to nitpick and criticize when an entire new set of standards replaces the ones that we've been so used to for 30 years. Link to the Past was the first video game memory I had. I have incredibly vivid memories of exploring the dark world. BotW somehow recreated those same feelings. I really hope zelda fans that are disappointed with the game eventually realize the importance of the botw's context in gaming and appreciate it at some point. sorry for being repetitive. I've put in over 100 hours and can't put down my controller. "
