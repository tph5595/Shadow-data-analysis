876,"I actually felt very overwhelmed by the entire end of the game. It felt like they were building up for something great and then it just kinda fell flat. It was a decent boss fight (the second phase was at least a little epic, of not very difficult), and a decent ending but it left so much unanswered. And the thing I hated most of all was that it stuck with the zelda tradition of starting you off right before the final boss fight when you reboot the game after finishing it. I want to explore the world I've saved, but you never get to in Zelda games "
1382,"Mentioned this in a child comment already, but I'm curious if it bothers anyone else that the game always boots from your last save prior to the final boss in Zelda games. In other modern RPGs that are very similar to this game, such as Fallout, once the story is done you get to them explore the world that you've saved, which I always view as the best reward to finishing the story. But I'm Zelda games it always just feels like this endless loop that you can't escape. I know it's sort of petty, but I'm just curious what everyone else thinks about it "
3061,"Yeah that would definitely be a huge hurdle. I think that the game itself would have to be built with this concept in mind. Another problem I forgot to mention is that if a person wanted to 100% the game before the final confrontation, they wouldn't have nearly as much freedom. There are definitely issues with it, but I think the main reason I wanted it was because (spoiler alert here because you said you haven't reached the end and because I don't know how to use a spoiler tag) I was so disappointed with the end of the game. Had the story concluded in a satisfying way, I would have been perfectly pleased with the way the end game worked. But since it was pretty underwhelming, I don't think it was really all that great to sacrifice this for the story "
11705,I know but this game rejected so many of the regular zelda conventions that I didn't think that just that being the way of the games of the past would have to determine this one 
20868,"I wouldn't say I hate the dungeons, but it definitely left me craving some of the old ones. When I first started the game I was scared that it would do everything so well that it would make me feel like I had no reason to go back and play other zelda games, but the dungeons proved to me that this isn't the case "
87717,"I think you're definitely correct. Still, I wish there had been a way for them to reward the players who did go out of our way to find all the memories, get all the divine beasts, etc. I've only beaten the game once and I haven't read much about the game's ending, so maybe this is true, but if it is I think that even what I can assume would be the best ending is still not very great "
