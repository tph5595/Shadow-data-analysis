18666,"Here's the biggest problem I have with the game that hasn't been mentioned: variety. All of the variety in this game comes from the open world environment. This isn't really the bad part, because there's so much stuff to discover in the world and exploration is very enjoyable in this game. 

The problem is that all the shrines, dungeons, and dungeon bosses all have very little aesthetic variety. To me, shrines felt like a chore past #10 because they were all so similar looking, even though a lot of the individual puzzles are pretty fun. Keep in mind that there are 120 of them, and you'll probably do at least 30 if you're beelining main quest only. Also all the dungeons have you do the exact same objectives using the same gimmick (which is pretty cool the first time) and fight nearly the same boss.

Would've liked some more normal enemy and miniboss variety too, especially more types of guardians, but that wasn't as big of a deal.  

Edit: As the parent comment says, this is what made it 8/10 instead of 10/10 for me. If you want a very well thought out review, check out Jim Sterling's review. I didn't mind a lot of the problems he points out, but his 7/10 is very fair imo."
