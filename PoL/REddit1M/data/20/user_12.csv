5321,"It is very annoying how you literally cannot scale any surface in the rain. I wouldn't mind so much if climbing used more stamina in the wet, but to climb a few paces and drop down by a similar distance every few seconds is just too much. It means if you're halfway through scaling a tough mountain and it starts raining you either wait for 15 mins or give up and warp away.

Also, it's bullshit that the blood moon ""resets"" the environment. I was sneaking up on a good horse and about to mount it, suddenly the blood moon cutscene interrupted. When the game loaded up again, not only was the horse I was about to mount gone, but completely different horses had been spawned instead.

Otherwise, I love this game.  "
