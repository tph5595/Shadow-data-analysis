83479,"Does anyone know what is the actual maximun storage capacity for armors? like maybe it was datamined or someone bought a shit ton of the cheapest clothers in order to find out..

I already have all of what's available (and it fits) but, since I still have a ton of clothes to upgrade and Koroks to find I was wondering if it would be possible to collect each armor for each posible color xD I won't get them all but I'd like to know where the limit is in order to choose which ones I go for"
