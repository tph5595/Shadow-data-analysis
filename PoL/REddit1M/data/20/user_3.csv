2009,One of the coolest moments in any video game I've ever played: when the Divine Beasts let loose and fire on Calamity Ganon. My jaw was dropped the entire time. 
5457,But can we talk about how when the floor breaks in the cathedral and Link and Ganon are plummeting it's like when Gandalf and the Balrog fell in a fight to the death?!?!?!?
