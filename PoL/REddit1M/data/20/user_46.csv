25345,"Ok.. I have a question. 

During my journey I have seen 3 pillars of light. Red, Green[Yellow] and Blue at different locations [These are not Sheikah Markers from the Slate]

Red is somewhere close or nearby the Gerudo Tower.

Yellow I think was somewhere near the location you first see Farosh

Blue is somewhere in the red-colored mountains [Gerudo Highlands?] 

I haven't had luck in chasing these down... As when I use the scope when I am somewhat near them, they do not show up.

What do these 3 lights signify ? are they just Shrines or is it something more?"
28476,I will need to double check. I can see the Yellow and Red consistently but not the blue. I'll have to post the pictures to Twitter and post them here.
34628,I certainly can!
