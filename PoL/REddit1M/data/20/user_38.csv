All in all, really good game, but not in my pantheon of Zeldas. I give it a 7. Absolutely beautiful, well-connected world and fun core mechanics, just a little too much that felt tedious and/or same-y to me that held it back. I can definitely understand people who enjoy open-world games more than me viewing this one as a masterpiece."
