2524,"In some ways, I'm bothered by the idea. On the other hand, I can see the justification; having to make post-boss-fight conditions for every NPC to interact with could be time consuming for something that a portion of your player base would see.

For Breath of the Wild, though, I think it makes sense. So far as I can tell, Calamity Ganon is the source of *everything* going on right now. Hell, the monsters all look like they're made from Calamity Ganon, to an extent. If he's gone (I haven't seen the end, so not sure if he's actually gone or not), then what enemies are left? What's controlling Divine Beasts you haven't cleared yet? Are Guardians just shut down? etc."
3369,"&gt; It's great but I dont feel its anywhere 10/10 or even 9/10 at this point.

Honestly, I feel like rating systems are a little weird, anyway. If you wanted me to give Breath of the Wild a rating, it would be 9 or 10/10. Not because it's perfect, but because I'm not certain I could enjoy playing Breath of the Wild more than I am right now.

Rating based on how much one *enjoyed* playing the game, rather than trying to identify what's ""perfect"" makes more sense."
18390,"&gt; the story is very lackluster because its no different than before

Perhaps if you're breaking it down to brass tacks. ""Link defeats Ganon, yay.""

But I mean, this game literally opens with ""We lost. Behold what's left of Hyrule."" No other Zelda game has dared touch that."
19353,"Not in the same way, though. The atmosphere of the game is dramatically different because they established that very early on. Wind Waker, as an example, is a much brighter atmosphere (and I don't mean graphics) with some sense of ""something bad happened a really long time ago"" but no one remembers it 'cause no one alive today was alive back then. It's somewhat a thing, but I don't feel like it plays so heavily into the story since Zelda and Link both end up discovering themselves over the course of the journey. It's truly relevant during the final fight.

Now compare to how Breath of the Wild has been handling this. From the get go, you're presented with the immediate threat and destruction of the world. Calamity Ganon is something you can always see just off in the distance, choking Hyrule Castle. One of the first locations of note you pass is the destroyed Temple of Time, and the environmental storytelling further emphasizes the loss. The sheer number of destroyed Guardians, their poses trying to break through the temple. It all speaks to that war.

Then, a huge number of NPCs address the Calamity directly. A lot of them were there to see it and remember it. A number of them watched you basically die, or hauled your mauled corpse to the shrine. And there are these giant, rampaging mechanical beasts in the four corners of the world threatening to destroy everything around them, who were previously (revered as) gods of protection.

The entire landscape of Breath of the Wild is pock-mocked and scarred. Ruins are more abundant than actual functional cities or towns. You can't go anywhere without being reminded of the loss. Wind Waker, it's a backstory."
23075,"I'll openly admit I'm probably just arguing semantics at this point, and you're right in the overall that the overall theme has been seen before, but I think it's in the details that makes the story for Breath of the Wild so different than any other. As such:

&gt; 2nd Half of Ocarina of Time

Fair point here.

&gt; Twilight Princess - Enough said there.

I don't feel like this is ""We lost; behold what's left of Hyrule"" more than ""We're losing, and are going to lose if you don't do something.""

&gt; the original Legend of Zelda 

I actually had no idea what the original's storyline was outside of the really brief synopsis, but reading it over I can see where you're coming from. But it still doesn't feel pervasive, like it's the major overarching theme like in Breath of the Wild.

I guess that's what I'm really trying to say. You're right that the theme has been visited before, but it hasn't been such a cornerstone and immediately apparent at every turn as it is in Breath of the Wild, though Hyrule for Adult Link is close."
23630,Fair points all around. I might need to go back and play those over again; I'd forgotten Hyrule Castle had already been consumed by Twilight early in the game.
