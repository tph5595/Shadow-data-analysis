15944,"Gannon's dark magic is very poorly understood. Normally he comes back in a physical form already. For some reason, he chose to come back in the form of a spirit made of energy instead of a physical beast this time. Maybe it was to avoid setting off the guardians? Who knows. But he didn't come back with a physical body at first. That's a big difference from previous games. 

His spirit corrupted the guardians and divine beasts, taking control of them. After that, he started focusing on summoning monsters and building a body for himself. That process involved a cocoon and a whole lot of time and effort. It's not something he can do quickly or easily. 

He's never used a cocoon before, but he's also never tried to make a body like this. His Calamity form has tons of legs and he appeared to be trying to merge with the ancient Sheikah technology of the guardians and the divine beasts to become more powerful. 

The various Blight Ganons seem to be prototypes for his new body - creatures made of his malice and Sheikah technology fused together. He built them before he built his own buggy body. 

Bug mode was a weird experiment that Zelda interrupted using her sealing/stasis magic. He was never able to finish it due to Zelda's magic, and you basically tear him out of his cocoon while he's still a malformed and incomplete larval shell. 

After you defeat him in his incomplete bug body, he's able to transform into a pig monster very quickly, like in previous games. So clearly pig-mode is much simpler and easier for him than bug-mode. It's his natural transformation, while the Calamity/bug form was not. 

We have no idea *exactly* what bug mode is or what it would have looked like if he'd been able to complete it because he's literally never done anything like this before. We know he was trying to build a stronger body that used ancient Sheikah tech, and that the cocoon was part of that process, but that's all the info we can ever get. We kinda killed him before we could ask any questions.
