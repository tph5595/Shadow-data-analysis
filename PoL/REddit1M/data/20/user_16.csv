11569,Zelda has always been like that though. 
11812,"I totally agree. I could list a few things that bug me, but otherwise this game is brilliant. Last night I spent a few hours clearing shrines. Then I went to Lynel hunting. It was fun start to finish. "
11996,"Huh? Have you done the memories? The memories flesh out the story and it is actually really solid.

I love the horse mechanics. I haven't ever seen a game with a similar style. Catching and breaking horses is very well done.

I've logged close to 100 hours, I think, and haven't found a repetitive thing yet. Each shrine is different. Last night I was Lynel hunting and was amazed how different each one fought me. I then took a run through the castle and just had a blast killing guardians. 

This game has its flaws, but it is so wonderfully done I'd give it a 10 out of 10 any day. "
12561,"If you're at shrine 60 and have beaten the game, you have to be past 25 hours. You mean to tell me you dislike a game that much but have logged 25+ hours on it?"
14215,"With the story, I think a big part is it is The Legend of Zelda. The story is about ZELDA. I agree some things could be flushed out, but I like the story of Zelda. 

I honestly haven't played a lot of those games. I played a bit of Red Dead but it just felt like GTA in the west and I didn't love it- I know blasphemy. 

I found a Lynel last night that did a weird over the head move I hadn't seen. I also think what weapon you use drastically changes things up. I also really enjoy the fighting mechanics. 

Are you doing the Shrine Quests now? I sort of ran out of the random shrines and am focused on those. Some are pretty unique. "
