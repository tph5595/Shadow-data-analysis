They still could have made that work for the Zora area by having the Devine Beast only accessible from atop an area where you need to climb up to, and kept it raining nonstop until you beat it. 

I think they missed a huge opportunity here. I don't know how they design team didn't think of this. Or if they did, who the hell decided it was a good idea to not implement it?"

I miss the old dungeons of battling for keys to open doors into the next room to progress through the dungeon. The lack of enemies in the dungeons, and even in the hallways in the castle was disappointing. 

And the champions are weak af if they lost to the bosses inside the Devine beasts. All 4 of them were a joke.  "
