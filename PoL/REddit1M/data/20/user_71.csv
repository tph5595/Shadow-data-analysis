48858,"Can someone help me? I'm with the Goron dude trying to scale the mountain to get the divine beast. I guess I took too long and my 3 fire elixirs + the armor I got for those lizards are not lasting me all the way up. It won't let me fast travel out of the mountain. And I don't have enough time left to go back.

What do I do? Am I fucked here ?"
