22010,"Just finished the game.

For starters, I dont feel its right to complain about a game after playing it for 80 hours, and only beggining to feel bored in the last 10.  I want to judge it based on the first 70, and those were amazing.

I do think, however, the game could have ran better, especially in towns, and could have had more enemy types.  The enemies in this game are actually extremely easy, because for the most part, you never need to fight them.  20 hours in, I began just running away.  Furthermore, the game encourages you not to fight in many cases, because fighting requires resources, and you almost never break even or profit from fighting enemies.  I think this could be fixed in hard mode though, if they made the enemies more agressive, and gave them more ranged attacks.

Exploration in this game is perfect, no doubt. Rain is annoying, but thats a nitpick.  

The dungeons are cool, but are much too short, and lack almost any combat.  They either needed more of them, or needed to make them longer.  Same with shrines.  While there are many shrines, the shrines are much too short and repetitive in most cases.  It would be cool to have some 30 minute long shrines.  Once again, I consider this a minor gripe, and while I think a sequel would do well to remedy these issues, I dont think it was detrimental to the game.

My absolute biggest gripe with the game, is its lack of surprises.  It is weird because the game, in a sense has more surprises than any other game. Sailing to eventide island, finding a shrine in the middle of nowhere, climbing lynyaru.  There always seems to be surprises around every corner.  

But only the other hand, the game completely lacks surprises.  Within the first 2 hours of the game you know exactly what you need to do to beat ganon.  Get the sword, get the beasts.  The game never changes that, or throws a turn at you.  OoT, youre told you need to get the sword, then WTF I went forward in time!  Wind Waker, you need to get three sprit orbs, then WTF Hyrule is frozen in time, and I need to repower the sword and get the triforce to beat ganon?!  Twilight Princess, you need midnas twilight armour, then wtf, Zant took it, and broke the twilight mirror, and Ganon took over Hyrule!?!  Breath of the wild does nothing like this.  

Furthermore, every time you see a shrine or do a quest you know exactly what the reward will be.  A spirit orb for shrines and shrine quests, and rupees or food for side quests.  The game never changes that up.  The hylian shield is just chilling in the castle, there are no special items to get from quests, and the master sword literally just requires you to have hearts.  In other zelda games, it was always exciting to find out what you were getting to finish a huge, maybe annoying quest.  But now, I see (Shrine Quest) pop on the screen, and I know exactly what I am getting.  

Thays my biggest gripe with the game. A small thing past Zelda games did so well, but was unfortunately sacrificed in this game.  My issue is that it didnt need to be.  Why not have a quest for the hylian shield.  Why not have a quest for epona? Why not have a quest to repower the master sword?  Why not have a plot twist after you rescue the divine beasts? Doing this would have done nothing to the other aspects of the game they were going for, and would have given them a chance to actually use the entire map.  Snowpeak is completely unused in this game, Faron and Lake Hylia, are regretably forgetable and shunned, the Temple of Time is useless etc.

My only other gripe is that the boss fights, for a Zelda game, are nothing short of underwhelming.  For how ""challenging"" people claim this game is, all the boss fights, including Ganon, are ridiculous pushovers.  I didnt get hit once in the final stage of Ganon on my first try!  I beat Ganon first try, without any cooked food on me!  The design of the bosses are pretty bad as well. They dont require you to solve any puzzle to beat them.  Shoot some arrows, wait for them to fall, beat them with the master sword, rinse repeat.  

The game is at least a 9/10 for me, for the world design and perfect exploration.  However, I do feel that they could have made things even better.  Im hoping for a sequel!
