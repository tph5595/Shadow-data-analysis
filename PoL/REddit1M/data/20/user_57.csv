34327,"I wonder why the game doesn't have that many enemies.

You mostly fight Bokoblins, Moblins and Keese the whole game.

Whatever happened to Like Likes? For once you had plenty of reasons to lose your shield.

Leevers? There's a big desert out here.

Ropes? I guess lack of proper dungeon.

Pols Voices? No flute I guess.

Goriyas? There are boomerangs in the game so I don't see why not.

Tektites?

Not even Stalfos? I guess there are reanimated enemies but whatever.

Most of these were already done in other 3D games."
