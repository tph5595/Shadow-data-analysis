30572,The yiga clan infiltration for the gerudo part is gamebreaking bad. The worst stealth gameplay I've ever experienced in any video game.
48719,"I got stuck for multiple days, probably nearly 10 hours. I was determined not to use a guide but eventually gave in.

Funny enough I made it into the room I was supposed to go to but I didn't know there was a metal door that needed magnesis. Since it had a treasure chest in the room, I assumed it was just a random treasure room.

My complaints on this section are:

-poor layout (hard to see, enemies too close together, short barriers to hide behind)
-unforgiving (one detect and you get slaughtered)
-unreliable detection (sometimes bananas are ignored or the wrong enemy goes to it causing even more trouble)
-poor room design (the room with the treasure chest looks like a simple treasure room. why hide the door too)

I went into this thinking I needed a key to free a prisoner. Not thinking I needed to find a hidden door to fight a boss.

Another complaint is the massive trigger fight for getting caught is so absurd and unnecessary. Just blow a whistle and make me reappear outside. Why even give me a choice to fight that losing battle? If you're strong enough, great! If not, you either run outside (wasting time) or your have to reload your game (wasting time).

The only positive was the master kohga boss fight is a classic Zelda boss fight and much better than the blight ganon boss battles."
