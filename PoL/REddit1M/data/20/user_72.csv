50524,"Things I love about BOTW:

1. The exploration. Seriously, this game is huge. I'm already 20 hours in and I'm already at Vah Ruta's dungeon boss. Probably take me 100+ hours to beat the game total

2. I love the replayability. 900 Korok seeds, 72 side quests, 120 shrines, oh my!

3. The little details, like the weather and temperature changes, or how each person in each village has a specific schedule. 

Now, for the things I don't like about BOTW.

1. I don't like the dungeons because they don't have specific themes. The dungeons in Ocarina of Time wer egreat because each one was around a certain theme (Water, Fire, Shadow, etc.)

2. The problem with the resources breaking is that I'm at the Water Blight Ganon and (I think) I need a bow to beat it. However, the bow I have keeps breaking, and I only have one bow in my inventory, and I have no idea where to get more bows. 

3. I really like the idea of shrines, but they really needed to be longer with more puzzles. I found that most of them were way too easy. 

4. Is there a trading quest in the game? Haven't encountered one yet. 

5. I just don't want all of the bosses and dungeons to be copies of each other. 

Don't get me wrong, BOTW is still an amazing game. Its totally worth the $60 I paid for it, and its the best Zelda game by far. "
