22505,"I feel disappointed not just from some small aspects of the game or its ending but rather the game as a whole.

Sure it was great during the first few days before I beat it but then I couldn't help thinking like I'd been fooled by the trailers. It was very disappointing to find out that every single cool moment from the trailers was just a cutscenes of something that happened before the game. The whole broken master sword was barely a plot point yet they made it out to be huge with the statue and all.

It's just sad thinking about what could've been if they didn't decide to do a 100 year time skip thing and just have us play through the game with the start being before Link goes into stasis to heal. It would've been cool to at least have a metroid style intro where we begin with some gear towards the end of the initial plot and then start the game.

I mostly just wish the game were longer and more difficult because I blazed through it even when I tried to go slowly. Although it shouldn't be this way let's hope that the dlc fixes it with the hard mode and extra story."

48227,Did it make you unable to progress somehow? Get stuck and no way in/out? What happened??
