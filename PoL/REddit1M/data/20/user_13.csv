5928,"I had just finished clearing out a very brutal camp with silver enemies, so I sat down at their campfire to bring morning and lo and behold the blood moon happened. After the cutscene I resume in the middle of like 6 silver Lizalfos. Link put on his running boots and ran the hell away to regroup."
6240,"&gt; Story is very lackluster.

The story is probably the best out of any Zelda game. It actually gives Zelda and the rest of the world personalities rather than being dull NPC's who you just need to save.

&gt; Horse mechanics are bad.

Why? I've seen no problem with them. Get a horse with a good temperament and you won't have any issues. They even auto-pilot if you get them on roads.

&gt; The game starts to get repetitive after 25 hours

Couldn't disagree more. 60 hours in, finished the game, now 88 shrines in and I still look forward to playing it every day. Right now I'm boss hunting. Got 32 shrines left to find. Lots of side quests left to do. Plus there's always the gear acquisition/upgrade system which is fun to do."
