18032,My thoughts exactly. Skyward Sword was a great game but I'm more of a fan of the more realistic Zelda's.
18103,I actually really liked the way Link looked in SS. It would be cool to see that Link with TP textures.
18297,"That sucks. What the hell is the point of making the Wii-U more powerful then? Zelda is the only game I would go out of my way to buy the Wii-U for and it won't be in HD...

Nintendo has been making a lot of questionable decisions in the last few years..."
18448,You didn't like Skyward Sword?
18545,"The stupid fucking dancing in the fountains was the one part I hated.

Soooooooooooo dumb. I was worried someone would walk in and see her doing that haha..."
18608,I'm not even entirely sure what you're talking about so I must not have been that annoyed by it.
18824,"I like remakes. As long as it doesn't interfere with the current Zelda being made, I don't see why they shouldn't."
18852,How about both?
18972,That's contrary to something someone said in another comment... I'm so conflicted now...
20029,"But that's the thing. I am saying I very much prefer the gritty, life-like art-style. SS looked great. Very artistic. But I would have rather had it be like TP."
20304,"No, not always. Speaking of hardware, the modern controller is basically made up of controls that they made first. Thumbsticks, shoulder buttons, the D-PAD, the 4 main buttons on the right hand side. All controller features that Nintendo did first.

You do have a point. Just saying, they have been very innovative with hardware too in the past.

Anyway... I do think it's a mistake. And while Windwaker may be a great game *despite* it's art style and graphics, I truly would have liked it more if it were more like OOT/TP."
20382,Ok so you're saying that they will probably make it HD but with the same water-colory art style?
21720,"Trust me, I am pretty hardcore when I play Zelda games. Definitely pulled a lot of all-nighters."
21916,"You're missing the point O_O

I *don't like* the painted look of SS as much! I really couldn't care less if it's HD or not. As I see it, it really wouldn't be utilizing the HD very well imo if they did a style similar to SS.

I see what you're saying. But either way it's a huge bummer for me."
22465,"Your English is fine. I wouldn't have even noticed if you didn't say anything so don't worry.

Well... I guess to each their own. I thought the Boss Battles were great. There were lots of good puzzles. Good animations and while I didn't like the art style *that* much, I did like the character design of the humans(but I totally agree that some of the other races were stupid looking).

Also, the controls for me were great. Felt almost 1 to 1 movent. I know some people had trouble with it but I suspect those were people who aren't particularly used to the Wii controller in general.

My biggest issue was that minor enemies looked ridiculous. And even a few of the bosses were stupid looking(although I thought the final boss was BADASS).

Definitely wouldn't say it's the worst Zelda. I think it's among the best."
60829,Yeah and obviously I was wrong. But that way never my main worry to begin with.
62357,"Because I'm not anymore! Ffs, why are people not understanding that? I acknowledged that I was wrong about it not being HD. Do I need to make an edit in each related comment just to ward off people wanting to argue with me about something I already know I was wrong about?

Reddit is far too similar to politics...

But either way, I am bummed out about the new game being done in SS style. I don't like the painted look. I would rather have the TP sort of style."
71593,"No shit? When did I say otherwise? I only ever said how *I* feel about it.

If you took words like, ""I like,"" and, ""I prefer,"" as factual, objective statements, that's your problem."
81124,I recall you being the one that kept asking me questions about it.
