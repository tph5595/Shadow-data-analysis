4047,I'd like to see the other way around.

Maybe not as bright as Skyward Sword, but that's because Twilight Princess went for a more realistic style. And the reality isn't that colorful.

Colors = Good, is complete bullshit. It's not about the colours, it's about the atmosphere. If the game is dark, then use dark colours. If the game is happy then use happy colors. So there is Limbo which is almost completely black, and there is Kitty's Rainbow Island which is a happy game so use happy colors."

64946,You made this? Cool. I can't wait to see the result.
