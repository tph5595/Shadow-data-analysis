19642,You can still make the game look better while still having a simplistic art style. Just look at Journey on the PS3.
19756,"What about the water temple's underworld theme? What about the last boss? But I agree, there was a missed opportunity with the ghost ship boss. I think they ended up running out of time, because that boss was way too simplistic in terms of gameplay and style."
19870,"Every Zelda game has its own annoyances. I can't stand the sailing in WW. Sure the exploration is fun, but it gets boring and tedious when I just want to get from point A to point B, and some of the exploration wasn't even that interesting."
20126,"But you were saying it wouldn't be in HD and the power of the Wii-U would go to waste because it had the SS art style, and that's definitely not true (especially the HD part)."
21671,"Well it would almost have to be HD, HD is defined by the output resolution of the game. Wind Waker can be played in HD if you emulate it.

Furthermore if it's water-colory that doesn't mean you can't have better lighting, effect, and anti-aliasing."
