14594,"Even if I hated SS, I must admit you are wrong. TP graphics were amazing, yet not as good as SS. It's the childish colors that killed it, I think.

(And the rest of the damn game except very few things)

14788,"I mean, I don't really like SS colors but I think it would make it perfect if the Twilight was even darker that in TP. This way, the contrast would be what makes it a great mod."

Way too easy even in hero mode. Bosses were disappointing to fight (also in their look, except the Zen temple boss), temples were short but enjoyable. Though, I loved the Zen temple (now one of my favorite Zelda temples) and the boat, but the boss of the boat temple was so horrible it ruined it.

The items were ok, except for the wind jar and the flying insect. Upgrading them was really fun. The problem here was upgrading potions. Maybe it's just me but I never use potions in Zelda, so upgrading them with insects was useless. Probably not such a problem since I know some people like to play Zelda more as a RPG. At least I could sell these insects.

What I hated though was the over use of the motion plus. Maybe I just suck at hitting at the right place but to be honest, as a lover of retro games, I prefer hitting the right button rather than hitting with the right motion.

Storyline was pretty good, Zelda's model was original.

I didn't really like the world. A separated land didn't do it for me. Voyaging in the sky was extremely slow. Not much to explore, all the side quests are in the same place, and all of them that requires you to go down are just about finding a missing item with your detection power.

But what I hated the most was the childish look. Just take a look at the races. I mean, ok leaf-dudes weren't so bad, but take a fucking look at the mogmas (french name, not sure about the english one : I'm talking about the moles) and robots. Looks like they were designed for six years old. I guess it was the case. What's wrong with old Zoras and regular Gorons ?

I'm not talking about colors here. The style of WW seemed a lot more juvenile, but at least the races weren't so horrible.

But wait. I think it's the worst Zelda, that is just my opinion. ""Worst Zelda"" : that means it's still an awesome game. I can't say I didn't enjoy, I just enjoyed it a lot less than, for instance, its predecessor, Twilight Princess.

PS: I don't English too good, sorry.

21280,You probably don't understand if you played it 30 hours straight without ever reloading a save. That's the way to play Zelda.
