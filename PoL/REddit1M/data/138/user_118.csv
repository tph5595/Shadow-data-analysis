No it's not. It's impossible for an opinion to be fact. Also, Zelda II was fucking brilliant and in my eyes better than Zelda I. The only thing you can prove about Zelda II was that it was the hardest Zelda, but it was also very balanced and fair. Free-roaming enough to give a sense of exploration, but structured enough to to prevent you from mindlessly, aimlessly destroying the scenery in hopes of finding a dungeon or something. "
