4810,Again further proving the point the TP was better than SS.
13580,"it absolutely proves that they took the complete wrong step in the graphical department. Just when LoZ started to get real gritty and mature, started to really evolve... they slap us with the kid shit again. As for the downvotes, thats fine. I would downvote that status too if it were the other way around. But I would like to see someone put TP graphics on SS and watch what happens."
13634,Agreed... SS makes me not want to get the HD remake of WW when its released until they release a proper Zelda game.
