30573,Their profits on their Wii and handhelds would say that your beginning argument is moot.
51932,"I should've been more specific and less vague. Bad is a relative term and what is bad for you and me is not necessarily bad for a company. The Wii may have been a bad decision in terms of pushing graphics technologies, but it was an excellent decision on Nintendo's part in terms of profit and pushing ""gimmicky"" technologies like motion-sensitive controllers. 

So in summary: Nintendo in my opinion made a fantastic hardware decision when it came to the Wii. They opted for cheap, lower quality hardware in exchange for cheaper prices. They predicted that the lower console price + the new control scheme would help them reach a larger crowd and thus profit massively since Sony and Microsoft wasn't going after that niche.

And yes, Zelda is amazing."
