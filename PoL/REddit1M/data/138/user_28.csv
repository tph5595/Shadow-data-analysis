11449,"The [rumor](http://wiiudaily.com/2012/09/wii-u-zelda-game-coming-2014/) is that a really awesome new one is coming out next year. Supposedly the temples will be the size of OOT's Hyrule field, and the gamemakers were really involved with the development of the Wii U gamepad, so it's supposed to utilize all of the pad's features really well. Fingers crossed!"

18081,That makes me sad :( I've been holding out to get the Wii U until that game comes out. Now I have no motivation to ever get one.
56729,Agreed! I'm so ready for the next game! I won't buy the Wii U until it does.
