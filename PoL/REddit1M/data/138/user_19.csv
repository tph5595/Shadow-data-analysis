9924,"This just shows how much I dislike SS's texture style. Great game, I just prefer either the gritty(TP) or cel-shaded(WW). Never liked the in between style. "

35175,The blurriness is what made me hate it. The style? Fantastic.  It looks great when people buff it up in Dolphin. The actual game looks like crap because the wii can't handle it. I enjoyed it regardless of how it looked though.
