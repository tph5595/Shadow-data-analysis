52016,"What you said about the WiiU is exactly what I was thinking. It makes perfect sense that we would have a TP style Zelda for the WiiU because it has been probably the most realistic style, almost like a gritty, Hollywood action movie (except Nintendo).

I think all of the right elements are there already; the WiiU will be able to process much larger worlds, larger dungeons all with innovative twists on control schemes as we've come to expect with each new Zelda game.

The obvious use of the gamepad would be for inventory, map and touch / drawing related puzzles, similar to the 3DS Zelda games, but with a TP sequel we could also expect a sensory view of the world, such as the skill you had with Wolf-Link, except you wouldn't have to phase in and out of this view; it would be available on the gamepad all the time.

There's plenty they could do with the plot, too. We could cross over into the Twilight completely to team up with Midna to face some new threat. Perhaps Princess Zelda could be included in some way too, linking the two worlds further.

Or maybe there could be another alternate world, opposite to the Twilight (Dawn World or something?) and Link would travel between the two. He could have an alternate beast form to change into.

I know Twilight Princess wasn't the most successful of Zelda games, but let's face it, Nintendo can do whatever they want and it'll sell because it's Nintendo. Everything they touch is gold, and the WiiU has opened up a world of possibilities for them. As long as Legend of Zelda continues to be Legend of Zelda they can't do wrong."
