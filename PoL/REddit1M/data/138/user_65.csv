However, food for thought, I will point out that while there is a distinction in the model style, the two games are built off the same engine. I didn't realize it until I ran SS Link through a zone exit with his sword out, the idle run animation is exactly the same as Twilight Princess Links. It's hard to spot since Link will always run with his sword outstretched, which annoyed the hell out of me btw. It goes to show how vital art direction is to game design.
