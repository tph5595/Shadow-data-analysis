It would be boring if all the games were similar. I think skyward sword does an excellent job with its pacing and story development as well as its dungeon design. I honestly can't say there is a worst Zelda game since they all bring something unique to the table. Which is why I love being a Zelda fan."

This is not a provable fact, just because you don't like it, doesn't make it a bad game. You can't just add the stipulation that anyone who disagrees is wrong. "
