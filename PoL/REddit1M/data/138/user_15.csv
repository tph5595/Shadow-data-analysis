8819,Looks closer to OoT than anything else imo.
8866,How about just a new Zelda game?
8889,"Why would they remake a game that came out less than 10 years ago, and still looks fine?"
8969,"The fact that this was downvoted suggests that a lot of people think SS is better than TP, and that makes me want to go on a little r/zelda killing spree.

Not that TP is the best Zelda game ever, or anything.. but SS is definitely close to the worst."

50328,IIRC Twilight Princess was a flop when it came to sales.
50402,"Oh I know, haha.  I was just being snarky.  We don't need a remake or sequel to TP, we just need a new Zelda game."
50469,That's not a 'remake'.  It's a buffed up version of the same game.
50756,"Oh man.. everything, pretty much.  I can't stand the art style.  I love Wind Waker and it's style - it's one of my favorite games, so I'm not just all about 'ohh this needs to be realistic looking' but Skyward Sword is like some mutant offspring of TP and WW.  It just doesn't look good.

It also holds your hand through the entire game, and that is something I cannot stand.  Especially the ""YOU FOUND A ----"" for the millionth time.

I also hate the fact that there's no real 'overworld' apart from flying around in emptiness.  Takes out a massive amount of the exploration/adventure vibe that Zelda is all about.

I could go on for days but I doubt you wanna hear me rant.  It just barely feels like a Zelda game to me."
77606,"That's a tough decision, seeing as I like pretty much every Zelda game, even Skyward Sword.

I'd have to say Zelda 2, though in ways I did enjoy it more than Skyward Sword.

It's not that they're bad games, it's just that both of them have things that I find very annoying/unsatisfying for a series of Zelda's quality."
