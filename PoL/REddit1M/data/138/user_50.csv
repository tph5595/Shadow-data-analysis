16688,This looks terrible.
113562,"The difference being that the models in skyward sword were designed to take advantage of this style / color palette; twilight princess wasnt so it ends up looking terrible. Also, the camera blur in the far distance to add to the painted feel of the visuals is missing here.  I'm sorry that i dont feel like this reskin adds to the look of TP.  Personally I felt that skyward sword looks much better than this for the reasons I stated. "
