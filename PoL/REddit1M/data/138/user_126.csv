""Oh look how grim and edgy I am, am i edgy yet guys???"" The entire game looked like it was painted with mud, it was just so ugly to look at. Majora's Mask was a much darker and unsettling game but it was also a lot more colorful. If you want to see how to do a very brown game correctly, look at Shadow of the Colossus. TP is gargabe in comparison.

SS on the other hand is exactly what I envision Zelda to be like, the colors embody the whimsy and adventure that Zelda has always tried to embody. Zelda has never exactly been a ""dark"" game in the sense of looking like horse manure."

85596,"To me, it doesn't feel very natural. I don't think Zelda has ever been particularly suited to being a ""dark"" series. I mean, Majora's Mask is pretty disturbing but in that game the inherent darkness just felt so much more organic to the way the game worked and the general setting. I don't think TP is the right way to make a dark fantasy Zelda. At no point in the game did I feel that it really benefited from looking the way it did. The game is just way too brown in all the wrong ways for no reason, and the content of the game isn't that much darker than Ocarina of Time or even Skyward Sword (Ghirahim was a lot more menacing than anything in Twilight Princess, in my opinion). The game just didn't use the earth color palette correctly, Shadow of the Colossus is even more black and brown than TP but looks a thousand times better to me. Despite the extremely noticeable attempts to make the game more ""mature"" and ""darker"", Majora's Mask is still the darkest game in the series.

 The funny thing is Nintendo explicitly said the art style was done to meet demand from north american fans who weren't so hot about Wind Waker, so you could say that it was ""forced"" in a way because according to what I read they were originally going to make a sequel to Wind Waker. It's fine if you like the way the game looks, but it just doesn't work for me.

Also, to be honest, I'm not sure what everyone means by SS being too ""cartoony"". I'm sorry that it isn't your cup of tea, but I don't think there's anything particularly wrong with how SS looks."
