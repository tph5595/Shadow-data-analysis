20033,"Nintendo has always made bad decisions. Great games, awful hardware decisions. Just look at all the accessories they've put out that were worthless. Or how they went from the giant of gaming, but upon refusing to move off of cartridges, lost that title to Sony and was barely able to contend in the next generation.

With that said, I don't think what you mentioned is a bad decision. On a personal note, I thougth Twilight Princess was ugly compared to other Zelda games. I always remember how so many people complained about Wind Waker being ""childish and cartoony"" before it came out, but most of them loved every second of it once it was out. History has taught me to doubt Nintendo on hardware, but optimistically view their sometimes strange design choices."

And Wii's sales might be good, but the console also represented a shift in focus from already established gamer demographics to casual players with little or no gaming experience. To people already in the gaming community, that's not necessarily the worst thing in the world, but it means their desires are now competing with others and are less likely to be considered. I can name more than a few people who bought a wii, played only a few 1st party titles, and then let it gather dust in favor of their other systems. Meanwhile a lot of non-gamer people fire it up all the time to play bowling. In the long-term that could be good for the industry and either good *or* bad for gamers.

But this is getting off-topic... uhhh... Zelda is neat."
