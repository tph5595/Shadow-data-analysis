50323,"Dude. I literally said this exact thing to a friend at work today. (Probably because I've been playing TP on Dolphin recently)

Twilight Princess gets flack for it's visuals ONLY because the GC couldn't do all they envisioned. Now the Wii U on the other hand will do all of that and more.

I LOVE the style that Windwaker had and I love the style of Skyward Sword, but my body is ready for the Zelda we've been waiting for. The one that you just described. And most importantly, just because it's more ""realistic"" *does not* mean Nintendo will forget how to make gorgeous graphics and unique art styles- they will. So even if it's a realistic game, it won't look bland- it'll look realistic with a Nintendo spin.

Anyway, how would you want Twilight Princess 2 to look? Or hell, how would you want it to play?"
