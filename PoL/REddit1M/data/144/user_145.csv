79659,"I feel like TP gets such a bad rap from people these days as they rush to prove they are true Zelda fans by praising Wind Waker and Majora's Mask. TP has its flaws like every game but it also has its strengths - a large number of dungeons, some cool items (that admittedly are not utilized to their full potential), and a large Hyrule to explore.

I enjoyed my time with it and want to go back and replay it eventually; however, it has not aged well, with the extremely slow opening (and first few hours) and muddy textures. Would be okay with just an HD conversion that touched nothing else. "
