12655,I can't listen to Midna's Lament or Queen Rutella's theme song without crying. 
13221,I have Borderline. My apologies for getting emotionally attached to a game.
15243,"Thank you. &lt;3 Midna is my favorite companion so far, and it's the fact that Rutella is a selfless queen on top of being a loving mother. I'm a very maternal person, so it makes me cry when she asks you to tell Prince Ralis that is mother will always love him. "

Some people are very easy to tears. A lot of us when playing video games we love and will develop an emotional connection to some characters such as Midna and start crying when that character is on their dying breath. Midna's Lament only plays during that scene, which is a trigger to make me tear up.
TL;DR: People have emotions."
