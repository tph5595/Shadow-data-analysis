18231,Really??? I LOVE the music. Matter of opinion I guess. But totally agreed about the dual claw shot. Soooo much fun!
18262,That boss fight is so much fun I've actually intentionally not saved after doing it so I could do it again a couple of times.
18339,Hah I brought mine with me after a half a year of not having it...I was having withdrawal symptoms.
18355,Well-said.
18450,"I had waited for an air temple since OOT, I don't think they had the ability to do it justice back then...I'm glad they waited. And when I found out there was a temple of TIME in Twilight Princess I had a heart attack of glee."
18864,"I agree that the villain change threw me for a loop but if they wanted to start with a different villain than usual I'm not sure they had a choice but to change it back by the end...Majora's Mask is amazing but it's a legend of Link, not of Zelda, without Zelda or Ganondorf. It was a choice they made that I can't really argue with.

On the other hand, while I think they might have been able to handle it better by making the friends more important later, I think the having friends in the village part and rescuing the children was important. Him leaving home and losing contact with his childhood is the ""mature"" part - like, see, this is what it takes from you if you become a hero, and you do it because you have to, but you lose things, you lose everything you knew and loved. That's even more evident because Ilia has lost her memory...you can't go home again in that game. You can't even pretend that you can. 

In Majora's Mask, it's really dark, but you can always go back to the beginning and every timeline that you didn't save suffers without you while you play around gathering masks and playing hide-and-seek with the bombers or going to the deku playground, etc.. In Twilight Princess, you're stuck in this hellish timeline where the world is turning into a land of death and monsters, and you can't go back or pretend differently. "

79847,Brilliant :D good stress reliever!
