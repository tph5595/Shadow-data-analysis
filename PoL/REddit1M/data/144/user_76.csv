18734,"&gt;And of course, the story. It is actually a good story. I'm used to most Zelda storylines just scooting by, and that was never a problem, because you don't play Zelda for the story. But TP has a mature, dark story line. There is real emotion in the characters. The opening scene where Zelda drops her sword in surrender and watches helplessly as her kingdom is overtaken. Such powerful imagery that is almost never shown in Zelda games, simply given in back text before the game starts.

ehhhhhhhh.

I don't really feel like the ""darkness"" in Twilight Princess was anything but superficial. I think Majora's Mask is actually a way more disturbing, melancholic, and legitimately dark game than TP without actually looking like it was painted with mud (that's another problem, the palette in tp was balanced really poorly). This is coming from someone who actually tends to gravitate towards darker and more serious stuff (my favorite narratives this gen are NieR and The Walking Dead game if that tells you anything).

I also don't particularly understand the praise for the story and characters. The faron people like ilia and colin get a lot of focus in the beginning but they end up being pretty irrelevant in the grand scheme of things and colin's character arc ends almost as soon as it begins. I guess some of the supporting cast like Telma are ok, but nothing too great. Besides just dressing it up in a slightly edgier coat of paint (which again didnt really enhance the game much), it's not really better or more interesting than WW or MM's plots.

it's a decent game but i just feel there was a lot of wasted potential."
18982,"I propose a different question: WHY would you play zelda for the story? the story beats in most zelda games are almost exactly the same and theres not a whole lot of emotional impact given how barebones most of them are. i really would not call nintendo good storytellers by any stretch of the imagination.

The only two zeldas that had me emotionally invested are Majora's Mask because of the unprecedented depth of the characters and the unforgettable atmosphere, and then Wind Waker for finally creating a version of ganondorf that isn't dull as dishwater. 

there are plenty of cool things in the series like the music, the dungeons, the sense of exploration, the puzzles, the atmosphere, etc, but i would never call the stories of the games a high point."
