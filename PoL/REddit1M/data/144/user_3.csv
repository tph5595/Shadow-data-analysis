3690,"The best memory i have with TP was when me and my big brother was home alone on christmas eve in 2006. He was playing and i helped him out with the puzzles when he couldn't figure them out. Just as we reached Snowpeak Ruins (5th temple), it started snowing outside, god that was so cozy. I've played it once or twice since then(100%), and honestly i think it's the best zelda game. Also, i'm planning to play through TP again, and stop when i reach Snowpeak Ruins, so when my brother comes back home we can play it together.  "

As long as my message gets through to you and you understand what i mean, it's all that matters, and in this case i think most of the people understood what i meant by that sentence ;)
