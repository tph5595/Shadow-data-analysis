16586,"DAE DARK ZLEDA?

I agree but I hear about how awesome tp is every other day and to be honest I liked wind waker more. Tp is still amazing though. I just think it's overpraised for its darker aspects but as far as game play goes there weren't very many secrets in the over world or anything. It didn't feel adventurous. BRING ON THE DOWNVOTES."
22385,"That's funny, from my perspective it's been the opposite. Maybe it's almost a 50/50 split?"
22761,You and me have the same opinion! I like the more mature feel but it seems so forced at times.
23621,"I would have liked TP more if it wasn't for the butt hurt mentality fans had toward Wind Waker, so maybe that has something to do with the shift in opinion."
26532,"Well the poe souls and bugs were more like collectables, the pieces of heart are standard (and there's less than Wind Waker) and like, 4 caves and a fairy grotto. The mini games were awesome though. Gotta play soon, it's one of my favorites, I'm just voicing how tired I am of hearing TP described as mature, because it just seems forced."
27143,"The fans saw a realistic demo of a Zelda game, so they thought it would be realistic to began with, and we were still pushing for realistic looking games rather than good looking ones, so it was seen as a step backward."
29837,"Wind Waker was my favorite, with TP being second, and it was unsettling to see a bunch of youtube comments kind of using TP as a tool to bash Wind Waker, so that kind of hurt my perspective on TP to began with."
30171,"Through the entire cutscene they were telling Link ""bro these things will turn ya evil!"" And that was never really expanded upon. Also, that cutscene was used in the IGN review as an example of how mature the game was, but it was soooo much worse than any other cutscene and they were selling it as the standard for TP. My favorite, on the other hand isn't really a cutscene but it feels like one, I guess, the part of the game where you shoot all those monsters (forgot their names) in that ghost town that was awesome."
38923,"Yeah, the one after *that* scene! I liked the part after where you're running around in wolf form, and you really feel helpless. I think the best example of a dark Zelda was MM and parts of TP that didn't feel forced, like the Midna thing."
38943,We don't talk about CDi...
