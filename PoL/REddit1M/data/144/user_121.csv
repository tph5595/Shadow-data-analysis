I personally did not like TP, I still felt sort of detached from the characters and the story. I didn't like shoving Ganondorf and the twilight realm in from nowhere and then closing the door on their role in Zelda. The ice temple was cool though, as were the clawshots and being able to run while you swing a sword."

I did not like TP very much, it was a cool game with realistic and darker-toned graphics but the characters were not very intriguing, and I felt the game lacking a bit in the idea of a world of exploration. I didn't like shoehorninf the main villain or the twilight realm, either."
