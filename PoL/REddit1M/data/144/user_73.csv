17294,"Twilight Princess is next in the timeline from Majora's Mask.  I didn't notice it until recently, but it shares a lot of unique aspects with Mask.  It's dark, the monsters are actually designed to look scary, there's some very real character development, and it's overall just more mature than the rest of the series.  I don't know if these parallels were intentional, but I love that sort of not so obvious consistency.

Also, the boss fights are fantastic, especially the triumphant music change when the boss you're fighting is vulnerable."
