First find your horse, then someone bitches at you because your [horse isn't pretty enough](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=gucVm2CVOrU#t=17). Then you have to play retarded sheep herding and fishing minigames before you can do anything?

All that crap that's nothing to do with Zelda, all crammed in at the beginning, is what really puts me off replaying this game."
