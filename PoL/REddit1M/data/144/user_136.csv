Midna's character changes over the course of the game, from hating Zelda for living in the light to understanding.  Unlike Fi or Navi, Midna has her own set of goals and a nice personality.  Ezlo was  like that too, but Minish Cap was kind of short and you didn't get to explore him as much.  
I go back and play all my Zelda games every now and then, and each time I play Twilight Princess I like it more and more.  
My only complaint is the Wii controls...you get used to them, but I have got to try it on the Gamecube."
