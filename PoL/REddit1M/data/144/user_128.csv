34725,"Yeah. Ocarina is by and far my favorite (and probably objectively the best, since every Zelda game since has been somewhat derivative of it,) but the soundtrack, besides a handful of songs, is pretty forgetful.

That being said, there are some exceptions:

* Hyrule Field
* The Forest Temple
* Lon Lon Ranch
* Fire Temple (With chant. It's utterly forgettable without it.)
* Final Battle (personal favorite)
* Fishing Hole
* Spirit Temple (Other personal favorite.)
* The Ocarina songs

I mean, a lot of it is just generic background music that would go in an 90's game. 

The rest of the soundtrack is forgettable or cribs *directly* from a Link to the Past. Some of Ocarina's best music, such as Zelda's Lullaby and Gannondorf's theme is from that game. 


I mean, the game doesn't even actually have the Zelda theme in it!

Ocarina of Time still has the best last battle of the series in my opinion. Wind Waker comes close, but Ocarina's fight just has it all: Big monster, Link fighting it, Zelda cheering him on and literally screaming and gasping any time Link gets or appears to be hurt, the wall of fire, the epic music, the night time thunderstorm in the background.
