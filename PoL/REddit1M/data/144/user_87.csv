22207,"Tp was my first so I didn't really know what to expect.  I was getting bored with the beginning part where you do random things around the village, and then the moblins suddenly break in, knock you out, and kidnap the children.  And then you find the big twilight wall, a big evil hand grabs you, and you turn into a wolf.  And then you wake up in a dungeon as a wolf with some creepy imp smiling it you.

My reaction: I have no idea WTF just happened but I think I might like this game.  And sure enough, it remains my favorite game ever."
