20037,"&gt;I love my GameCube.

Same here mate. The Gamecube was quite underrated. I recently set up my Gamecube (and N64 and PS2) with an old CRT TV as a dedicated gaming nook for myself, because my fiancee always wants to watch shit on Netflix via our main TV and I've had a pressing need to replay some games lately. Replayed Wind Waker a couple weeks back, then Metroid Prime and now it's on to Twilight Princess!"
