Edit: actually the GameCube was dolphin, as /u/NickDynmo stated"

It's a lot smoother of a workflow to go ""edit file"" -&gt; ""compress iso"" -&gt; ""restart emulation"" then ""edit file"" -&gt; ""copy to sd card"" -&gt; ""run to Wii"" -&gt; ""restart Wii"" -&gt; ""launch homebrew channel"" -&gt; ""wait for file patching and game to load"". Dolphin starts games a lot faster."
