- The tasks the game asks you to do between dungeons were redundant and felt like a cheap way to lengthen the game,

- Fi was very annoying and couldn't seem to trust you to figure things out by just blantantly telling you exactly what to do,

- The Gods endlessly telling you to ""prove your worth."" Do you not want me to rescue Princess Zelda or not?!

Other than that, great game! :)"
