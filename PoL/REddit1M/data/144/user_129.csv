35035,"TP is the only Zelda I gave up on.
I tried many, many times to love this game, but something about it just irks me.
I don't even really know when it starts, the beginning is beautiful, the first temple is awesome, the whole move control scheme works pretty good. All the Zelda elements are there, after the third or even halfway through the second temple the game just loses *it*.

More and more it turns itself into an annoying fetch quest. ""Hey Link, nice you're here, bring me item X."" But before you can get item X you have to finde item A, B and C first, talk to Person Y and then you get item X. And then item X proved itself to be useless, now you can raid 5 more temples, look for some other things, talk to 50 people and look for *more items*.

After I had to [give that girl her memories back, I forgot her name](/spoiler) I completely gave up. I felt like everything I was doing was useless. ""Nice that you found the shadow mask, but it's useless."" ""nice that you did this for me, but it's useless."" ""[Nice, that you found all the thing to bring back my memory](/spoiler), but I can't tell you what you want to know"". WHY AM I EVEN TRYING?
After that I just said to myself that everything I do is apparently worthless and I don't bother finishing the game. If these NPCs are too lazy to get their asses up and search for their own things then it's their bad, but I'm not going to move one more meter for these people.

The super gritty-dark-brown-muddy graphics aren't really helping either, for some reason these really prevented me from finding myself into the game. :("
