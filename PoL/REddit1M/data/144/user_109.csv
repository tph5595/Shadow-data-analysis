I was pretty shocked. To each his own though. I've heard a lot of people say they liked SS and I couldn't bring myself to get past the first 30 minutes. It felt empty or something. "

I felt the atmosphere to be dark, and I think that's all it really boils down to. A feeling the gamer gets while playing. If a lot of people think its a semi-dark game, it must have made them feel that way for a reason. Doesn't make them right or wrong, it's just the majority vote. 

Again, it's opinion vs opinion though, and I do agree that MM and OoT are perhaps darker. "
