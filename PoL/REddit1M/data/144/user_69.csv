16691,"What do you mean with no purpose, as in there was no backstory to the twilight realm existing or no additional gameplay elements gained from the twilight realm sections? The twilight realm was explained by one of the light spirits as the realm that the Dark Interlopers where banished to by goddesses of hyrule after trying to use sorcery to claim the triforce for themselves and was a pretty major part of the story, and all of the twilight sections where all focused on forcing the player to use links wolf form for a different gameplay dynamic and a larger emphasis on puzzle solving rather than combat like with the human link sections."
