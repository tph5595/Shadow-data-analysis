Although I think it's interesting we're completely opposite on opinions on Wind Waker (sort of, based on your initial impressions) and Skyward Sword.

I think among the 3D console games I find Wind Waker to easily be my favorite since it really shows how far you can take a style and carry it across the whole soundtrack, mainly the whole Irish maritime feel that Koji wanted. Dragon Roost is easily a standout to me, along with Outset island, Godhan and Molgera's boss themes and the oh so emotional Grandma's Theme.

I personally found Skyward Sword to be easily the weakest even after two years. None of the songs stick out to me besides the Ballad of the Goddesses and *maybe* Ghirahim's theme. But I find the overworld music for the regions to be far too ambient, lifeless and forgettable for me. I also just think it's stylistically just too all over the place but that's just me. Oh and the harp songs are so ridiculously forgettable. 

I too saw the Symphony of the Goddesses a few summers ago the whole Wind Waker movement really solidified how much I loved that soundtrack since it really captures the sense of adventure it had. 

I also noticed to myself that Skyward Sword to me just wouldn't hold up as an entire movement in my opinion. Thats why they only played Ballad of the Goddesses. I can't think of many other tracks that were super significant to the plot that would comprise of a fantastic movement for me. "

Heres Demise introduced at the final hour and oh yeah you gotta uh.. stop him I guess. "
