To be honest, I think OoT has some pretty memorable tracks, but overall had the weakest soundtrack.  TP has some pretty epic scores and boss battles I can still remember even though I haven't played it in years.

If anything, my one major gripe with TP is the absurdly long intro.  I'm counting every moment up to where you have to get your Sword and Shield in the village as the intro, and that's being lenient."
