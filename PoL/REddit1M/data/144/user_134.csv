37834,"One thing I really enjoyed about this game is the feeling of loneliness (maybe even apathy) you get from roaming around Hyrule. You are the only one traveling around (besides the mailman) between Castle Town and outlying villages and if I remember right, all these settlements do extensive trading with each other. But there are no caravans, traveling traders, or vagabonds. Just you and countless foes. I know the other Zelda games don't really emphasize this either, but something about standing one of the giant bridge (Eldin bridge?) at night and looking at the fields, Hyrule Castle, and the mountains and not seeing a single friendly NPC really makes the game feel vast and empty. I fuckin' loved that, a lot of people criticize the game for this though. To me, that empty lonely feeling you get is supposed to drive in the point that Hyrule is dire need of saving and you're doing is important."
