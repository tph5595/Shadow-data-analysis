11941,"|   And of course, the story. It is actually a good story. I'm used to most Zelda storylines just scooting by, and that was never a problem, because you don't play Zelda for the story. But TP has a mature, dark story line. There is real emotion in the characters. The opening scene where Zelda drops her sword in surrender and watches helplessly as her kingdom is overtaken. Such powerful imagery that is almost never shown in Zelda games, simply given in back text before the game starts.

What do you play Zelda games for if not the story?"
