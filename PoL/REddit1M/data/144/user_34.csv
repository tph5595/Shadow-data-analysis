10321,"I really don't see why so many people think TP's storyline is ""mature"" and ""dark"". Yes there's the whole Twilight Realm which is dark in the obvious sense, but I don't really see how it's ""mature."" If you want a Zelda game with a ""mature"" or ""dark"" storyline, play Majora's Mask, which accomplishes both of those things without shoving it down your throat. "
13429,Because it isn't. 
13699,Have you played Majora's Mask?
15320,"The Twilight Realm was put into the game with no purpose whatsoever. They didn't give any sufficient explanation or reason to its existence, why it needed to be in the game. The one you gave might have been the correct one, but I felt that the game didn't explain it well. It just seemed to me that the Twilight Realm was just a way to make the game ""dark"" and ""mature"". 

Link's friends (Ilia, Colin, that weird kid with the adult personality  in Ordon village are given such focus at the beginning of the game, only to be completely abandoned by the storyline after they're rescued by the Shaman guy. 

It's just trying too hard. Link's friend's solliloquiy at the beginning of the game about how the world changes when day turns to night or whatever, the cheesy emotional music they play whenever Link and Ilia or Link and Colin have a scene, the sudden change from ""Zant's the bad guy"" until the end of the game where they're like ""JK! Ganondorf's the bad guy!"" 

I just felt the game tried unncessarily hard to try to make the appeal to older players, where it just ended up being cheesy, incoherent, and almost pretentious. 

I absolutely loved every other part of the game though, don't get me wrong. I was just disappointed with how the story turned out. "
91345,"That's what I was saying. It's dark at a superficial level, but not past that. Just because there are some scary monsters doesn't mean it's actually dark. "
