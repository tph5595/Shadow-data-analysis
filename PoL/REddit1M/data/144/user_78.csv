19559,"Twilight Princess is good, but *easily* one of the least-dark Zelda games around."
19825,..People do?  The story is usually barely even there.  Zelda is about the gameplay.  Even Nintendo stated that the story is the last thing they think about when making a Zelda game.
20130,"Well, it's a game, not a book or movie, so...the gameplay?

Even Nintendo said that the story in Zelda pretty much an after-thought when creating the game, because it's about the gameplay being fun, and the story is irrelevant to that.  Usually, the story is barely even there, and when it is there, it's basically the same thing as last time... and that's okay, because it's not about the story."
21367,"...Anyone can make anything sound dark if you write it like that.

""Become the Devil""?  He became super-powerful, the same thing he, and pretty much every other villain ever try to do.  It's almost *exactly* the same as Ocarina of Time.  

Hell, even in Ocarina of Time, his presence had a lasting and massively devastating impact on the world, where in Twilight Princess.. you removed the Twilight and everyone was none-the-wiser, because that's how mild his effect was... nobody aside from the main characters even really noticed that anything was wrong, outside of one of two instances.  The 'dark' effect on the world was so minor that people were, at most, slightly confused.

They were turned into spirits?  **Tortured** by monsters?  They were kinda blue and glowy, and they generally went about their days exactly as they normally would, with a small dash of ""something seems off here.""

Seriously, you can still listen to them talk like they would every day when Hyrule Market was covered in Twilight.

I mean, Ocarina of Time had Market Town and Hyrule Castle completely obliterated, where Twilight Princess had... a quickly-removed barrier around the castle, that no one aside from the guards even seemed to bat an eye at.

Twilight Princess really isn't dark in any way other than aesthetics. In reality, it's pretty much just a lighter version of Ocarina of Time in almost every way.  I'd rate it, easily, as one of the lightest Zelda games there has ever been."
22809,"Nintendo also stated that A Link Between Worlds started out with no story, and then was just going to be a straight remake of ALTTP, before its actual story even started to develop.

I'm pretty sure that's from the same interview where they stated that the story is the least of their concerns when making a new Zelda game, which is from 2013 - just before ALBW was released."
34884,"It really is.  Think about all the 'dark' things that happen in most Zelda games.  *Most*, not all, but most are full of them, especially OoT and MM.  I'd ever wager Wind Waker had darker elements.

TP was visually dark, but that was it.  What happened in the game that could truly be considered dark, when compared to almost any other Zelda?"
34992,"My opinion is the same.  The game was alright, I do like it, but the best parts were the Ice Temple and double Clawshots.

I *kind of* liked the art direction, it was a step in the right direction... but *so* dreary and dull.  The character design was great, but there was almost no color and very little interesting scenery."
35105,"It's *somewhat* important.  Without a story, there is nothing to give direction to the gameplay.. 

But without the gameplay, there is no game.  Just a constantly repeating tale of Link fighting Ganondorf while saving Zelda."
35274,"I would much rather have it the opposite way - beautiful colors and art-direction, with a darker, or at-least more serious story.

I do like Twilight Princess, but it certainly isn't dark, and it definitely flops a few aspects."
35578,"I'm usually pretty good at finding things on the internet... but specific interviews tend to be notoriously difficult to locate.

However, I did find another interview while looking for it, that states:

""“We’re always trying to incorporate story elements into Zelda games in a balanced manner. If you’re saying that the story stood out more than anything else, then I feel like we need to work harder to achieve the right balance in the next Zelda game.”

when talking about Skyward Sword.  It actually sounds like he *wants* the story to be minimal, or at-least not the biggest part of the game.

45843,"&gt;They don't want the game to have such good gameplay

That is a silly thing to suggest about a game... Obviously, any developer is going to want to have to best gameplay possible."
83237,"I would say Ocarina of Time is *easily* darker, as TP is essentially a 'lightened' version of it.  I posted why, [here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1ruesj/hadnt_played_twilight_princess_since_2006/cdr8dbv)

I would also wager that Wind Waker had darker story elements, despite its very light art-style.  The same goes for A Link to the Past, despite it being essentially nothing but sprites.  I mean, Link's uncle dies about 5 minutes into the game.  Link's Awakening wasn't necessarily dark, but I'd say the ending was a lot more sad than anything that happened in Twilight Princess.

For 3D Zelda games, I'd say the two lightest ones are Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword.  2D is a little harder to judge, due to its restrictions, but most of them still did get a bit more serious that TP. TP just felt like... there was nothing really serious going on.  Twilight covered Hyrule, and barely anyone noticed.  Ganondorf created a barrier around Hyrule Castle... and no one, aside from the guards, batted an eye.  The world just had absolutely zero sense of urgency, fear, or darkness.  Ganondorf sat in Hyrule Castle, while Hyrule Market went by its usual business as if nothing ever even happened.

The very 'worst' thing to happen in Twilight Princess, was that your friend of, at max, a few months, left you at the end. "
83439,"See, for me, Twilight Princess's atmosphere was just... cartoony.  Aside from the Twilight Realm, it all felt rather 'bubbly' and light.  Most of the characters were rather 'silly', and even most of the enemies had a kind of humor about them.  I'd say the atmosphere, at most, was a tad melancholy at certain points."
138150,"The first link?  Midna goes beast-mode and cracks a barrier.  How is that dark?

Ganondorf... once again using a puppet that acts just like him.  How is *that* dark?  It might be dark, sure, if Zelda wasn't completely fine five minutes later.

And a trippy, metaphoric cutscene used to tell a tale that's almost exactly the same as all Zelda tales, with some pupil-less cliches on top.

The shadow beasts are... kind of creepy, yeah, I guess, but how about

Hell, even Twilight Princess's redead was reduced to an easily killed, slow moving, sword user... as opposed to, you know, eating your fucking brains.

That concept art is freaky as fuck, yes, and I *wish* that Twilight Princess had things like that.  I wish it was the dark game that it tries to make itself out to be, but it's not.  Most Zelda games offer much more dark aspects than TP has to offer."
