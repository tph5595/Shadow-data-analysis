I agree that the story is amazing, but I would disagree that the story wasn't important or interesting in any other Zelda game. Zelda stories have almost always been compelling to me, except in like, the first one, where it was essentially nonexistent."

For whatever reason though, a lot of people started seriously hating TP around that time, too, and it's just gotten worse.

I think both are fantastic games, personally, though I like Wind Waker more."
24149,"That's entirely possible. I never really understood the vitriol towards Wind Waker, anyway. I thought the art style was gorgeous, it was a lot of fun to play, the world was great, the story was excellent...it was just a fantastic game."
28414,"Yeah, I guess. I dunno, I thought the Spaceworld 2000 tech demo was neat and all, but I guess I just didn't give a shit whether my Zelda was realistic or cartoony, as long as it was a good game."
37642,"Yeah, I totally get that. It was happening for a really long time, before the perspectives seemed to totally switch, at least from all the places I've been visiting.

My personal favorite is ALttP, but I really can't say there's a bad Zelda game. The CDi games do not count."
