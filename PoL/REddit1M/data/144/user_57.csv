There are some small things that I liked, like being able to swing your sword while walking, or while on Epona. The hidden skills were also pretty cool, but I think they either should have been mandatory to acquire, or not even been put in the game.

The highlight of this game is easily the dungeons and bosses for me. I *love* dungeons that I don't immediately realize are dungeons (Snowhead Manor). Also, Stallord. I don't have to say anything else about Stallord.

Then, there's Midna. I usually don't like the ""I'm using you for my own motives"" characters, but she gets more development than anyone else in the series, so she's alright to me.

That's about all I like about the game. Honestly, the list of things that I don't like is much, much larger, but that's a story for another time."

26427,Agreed. [The song that plays during the Wind Waker demo is my favorite from the series](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3lPbv69Lj7k). It really feels like you're leaving home and going on an epic adventure.
26598,"Yeah, if you were to play any Zelda game strictly for the story, Skyward Sword would be the one."
27665,"Thank you. I feel that this needed to be said. I guess I can see why people like, or even love Twilight Princess. I *cannot* see why people think it's one of the darker games. Sure, the color pallet is filled with dark blues and dark greens, but there aren't really any moments in the story that I would describe as dark."
129194,What do you mean?
