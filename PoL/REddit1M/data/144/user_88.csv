22287,"Yeah it does include some of my very favorite dungeons: Arbiter's Grounds, Snowpeak Ruins, Temple of Time. And they did mix it up a bit with the items. I mean, three different types of bombs, explosive arrows, a scope for the bow...they did an awesome job. Though I will disagree about the music. I think that the music in TP is beautiful and some of the best. It comes across as some of the most emotional in the entire series."
22417,"Yeah I can get onboard with that. I mean I enjoy that it's dark and I like the brooding nature of the game, but at times it feels a bit forced. That's really my main problem with the game."
22478,"Definitely give the Gamecube version a go. I personally haven't tried the Wii version, but the GC version is spot-on."
22698,"I can understand the boring part, as it can get a little boring and tedious at time. But awful-looking I can't go with. I thought it looked gorgeous. They took the look and feel of many characters, monsters and locations we know and updated them to look even better."
29441,Especially *that* cutscene. You know the one. It was so ridiculously unsettling. But they were really **trying** to freak you out.
29517,I have never seen the pixelation that you speak of. It's always looked good to me and so has Wind Waker. But I enjoy Twilight Princess more.
33886,The Bulbins in the Hidden Village? One of my favorite parts. I love that whole part. My favorite cutscene would have to be the one where after you get all the Fused Shadows and Zant nearly kills Midna. The whole part after that is one of my favorites in the whole game.
46896,I guess I just don't see how that game's graphics haven't held up. To me it still looks great.
47011,"Exactly what I'm thinking. And most of the dark dungeons (Shadow Temple, Earth Temple, Stone Tower, etc.) are my favorite parts of the game. "
49020,"True it was meant to be gritty and edgy. I haven't really ever noticed it looking jagged, but I also haven't played it in months since my GC fucked up."
114235,Heh there are some people that are scared to death of those places and they freak them right the hell out. Me? I feel at home
