Ganondorf has ascended to essentially godhood (becoming the devil) and forces the twilight on Hyrule, which sees all the Hylians turned into spirits where they live in fear and are tortured by monsters.

I don't see why so many people praise Majora's Mask for being so deep when the same quality of storytelling and setting is evident in the other games."

You said you didn't think that Twilight Princess had a deep or mature story, and I asked you to explain why."

I guess my main difference is that I don't think dialogue is the main method of storytelling in the Zelda games, whereas you seem like you do. And I agree that Majora's Mask is by far the most fleshed-out in that regard."
