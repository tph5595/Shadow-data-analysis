16820,"I just finished Twilight Princess this summer, and it was the first video game I ever played. My best friend recommended it to me, and I went to her apartment all the time to play. We sat in her living room and we'd just play Zelda and spend time together. It took me a whole year to finish  it (I was really, really bad at the beginning, haha). We were both living in Japan at the time, and I finished the game the night before I moved back to the US. I cried a little during the final cut scene. Twilight Princess will always be really special to me. :)
