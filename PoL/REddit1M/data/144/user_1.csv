805,"Best dungeons and bosses in the franchise. Not the best sense of place/adventure but the scripted moments between dungeons were pretty amazing.

Also, dual claw shot. Nothing better in the series.

Majora's Mask is still my favorite, though.

EDIT: Also, while still great, I think the music in Twilight Princess in the weakest in the series."
5064,Agreed.
18048,"&gt; *while still great*, I think the music in Twilight Princess in the weakest in the series.

18292,I love the music too? That's why I said it was great. I just love the music from the other console Zeldas more.

27626,"Well, I grew up with Zelda starting from the first, and they all play out like the soundtrack to my life. I have so much sentimental attachment to all of them. I love them all, and TP is one of my favorite games. I just think the other games have better music. 

The original Zelda needs to get credit for the [main theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5biIXoKAHo), which still holds up as a timeless classic. Also excellent [dungeon theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMssCMqMHuk). Sounds great in [other forms](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8z7JPO08_o#t=36s). 

Zelda II is so underrated simply because it was radically different. But the [title theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2zxGm4cUB4) is one of my favorite pieces of video game music, especially looking at the iconic (for me) title screen. The [dungeon theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7a7Sh82Mzdc) is godly. Also sounds great in [updated form](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzR3osEYzIo). 

A Link to the Past laid so much ground work for the series to follow. [Zelda's Lullaby](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CPG2yDvD_08), [Hyrule Castle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_uR7doemZD0), [Dark World](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sslj06K-Nlw), vastly overlooked [Lost Woods](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ECnpMf1Tkc), [Dark Mountain](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smA-UGQIwX8) and still so many others I won't link.

Ocarina of Time, in some ways, started from scratch. The iconic overworld theme was nowhere to be found, and yet the [Hyrule Field theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zO8Y7hdD6Qk) became just as beloved. The [Great Deku Tree theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NsZTu9ikdTg) is one of my favorite Zelda songs. Of course there's the [Song of Time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t6Hf1-lQElE), [Song of Storms](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNwjUWKP18c), all of the ocarina songs for the dungeons, my favorite being [Requiem of Spirit](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=10CGIjH12FQ), but who could ignore [Gerudo Valley](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hy0aEj85ifY)? But my personal favorite from OoT is the emotional [title theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ShzyggtsCs) which is a variation of the flute music from the original.

If you've never been to the Symphony of the Goddess, you might not know this, but the Hyrule Symphony always does three encores, and they always end with Majora's Mask. The music for this game is unique, not borrowing a whole lot from previous Zeldas, and not a lot has been heard again. It's dark and powerful. It starts with the [title theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cYX3TLJnTVE), which encompasses the Clock Town theme, which is the game's musical undercurrent. The same theme with three variations depending on the day. But all along, there's a lurking ominousness to it which eventually overpowers everything else and it morphs into Majora's theme. Very creative, different and emblematic of the game as a whole. [Song of Healing](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDX4ZwUeOok) is somber, beautiful and shows up in several forms throughout the game. And who could forget the [Macarena of Time](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hazmV-zPaLI)? Easily one of my favorite gaming moments is the [Final Hours](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bc9zhmyrWA) of the Third Day, and the music is responsible for 90% of its impact. I do have to knock MM for having bad ocarina/horns/drums/guitar music, though.

When Wind Waker came out, I thought it had the weakest music because I didn't like the [Great Sea theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5J_bL2bjQ-k) being a variation of the classic overworld theme instead of just being the classic overworld theme. I also didn't care much for the maritime theme of the game and music, but as time has gone on, I've grown to like a lot of Wind Waker music. What always stood out for me was [Farewell Hyrule King](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7P2HNic7JjI). Another standout is [Dragon Roost Island](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRWq53IFXVQ). I don't like any of the songs Link plays with the Wind Waker itself, though.

Twilight Princess has some amazing songs. I think it's very close to Wind Waker in overall quality but just doesn't quite get there. [Midna's Desperate Hour](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dy4wSW7SNLo) is by far the best song in the game. I liked the otherwordly synth stuff of the [Twilight Realm](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bUwkjIXaHEI) but that's more for ambient sound design reasons than as a memorable song. As good as the [Hyrule Field theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRHoPxAfy_Q) is, and how cool it is to blend the original overworld theme with OoT's Hyrule Field, I just don't think it holds up against the originals as a variation the way Wind Waker's Great Sea did. I love the earthy, vaguely tribal sound of the pan flute [Kakariko Village theme] but it's so disconnected from the original that it should have fully been given its own identity. The [Hyrule Castle](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkj1z_l1aaQ)variations, merging them with [Ganon's theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40KLVC_ep38), however, are [insanely badass](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sucPf1OAx-0).

I haven't finished Skyward Sword, but already, the music is the best part so I still consider it above Twilight Princess. In any case, I love them all and had fun making this post because I just listened to a shitload of awesome Zelda music.

Have to just add a few more awesome songs that I didn't mention above. A Link to the Past [Light World Dungeon](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FVWpFXtHhPc), A Link to the Past [Sanctuary](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YgRX5BFfV6M). I don't even like this type of music but [this remix rules](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUo0MPzpBrQ). Spirit Tracks [Overworld theme](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5W_bFLwB0WY)."
28706,So cool. :)
