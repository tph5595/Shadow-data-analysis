46005,I too enjoy TP way more but I agree WW graphics have held up 1000x better than TP's. That's why it didn't make sense to me they re-released WW in HD instead of TP or any other Zelda game.
46059,Which one's do you think are darker? Besides Majora's Mask of course.

I'm not trying to talk shit on the game, and it doesn't look bad by any means, but an HD remake would look way better as oppose to the Wind Waker HD which doesn't look all that much better than the original imo.

Edit- TP was also made to look more ""gritty"" obviously."
