33356,"I firmly believe Wind Waker had the best music out of any Zelda game, and I'd pick Dragon Roost Island as the best single track.

I particularly love this [live version](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=61VWoXelamI).

WW had the best [title screen track](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o78T9-I4OGA) too.

And anyone who's missed [Wind Waker Unplugged](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uRv8gnBMiWM) is just missing out."
