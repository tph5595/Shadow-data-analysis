22437,"I just recently revisited Twilight Princess and finished it for the first time and thought it was damned good. I am surprised that a lot of fans dislike the game but each to their own.  

I think there were a few minor problems with TP but nothing game breaking. My main gripe was getting the horse flute thing so late in the game it made it pointless at that stage as you could transform to the wolf. For the entire game you are made to believe that Zant is a badass and then during his reveal he turns out to be a 2nd-rate magician who happened to bump into Ganon.  

But the rest of the game was fantastic - heaps of side quests, dungeons were really good (albeit the Water Temple and Sky one - I just didn't like them), story was engaging. One of the more memorable LoZ. I am hoping to play Skyward Sword for the first time in a few weeks"
