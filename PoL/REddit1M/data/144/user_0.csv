0,"After playing Skyward Sword and Wind Waker HD in the last couple years, as well as replaying other Zelda games... I forgot how amazingly awesome Twilight Princess was with it's dark, more realistic approach at the Zelda universe.

The amount of detail put in the game is astounding. I think Ordon Village by itself has more trinkets and insignificant flavor objects than the entirety of all other Zelda games combined. It feels like an actual village.

The interactions between Link and the people are pretty genuine. The game deals with so many subtleties of adult life that are often left out entirely of Zelda games. The scene in Kakariko village where the children are crying and the adults also accept their fate. Almost every scene with Midna brings a big smile to my face. Her dialogue with Link is amazing. Watching her roll her eyes playfully as wofl Link walks into the tower to meet Zelda for the first time--so many little things you don't notice. 

The 'realistic' take on enemies. The deku babas are no longer playful little cartoony piranha plants. They are grotesque, textured plants dripping with drool and poison, lunging at you with gnashing teeth. Even something as basic as the keese in the Zelda universe has received a massive overhaul.

And of course, the story. It is actually a good story. I'm used to most Zelda storylines just scooting by, and that was never a problem, because you don't play Zelda for the story. But TP has a mature, dark story line. There is real emotion in the characters. The opening scene where Zelda drops her sword in surrender and watches helplessly as her kingdom is overtaken. Such powerful imagery that is almost never shown in Zelda games, simply given in back text before the game starts.

TL:DR Twilight Princess is amazing."

Specifically, sometimes I have to shake the nun-chuck like 3 times before it finally registers that I want to do a spin attack.

It also gets really annoying waggling my hand for attacks."
