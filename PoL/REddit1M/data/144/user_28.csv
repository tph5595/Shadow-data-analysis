48756,"To me, ""weakest music of the series"" doesn't make sense. I'm not sure myself which Zelda game has the weakest music. Zelda has faltered in ways at time, but not really ever in the music department. I see nothing lacking in Twilight Princess's music to make it the weakest in the series though, it was definitely better than Phantom Hourglass's/Spirit Tracks for one."
