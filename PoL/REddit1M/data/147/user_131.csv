36172,"Male gaze is one of the biggest reasons. Generally, women in video games are designed to appeal to the male gaze...and men in video games are designed to appeal to the male gaze. This means emphasizing women as sexy and seductive, and men as strong and powerful. Both are not realistic, but it's not really realism that's the issue.

So, for me, it's not really about women having unattainable figures (but this is an issue), it's an issue about who is being appealed to, and what that says about the developers, the game, and their views on women and their audience."
118021,"That...emphasizes my point? Skin showing is not the issue. Character design and gaze is. In a romance novel, both characters are designed to be sexy because both characters basically exist for sex and romance.

Compare Kratos or Marcus Fenix to any of those men. Although both are very muscular, they are portrayed for male power fantasies. The men on the romance covers are portrayed for female sexual fantasies. The differences are pretty obvious: they're fairly youthful, masculine faces that are handsome, fabulous hair (this is more important than you realize), posed erotically, with generally flowing tops and tight pants, a stronger emphasis on parts of the body,  etc. 

Unfortunately, in my original reply I decided not to write paragraphs about the subject, but one of the points that I had initially intended to bring up was: it's not just about skin-- costume design is one of the most telling ways you notice 'the gaze'.

Let be pose a couple of questions: Do you think most women in video games are designed to appeal more to men, women, or both equally? What about men?

Can you honestly say that they're both not designed for men? And by men, for that matter."
