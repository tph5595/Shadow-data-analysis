41138,"&gt;  I was unaware the ONLY way a woman can be a good character is if she shows as little skin as possible.

No one's saying this. But it's insulting and poor design to make a female character who is oversexualized ""just because""."
42270,"&gt; And we know she's designed that way ""just because"" how...?

*Can* there be compelling, well-designed characters that just dress skimpy? Yes! But it's right to be skeptical when you see a character that appears to be specifically designed as a sex object--huge breasts, boob armor, etc. We've all seen this shitty sex object design a million times before, the rare times they're not that way ""just because"", they're rare.

Characters aren't people, they're designed by people."
43701,"Various reasons, sometimes including:

* It's insulting that female characters are very often just designed as sex objects. It's the designers (or whoever makes the call) that are being insulting, not the characters...obviously.
* It's insulting to be marketed to at the lowest level.
* It's insulting when designers *design* at the lowest level, putting together cheap, easy, unimaginative design that (again) just appeals to the lowest common denominator.
* Etc.

**All I want is for more designers to put as much thought into the female characters as they do into the male characters. I am so tired of how many designers think female character = sex object**. "
