9630,"For people upset at the boobs: remember, this is a SPIN-OFF TITLE. It is NOT being developed by the main Zelda team. Any and all complaints you have should be directed towards the Dynasty Warriors franchise developers, not Nintendo.  
  
That being said, the woman looks a lot like Veran from Oracle of Ages, and she dressed similarly provocative.  
  
EDIT: While I'm sure Nintendo has quite a bit of veto power for these sort of things, remember that there have been other characters just as skimpy in the Zelda series and this really isn't out of the ordinary."
11161,"If it were any other franchise I don't think people would be upset, but attaching the ""Zelda"" name to it would suggest they'd try to make it family-friendly. It's really not a big deal either way (it's not like she's naked) but I figured I'd point out that Nintendo isn't the one directing this game."
12894,"There have definitely been characters in the Zelda series that showed more skin. The Great Fairy from Twilight Princess at the bottom of the Cave of Ordeals was topless, only covering her breasts with her hair.

Granted, she doesn't have the same ""sex appeal"", but this new woman's design is very reminiscent of Veran from Oracle of Ages:

I don't think her design is really unprecedented for the Zelda series."
21881,"Well shes naked from the waist up, yeah. I just meant she doesn't ""flaunt it"", so-to-speak."
28447,"That's a fair criticism. Just remember that the people who designed her are Omega Force, not Nintendo."
