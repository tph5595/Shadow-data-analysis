25539,"&gt;They fundamentally failed to realize that women aren't simply comprised of a series of stereotypes. 

Welcome to Team Ninja.  They should just change their name to Tit's 'n' Shit."
25850,"It isn't even about the nudity/risque.  It's just tacky.  Looks like a design out of Soul Calibur or Dead or Alive, or the countless amounts of free MMOs with horrible character design.

Rather than ""whimsical nude goddess"" like you'd see in an ancient painting or something, it's ""hey look girls have titties!"" because that's what Team Ninja (aka Action Titties) does."
26161,"&gt;I think it has more to do with the fact that its historically been a franchise with a large younger/female fane base, and this art is very much directed at the 18-35 male demographic

I think you have that very backwards.  It isn't the fact that Zelda has been aimed a younger audience, it's the fact that Nintendo isn't tacky and immature.  This art is very much directed at horny 12 year olds, as is the case with every game Team Action Titties works on."
26276,"&gt;The only reason you see breasts is because 1.

It's *actually* because Team Action Titties is incapable of making a game that isn't filled with as much titties as it is action.

This shit is classic Dead or Alive/Free MMO ""look girls have titties!"" armor.  It really isn't comparable to any previous Zelda designs."
26599,"&gt;If Nintendo captures the concept and can give it their own twist

It's not Nintendo's game.  It's Team Ninja's and ωForce's.  "
26633,"&gt;Because it's Nintendo

It's not Nintendo.  It's Team Ninja and ωForce."
29100,"Yes... one of the very first pictures of the games, and already: titties.

You ever play a Team Ninja game before?  If you have, you should understand."
29282,"Yes, I understand that much, which is fine.  I know Nintendo isn't this tacky.

However, the one responsible for the titties is most likely Team Ninja, not Omega Force, because 99% of their games consist of 50% action and 50% titties and nothing more.  Sometimes it's more like 90% titties (see: DoA *extreme beach vollyball*.)"
31281,"No, that's not even close.  It's skimpy, yeah, but it's not ""extreme minimum nipple coverage bikini armor"" skimpy.  It's about.. 60-70% boob covered, as opposed to 20-30%.  Veran really isn't showing anything more off than her belly and the upper part of her chest (which is pretty damn 'normal' unless you're a strict catholic).  This new character is showing literally *everything* but her nipples, and a tiny amount of underboob.

But that's not even the whole problem.  The design is just shit.  It's the same old, done-a-million-times bikini armor that you see in every run-of-the-mill free MMO, or... other Team Ninja games.  It serves no real point other than ""look at these titties"", and is simply uncreative, unoriginal, and immature.

Also note that this is what, the third character we've seen yet?  So we know essentially nothing about the game, but one of the things we *do* know that Team Ninja is working hard to show off those titties, as they do in pretty much every game they work on.  Three characters in, and already, Team Ninja Titties.  Remember Extreme Beach Vollyball?  It's just what Team Action Titties does.  Kind of a shame that such a low-brow team gets to work on Nintendo projects nowadays."
