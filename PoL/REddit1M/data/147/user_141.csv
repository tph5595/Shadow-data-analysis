45706,"There's a big difference between 'mature themes' and softcore porn.

The great fairies look like traditional pagan spirits which entirely suits the atmosphere of Zelda games. This character looks deliberately sexualised in a modern way that just aims at tittilating the horny male audience. "

It's like you're saying no game or piece of media can ever have any flaw pointed out, because ""it's someone elses work"". That's a stupid argument."
52340,"&gt; It's equivalent to the dudes that complain about idiotic things like how much they don't like twilight books.

It's not equivalent to that. It'd be equivalent to people who were ALREADY twilight fans discussing that the newest book is oddly promoting racism and that they don't like that aspect.

&gt;It's media and whether you like it or not, that's just the way it is.

That's a bad attitude. We should demand high quality in our media and our products and not just meekly accept them when they are stupid, broken or demeaning.

Media is made for the audience and always reflects the society it comes from."

Now youre trying to say theres other opinions to consider (well fucking duh), but before you were just trying to silence my opinion for stupid reasons.

If I'm the only one that feels this way then just let me say it and let other people respond. You dont need to get all pissy and try to kick me out of the club. "

*That's when you know your main argument has been crushed.*"
