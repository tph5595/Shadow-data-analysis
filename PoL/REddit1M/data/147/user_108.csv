26322,It just doesn't fit in with previous Zelda titles. Something like Soul Calibur or Dead Or Alive which has always had characters with comically large over exposed breasts is OK. But this is uncharacteristic of the Zelda franchise. 
30290,I've never wanted a more adult Zelda game. I feel like that would be ridiculous. But that's just my opinion.
