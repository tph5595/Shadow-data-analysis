Nintendo is my favorite company on earth so when I hate saying this but there just becoming sellouts. Sales are down and now there hitching on the lowest denominator for sales. I dont care if Team Ninja or whoever is making this, the fact is Nintendo is finally to the point where there letting other companies make there games and they dont care about the quality of them as long as they'll sell. This is Metroid Other M all over again."

It isnt fair for women to be regressed to there sexual attributes while guys can wear bulky non form fitting armor. Zelda has always been known for its interesting and diverse looking characters. These guys are essentially just Soul Calibur characters.
