8051,The Zelda series isn't exactly new to female villains with cleavage.
11797,"&gt; The last one I played was Twilight Princess and I skipped WindWaker so I can't speak for anything after TP

That doesn't make sense, Wind Waker came out before Twilight Princess. Also, play it, don't make the stupid ""it looks like a kiddy game because of colours"" argument, it is easily one of the top 3 games in the entire series.


On topic, when I said the series wasn't new to female villains showing cleavage, I was talking about [Veran](http://ic.pics.livejournal.com/ancientskullkid/38305698/1766/1766_640.jpg), the villain of Oracle of Ages."
