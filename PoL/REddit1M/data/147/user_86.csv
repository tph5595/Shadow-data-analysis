It was casual, unheralded, and she was not used or presented in any way to titillate.  Unlike most uses of nudity I genuinely think this one successfully contributed to a sense of her being powerful."

That Samus is a unique character shouldn't have been seen by them as a sign that she isn't feminine, but rather that she demonstrates that games today fail incorporate the full spectrum of femininity.  They tried to shoehorn her into a role into which she does not fit, nor is it a role that she could need.

Quiet, confident, fearless, and powerful: all of these traits belong just as much to women as to men.  Developers should stop being so afraid to adopt those traits for their own characters."

It's when the amount of skin the character shows becomes the single most significant detail of the character's design that it's an issue.  Certainly, we don't have much to go off of here, but it doesn't yet seem that the design is going to matter so much as the emphasis it manages to place on her breasts."
