13486,"Have you? Zelda is the definition of family friendly.

EDIT: Since people don't seem to understand the concept of ""family friendly,"" refer to [this](http://www.esrb.org/ratings/search.jsp). Of the 23 games in the Zelda series, only one is rated T for Teen. That's as high as it goes. Five are rated E10+ for Everyone 10+. The rest are rated E for **Everyone.** That's 17 out of 23 games determined by the ESRB to be appropriate for all ages. How exactly is that not family friendly?"
13563,It's a spin-off in the style of Dynasty Warriors made by the people who make Dynasty Warriors. Look it up if you're unfamiliar.
14959,"There is a difference between what you describe (""happy funtime series"") and family friendly. A family consists of adults and children. Therefore it stands to reason that something that is family friendly is something that appeals to both adults and children. Would you deny that Zelda fits this description?"

Despite the fact that she's not actually wearing clothing, the leaves adequately cover her. It's definitely going for titillation, but it at least suits her role. The other is literally wearing a chainmail bikini like you would expect to see in a Korean MMO."
