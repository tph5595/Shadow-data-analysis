12063,Fat boobs don't count.
12207,"Then you missed the Great Fairies in OOT, and Midna in TP."
12237,Nintendo is not making this. The makers of Dynasty Warriors are.
12321,"No, it's not. Other M was supposed to be a main game series piece.

This is a spin off. It has NOTHING to do with the canon of The Legend of Zelda. Stop fucking whining about everything you don't like."
12352,Also Midna transformed. 
12365,Good thing you don't matter.
12453,"Are you really serious right now? A spinoff developed by a secondary studio who is know for making this type of game that has been confirmed to not be part of the Zelda canon is going to be the future of Zelda?

You're a fucking idiot."
12472,.....Zelda as a family friendly game? Have you PLAYED a Zelda game?
14803,"No, that'd go to Mario. Zelda is far less family friendly than Mario. I would not call it a series that a family could not enjoy together, but I would not call it a happy funtime series that you'd expect from Family Friendly."
19556,"Heavier, but not /u/xiaorobear link level of fat."
22071,"You mean the breasts that are at the bottom not even completely in the frame, while the character's face takes up the majority?

The only reason you see breasts is because 1. The graphics are better this time around and 2. people are already overreacting to it. Even more so, you're telling me that based on one screengrab of the character in the middle of a scene that we'll only get breasts and character as an afterthought. You're a real twat, you know that? 
I'm betting if the only thing we saw of Midna before the game was this image (http://img3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20120923065758/monster/images/9/9f/Midna's_true_form.png) you'd say she's overly sexualized.

I promise that if OOT was made today with the Great Fairies' models looking as good as that one does people would be up in arms about that too. "
22420,"Well, Four Swords was created in-house by Nintendo themselves, not by Omega Force. 

Also, the plot on the Zelda Wiki's page for this game does not seem too much like something Nintendo would let slip into their canon, nor does it seem like it'd currently even fit in anywhere. Especially since it begins with ""In this universe...""

***

In this universe, the Triforce was protected by the Witch Shia. However, the peace granted by its powers ended when Shia fell in love with Link and became jealous of Princess Zelda. Scorned by their honest intimacy for one another, Shia could no longer tolerate her seething rage and unleashed the ancient evils which were sealed away. Link's quest is to rescue Zelda and Hyrule from Shia's seemingly endless army."
22677,"I never said that Twilight Princess did not. I'm still pointing out that this character is no more sexualized than Midna was. If you turned her skin blue she'd basically have the same ""clothing"" to ""skin"" style as Midna. 

Except this character has a head-dress. A really fucking stupid head-dress.


***

A really **really** fucking stupid head-dress."
23049,"Ah, right. I forgot that FS was made by Capcom.

I'm trying to find where the plot came from. I'm guessing it was translated from that Famitsu article, but I am not sure yet.

EDIT: Yeah, it came from the Famitsu article. http://www.zeldainformer.com/news/new-details-about-shias-story-arc-in-hyrule-warriors#.U31WnfldWSo"
