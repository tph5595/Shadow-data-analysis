18220,I guess I don't have a problem. Why can't a woman be sexual? I was unaware the ONLY way a woman can be a good character is if she shows as little skin as possible.
20939,Maybe it isn't meant to be combat armor? Could just be that she likes to wear it around doing evil shit.
21100,"Implying sexualizing is somehow bad. I guess a woman in a video game that is sexual couldn't possibly be, you know, a character. Clearly the sexuality of a woman exists to please men and a woman couldn't be sexual AND a developed character..."
41550,"And we know she's designed that way ""just because"" how...?

Until we see the character in plot, dialogue, motivation, etc.? I'm not going to judge her as good or bad; she might be a very compelling character that also likes to dress skimpily.

You know, like how some girls in real life can be really smart, nice, and all around really neat people, but still like to go out in revealing clothing? "
43246,If characters aren't people why do we care about how they dress then? It's all a fantasy.
44809,You don't even know anything other than this character's physical design though.
