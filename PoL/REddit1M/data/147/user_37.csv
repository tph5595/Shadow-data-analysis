10362,"I think it has more to do with the fact that its historically been a franchise with a large younger/female fane base, and this art is very much directed at the 18-35 male demographic. I'm not one to complain about attractive characters but it feels pretty out of place. And it not being created by the same people as the main series doesn't really change anything, they still have nintendo's endorsement, and it is still part of the franchise. "
