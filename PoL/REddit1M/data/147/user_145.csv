I dont think they should have removed it. =/ It gave the sense that there were prisoners and lost souls in the temple,  which made it feel more raw and powerful."
50429,"If it bothers you that much don't buy it and don't play it. In fact you should make your own game and make it a point to not over sexualize characters since it's such a passion for you and all. I however,  actually have respect for game developers.  They have a vision for a game and they execute to make that dream a reality for every fan to play. By sitting there complaining about boobs in a game you're criticizing someone else's decision and creation.  So once again I go back to my main point.  You should make your own game and play that instead. "
50570,I don't understand where all the butthurt comes from. When I see a game that I don't like.  I simply just don't play it... 
51672,"I'm not saying you can't point out flaws. We have passed that line already. All I'm doing is offering you a solution. If having cleavage in a game somehow offends you.  Don't play it or simply make something better as you see fit.  Sure you can sit there and complain and boast your right to free speech and all that,  but personally I'm a fan of '' if you have  nothing nice to say then say nothing at all.'' This game is not attacking you.  The creators aren't making it to grief you.  They are simply creating a game that they hope will be good. So complain all you want. Become upset that some folks enjoy watching sexy women in FANTASY games. It's media and whether you like it or not,  that's just the way it is. It's equivalent to the dudes that complain about idiotic things like how much they don't like twilight books. The book is mostly for women and its what I assume an entertaining story with some passion.  Why the hell would I complain about that specific taste? "
88966,"Exactly. They might as well be saying ""I'm offended! Clothe her"" What happened to the freedom of speech? Cant a developer make a game however he wants? These people demand and cry because it doesnt seem right to them, but its just a womans body in a **fantasy** game."
89519,"&gt; That's a bad attitude. We should demand high quality in our media

The quality seems fine to me. Just because you're offended by it doesn't mean everyone else is. You use the words stupid, broken and demeaning like everyone views it that way. That's your personal view. If you look for something to complain about you most certainly will find it.

[Bean Seller](http://img1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20100215022152/zelda/images/0/07/Bean_Seller.png) is a bad representation of what the male form is supposed to look like and its demeaning. It hurts me as an America to see that because it assumes that all Americans are fat. We should fight this because its not only demeaning, but its stupid as well. Yeah.."
89774,Bad example. She didnt purchase a burger or the game yet. I dont look at random restaurants and assume that their food is shitty by looking at the pictures of food in their windows. I dont get upset if a restaurant doesnt look appealing because you know what I do at that point? I simply dont eat there...
89989,"There is no discussing with you guys. Your mindset is ""NO NO ITS WRONG!"". How the hell do you discuss against that. All you're doing is complaining. The simplest solution is to not buy it, but for some reason that an impossible concept to understand."
127342,"Hypocritical as hell.  You can argue about your boohoo game issues and women's virtual game rights, but I can't argue my point without being called ''pissy'' That's when you know your main argument has been crushed.  Next you should lobby up against porn industries for demeaning women.  I hear they're doing some fucked up shit over there. Refocus your energy into something that matters. Go protest or something. At least try to make a change. 

I'll gladly give you this info for free so brace yourself.  The general game population does not give a damn about your video game rights and preferences. You're like the Westboro Baptist church. You rally up about stupid issues that people just don't care to enforce. "
137934, You're speaking for me to try and prove your point and I'm not a fan of that kind of arguing. So you go justify whatever you need to. I'm tired and bored :). Time for bed.
