20555,"I wonder if it's actually a piece of the Triforce or if it's just a glowing mark like in AoL, the Oracles, SS, etc. After all, if Volvagia's skull still exists, that puts the game pre-OoT, but the Triforce shouldn't be able to be split up in any new games pre-OoT.

Or maybe the whole game is non-canon and the continuity doesn't matter. (Or maybe that isn't Volvagia's skull, and is just a costume put together in remembrance of the dragon many years after its death. Maybe it's even Barba's skull, which would put the game post-AoL.)"
20649,"We actually don't know yet whether the game is canon or not. The game *is* a spin-off, but Four Swords was called a spin-off when it first came out, and Nintendo regards it as canon.

I'm kind of expecting the game to be non-canon, but they could throw us a curve ball."
20732,"The Great Fairies in OoT and TP had comparable cleavage. But the graphics were obviously less, well... obvious back then."
22725,"Four Swords Adventures was created in-house by Nintendo themselves. Four Swords was created by Capcom/Flagship.

Do you have a link to that wiki article? Because you're right, that does sound a lot like this isn't canon to the main Zelda universe."
28446,"It was said in OoT, ALttP, and TP that the Triforce remained whole until the events of OoT when it was hidden in the Sacred Realm."
