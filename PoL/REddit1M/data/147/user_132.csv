37619,"I guess the Zelda universe needs to be stuck in the 1940's. Every single women needs to cover up her body. Boobs are something only Link can see when he's done rescuing her from the inescapable hold of Ganondorf. It's okay for male protagonist to show off but when a women one does it,it's risque. I for one am glad Tecmo Koei is adding a little sex appeal to the Zelda universe. "
