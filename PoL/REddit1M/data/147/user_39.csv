10854,Still trying to understand why anyone would complain about a nice set of virtual boobs..
12697,"I don't personally want the women in the game to be busty.  I don't care about it at all.  I just think it is a trivial thing to worry about.  I mean, they make most of the guy characters all buff and in amazing shape, and you don't see the mass majority of doughy husky guys getting all bent out of shape about it.  They just take their idea of what a person ""could"" but not necessarily ""should"" look like, and fill in their proportions.  It's just a game."
