Joking aside (no I actually do like them), I have played so many Japanese games and have seen enough over the top melons (looking at you DoA) that I like them. Not in the sense that I think the game is better with a provocative character, but that I don't mind some risque stuff here and there for eye candy. Now, if this exact character with the way she looks was in a regular LoZ game, yeah I'd have a problem with it, not because of the chest but because of how the characters are designed (yes LoZ is fantasy, but it doesn't cross over into over the top Japanese RPG/anime fantasy). Realizing that this ISN'T a regular LoZ game, and one made by the DW developers (which I like as well) these melons are completely okay with me, since I've come to expect that sort of eye candy from developers like them. I say, let us have boobies."
