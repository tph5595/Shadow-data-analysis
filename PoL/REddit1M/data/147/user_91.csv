68887,"It boils down to any time a female character in a game looks half naked, the community must react as a whole and be offended. Now not to say they aren't right, yeah she is a bit over the top maybe too sexy?, but when did that become a mortal sin?. Does every female character in every game need to be a strong representation of how strong women are by wearing full armor, or a have to wear a hijab?

I will say it again some people are trying too hard to be offended by tits. Here are a list of other characters from the loZ who are wearing ""provocative clothing""

Clearly more than enough evidence to show Nintendo has no problem showing the female body. People who are offended by this, justify it by saying it is immature, and it only appeals to 12-19 year old boys, and that is it degrading to all women out there, but that comment can work both ways. I can say the community is trying to censor the woman's body, and tell her what she can and can't wear and oppress women's rights. It is rather funny reminds me of the case in Israel where women walked around naked to protest a male dominated government telling them how to dress with a Hijab. Hopefully one day we can live in a world where a woman's body won't be in question by either American's stigma on anything sex appealing about the female body, or the Eastern oppression of the female body in general.
