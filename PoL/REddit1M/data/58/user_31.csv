18420,I'll agree with most of your points but to me Goht must be one of the most entertaining and original boss fights in a Zelda game.  Who doesn't love Goron mode and high speed chases?
19273,"I can see how someone wouldn't like the Goron races as the track is much more complicated and hitting other Gorons is discouraged by breaking you out of your roll, but Goht stands on a different level from them mainly for how exciting the fight is and I did replay it.

However, it would be marvelous to see the fight redone with more stable (stabler?) controls.  "
