27463,The way you fight them in SS. In SS you can go through all of them or pick which one you want then jump out and not have to fight the rest
27524,I want them how SS did it... That guy used his magical thunder dragon powers to recreate it
27546,Kid Icarus is pretty fun.
27573,It has tons of beautiful games
27616,I tried on my 6 heart hero challenge and I just can't. I'm still trying
27679,A mini game where when you beat it a thunder dragon crafts it for you to show you how great of a hero you are
27751,And it has such a nice feel to it. And it's harder then the couple before it
27870,"I want an over world like TP. Everyone complains that it's too empty or too big but I think it was perfect. It was small enough that you can get to your destination quickly(+ teleporting) but big enough that you can ride on epona, fine some hidden caves, and just wonder what it use to be like. There's so much destroyed signs of buildings and ruins"
27971,I loved TP bosses and dungeons. It had the best of both IMO.
30562,"I also liked their dungeons ideas. The sky, The snow palace, The first forest one. It had the best dungeons then any other game ( Except for maybe WW because I remember nothing about it because it was so long ago.)"
30657,"Zelda game isn't ever really a huge challenge. Maybe the first one or the second one but that was mostly because system limitations made combat suck. I think if you play zelda for a big challenge, then you're playing games wrong."
30728,They were sort of easy but I have no idea why he's saying rehashed. They were mostly original and the best bosses out of the series
30802,It's one of my favorite bosses because it was so fun. I also beat the goron race on my first try to I have no idea what you're saying there
30888,Why did you need magic milk? I didn't use and magic at all
31037,I would like Zelda with **some** side quests like skyrim but that's pretty much it. Just some mini dungeon/caves that are optional. It they make it too much like skyrim then it would be skyrim and not zelda
31094,"I basically want another TP but not TP because I've memorised everything in it from replaying it too much. And no wolf, I really enjoyed the wolf but feel it should be exclusive to TP"
31204,I enjoyed them so much. I find it so weird no one else does. Especially sky diving from the middle then landing on his head
31286,They need to have the cave of ordeals then another cave that's exactly like cave of ordeals but with bosses 
31318,Is scaldera the fire one or the scorpion one? The fire one was fantastic
31423,Only thing I googled was SPOILERS!!! taking a picture of the monkey. I spent way too long trying to figure it out and decided I wanted to not sit there all day.
31481,It's easier if you use zora and the button on the back right. You turn into a zora with blue coming out of you and can damage it way easier
32731,I used zoras boomerangs to hit it from behind 
37925,You're not very far into the game are you?
41382,This happened in the forest. You had to take a picture of the monkey and show it to the other monkeys
51493,I've never played zelda games for difficulty. They've all been too easy.
90483,It was but I think it should be a TP exclusive type of thing
