24894,"but in a game designed to have those bosses need to be replayed (especially Goht), would you rather make them more difficult, causing people to give up on the game, or make that sacrifice for the sake of the overall experience the game gives you? The first time you beat them, there are side quests and item retrievable that cannot be completed when you finish the temple on the second/third day. Hence, you have to go back. 

(I'm currently replaying MM - at Ikana now, so all of this is fresh in my mind)"
