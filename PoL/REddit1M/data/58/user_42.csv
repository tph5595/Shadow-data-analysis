20592,YES! One of the reasons I like MM more than OoT.
20617,And that's why there's a picture of a temple in Majora's Mask. Duh.
20687,Please no. We don't need a series of trails that lead to a bottle.
20892,"Haha. It's okay. Not a lot of players, even fans, would recognize Majora's Mask without seeing the Happy Mask Salesman or the moon... or Skull Kid."
21945,I hope you enjoy it. It was my favorite until Skyward Sword came along. I still play it over and over to this day.
