55292,"My main frustration with the game is that it would give you the same ""you picked up ""x"" even after you have 5+ of them. Not to mention I felt like the Motion+ system was a joke. It didn't feel immersive at all since it fell out of sync so much. I did however enjoy the storyline and artwork of it. "
