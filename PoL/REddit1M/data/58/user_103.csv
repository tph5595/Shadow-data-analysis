66024,"I loved how MM made it so you could go refight every boss and then go up into the moon and fight another boss just cause you could. Made interesting instead of starting a new game again. 

I think they should however incorporate some sort of item leveling system, or a karma type thing that they have in Mass Effect or KOTOR. It would add a little more RPG-ness to the adventure. "
