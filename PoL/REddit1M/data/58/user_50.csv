Power save mode isn't too helpful and I don't really like seeing the light level shift as I'm playing, it makes it harder to immerse myself into the game."

And holding the system at the perfect angle isn't always the most comfortable way to play. I can't imagine trying to keep the XL in the perfect position for longer than five minutes."
