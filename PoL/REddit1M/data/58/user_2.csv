5367,Skyward Sword has the Lightning Round. Ton s of fun. You have to fight them all without healing. Kinda like a gauntlet. 
24583,I think of it as a gift Link earned for reliving his nightmarish boss fights. It's definitely better than buying it from what looks like a ten year old. I do like how in OOT it's in that grave though. 
59041,I meant in Twilight Princess.
