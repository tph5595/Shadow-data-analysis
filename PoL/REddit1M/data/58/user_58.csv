27078,"&gt; Lots of people hate on it, mainly because there's only 3 main areas you visit

I wouldn't call it hate. A lot of it is justified criticism particularly the points that there's no real overworld, the sky is largely just empty space, it takes a very long time to get anywhere in the sky...they just echo the complaints people had about the Great Sea in The Wind Waker, which were also valid. Having to fight that /particular thing/ three times was also very, very, very blatant filler. 

I enjoyed Skyward Sword and plan on replaying it soon, but the whole game felt like there was a lot of very blatant padding in making you move slowly and repeat tasks that served no purpose other than to artificially increase the length of the game. "
