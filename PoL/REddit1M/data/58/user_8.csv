11574,"A heart piece for beating four in a row, the indestructible Hylian Shield for beating eight in a row and 9,900 Rupees for beating all of them. (Twelve?)"
24401,So Link having to relive his most difficult battles over the course of his journey to win an indestructible shield forged by the Thunder Dragon Lanayru himself isn't epic enough for you? Besides even in the game it was introduced in it was just a common shield you could get for like 80 Rupees with several opportunities to get one for free.
