26903,"It's my favorite, personally.  You'll enjoy it if you go into the game remembering that it focuses more on combat and other action than the exploration aspect.  Also the cinematic direction is absolutely flawless."
26955,"[With Dark Link at the end, what an awesome reward!  :D](/spoiler)"
27040,"Twilight Princess had some epic bosses, but they were all insanely easy."
27194,"I love the repeated Imprisoned fights.  They're not too easy, and the first and second are spread out enough so it's still impactful when you see it again.  The third is close enough to the second to make it feel super dire, like you're not going to be able to keep it sealed much longer at all.

And it has the added bonus of being Groose's catalyst for magnificence."
27287,"Seriously though it would be cool to see that make some kind of a comeback.  At least *some* sort of customization, the upgrade system in Skyward Sword was a great step forward."
27553,"Post-Ocarina of Time, sure.  Skyward Sword upped the difficulty a bit (and has Hero Mode, of course)."
65875,"Ghirahim was a great challenge that actually requires you to be relatively competent with the sword.  Koloktos was awesome.  Moldarach required you to be quick enough to stay out of danger.

Overall, it was much better than Wind Waker's Kalle Demos which you can *easily* defeat in one cycle.  Or Twilight Princess's Fyrus which was dreadfully unchallenging and uninteresting, or Morpheel which was absurdly un-threatening."
65903,"Agreed, it's a system that needs to be developed now that it's been proven to work."
