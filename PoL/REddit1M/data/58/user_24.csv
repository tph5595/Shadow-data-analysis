16959,"I loved Majora's Mask. It's my favorite game of the series.

But those bosses were only ever frustrating (Goht, Gyorg) or completely uninspired (Odolwa, Twinmold). Majora too I always felt was pretty disappointing because as a gamer I am completely incapable of not collecting everything, so I always have the Fierce Deity mask by the end of the game.

I will say I eventually got the hang of Goht (you kind of have to given all the goodies in the Snowhead area, most notably the Gilded Sword), but I would have never *asked* to fight him or any of the other bosses again. I simply *had* to because of how the game is designed.

Not to imply I hate fighting bosses-- Twilight Princess had the best bosses in the series (I would fight Stallord any day of the week!), but *most* Zelda games have bosses I'd rather not fight a second time."
18246,"I completely agree! I didn't even know a Zelda boss could be fun and mechanically creative until I played Twilight Princess. Other games in the series had bosses that got close, but TP hit it out of the park."
18660,"The problem was the mechanics of the Goron wheel spinning thing never really felt that smooth. It always felt jittery and hard to control. I mean, did *you* enjoy the Goron races? Most folks I hear list it as their least favorite part of MM.

If Goron racing's controls were tight and fun to control (like Zora swimming, for instance [unless we're talking about banking in a sharp turn, in which case never mind]), then Goht would have been a really fun boss if for no other reason than the creativity of the concept. As it stands it's mostly frustrating, manageable if you have to (and like I said you do have to several times)."
19180,"Twinmold was a bizarre mix of clunky and uninspired. The Giant's Mask would have made the fight incredibly easy, but because it drains magic it's mostly annoying. Why does it drain magic, anyway? You need the Giant's Mask to fight Twinmold, and you can't wear it anywhere else, so the *only* reason it drains magic is to put a time limit on the boss (and make it really frustrating if you have to drink a potion or two to fill up).

Great idea, terrible execution."
