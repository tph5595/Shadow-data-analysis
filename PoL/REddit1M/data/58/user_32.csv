18708,"Majora is a lot funner if you don't use the Fierce Deity Mask. I always feel a connection to my masks so I never give them away at the end (i have done it before, though, just to say I have) so I fight Majora just as Link. Still kind of easy though, especially if you grab the Infinite Magic milk beforehand. Also, what's with only being able to use the Giants Mask in Twinmold's room? That mask is friggin useless except for that one time.

Yeah, I was very disappointed with the boss for Stone Tower. Such a fantastic temple deserved a fantastic boss, but it didn't get it. "
