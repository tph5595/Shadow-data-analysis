68054,"I agree that Odolwa is really boring. Twinmold wasn't really fun to fight either. Goht was really fun! But Gyorg... **fuck** Gyorg, man. My last play-through of Majora's Mask was a 3 heart/no fairy or potion/no sword upgrade challenge. Gyorg was awful to fight, because he kills a 3-heart Link in two hits. I had to master the art of jumping into the water, damaging him, and Zora-swim-jumping out of the water without screwing up. If I mis-calculated the jump out of the water, it was basically an assured hit from Gyorg.

For those curious about other trials and tribulations that I went through:

The Majora fight was awful for a different reason. Majora's Incarnation has a spark move that isn't perfectly blockable by the shield, and Majora's Wrath has some tricksy whip hands that don't always telegraph what they're doing. Majora's Wrath also took 40 hits with the Kokiri sword.

Igos du Ikana had an attack which I perceived to be unavoidable: his [flying head attack](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=axi_Amy2QSc&amp;t=123). This guy is using the bunny hood; maybe I should have tried that. I was able to avoid it sometimes by rolling at just the right moment, but it felt like the intention was for that attack to be unavoidable. Also: holy crap, this fight is much faster with the gilded sword.

All-in-all, the bosses and Iron Knuckles (one-hit kills) gave me trouble, but the normal enemies in the dungeons and overworld didn't."
