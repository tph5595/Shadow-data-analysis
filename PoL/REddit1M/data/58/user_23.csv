16911,Darknut is a normal enemy in that game. The final room of the Cave of Ordeals has you fight like five of them at once.
19284,"You fought all Darknuts by whittling away their armor. The one you fought as a min-boss in the Temple of Time is actually weaker than the ones you fight in Ganon's Tower and the Cave of Ordeals. Darkhammer is a mini-boss from the Snowpeak Temple who you fought in order to get the Ball and Chain. You fought him by hitting him in his exposed tail, though."
