45492,Design wise the bosses were fantastic but the difficulty was too low they were easy to avoid and didn't do much damage.

Between the imprecice controls and the chaotic bouncing it's just really unfun. When I make a new play-through I don't even bother getting the fierce deity mask because it's so bad. "
