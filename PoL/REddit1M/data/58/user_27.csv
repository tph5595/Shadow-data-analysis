17562,It made sense in MM at least.
17735,"They want Skyrim with Zelda gameplay.  At least, that's what it sounds like."
17871,"Nope, that's only the first one you fight.  It's incredibly tough as ~~I don't think you have the Master Sword at that point, and~~ you don't know it's attack patterns or weak spots.  They're still formidable later on, but you have much more power, skill, and moves (if you did the Hero's Shade quest) at your disposal."
18035,"I feel like TP was the best at designing challenging, fun bosses that all felt different.  None felt too gimmicky or too fustrating, and they all had a nice difficulty level scaled to the rest of the dungeon without being unfair."
18811,"Zant in particular was a favorite of mine, and I loved the final boss.

Well, the *final* final boss battle was a bit underwhelming, although quite badass and intimidating."
18837,Shh don't bring up my hopes like that.
19908,"Whoops.

I had a feeling I was wrong about that."
22288,"Could you elaborate on your point?  Maybe provide some reasons or examples why?

I'm not trying to be contrarian, just interested in why you feel that way and what bosses you liked."
27271,I think the same could be said of most if not every single Zelda game out there.
