The game is a masterpiece plain and simple, but I have to see it as a product of it's time, as a piece of art, and it's just a fact that art is mostly only abandoned, never completed. The missing temples and the black and white boss battles at the end are examples of that to me, and make me ponder what was left on the cutting room floor of WW. It's a part of what keeps me coming back to Wind Waker, makes me think of why Wind Waker was a masterpiece to me as a kid, why it's still a masterpiece now, and what it could have been given more development time.
