19583,"I like the idea that the overworld is in itself sort of a dungeon too, with puzzles and objectives and whatnot, but I think what people hate on is the fact that exploration was a bit nerfed.

In between dungeons in the other Zelda games, I usually like to aimlessly explore the vast plains of overworld (or Great Sea if we're talking WW). SS didn't have much of that, since every area had a purpose and was constantly changing. The only place to do actual exploration was the sky, and there wasn't too much to see on each of the floating islands. It was a nice experiment, but I did miss the exploration of the old games."
43948,My sentiment exactly. TP was actually my favorite game when it came to exploration and general fucking around. WW would've been number one for me were it not for the super cumbersome sailing between islands.
