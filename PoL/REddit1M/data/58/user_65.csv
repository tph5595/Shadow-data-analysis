I have all of the above as well, save for the original two... but I do have the NES cartridges still and they're my babies. To be honest I almost forgot about the Four Swords remake, heh. Should get on beating that I guess, but it's just not as fun playing without my buddy. We killed each other so often in the Gamecube version, took us months to finish it. xD"

That back light is a lifesaver... literally. xD When we'd be in GBA mode I'd take full advantage of my buddy's lack of one, thus throwing him down a hole, bombing him to steal his force gems, or lighting him on fire and letting him fall down holes himself."

No idea where they are now though, probably living in a box full of other various cords somewhere... for some reason, they were always nowhere to be found when I wanted them, but would pop up months later. Good old selective gravitation..."
