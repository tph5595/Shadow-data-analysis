14691,"A mode of transportation is pretty integral for a 3D Zelda game. Epona is in 3. The bird and the king of red lions replace her in the other two. 

And they have the animal pals in the Oracle games as well. "
14989,And illicit criminal types tend to use rom hustler or rom nation as well. Pretty shady stuff those people are up to. 
15064,Not really. It wasn't exactly empty. There were enemies all over the place. 
46977,A lot of them are shortcuts or merely rupies. A handful net you some tokens. 
47368,"First off, if it's on land, she'll make a comeback. 

Second, here's a new idea: huge dungeon where you actually have Epona. Maybe puzzles that you need to be on horseback for. Or areas that you have to traverse on horseback, like waist high water or something. 

Third. How about a massive boss fight where link has to chase after either a colossal enemy walking towards a major population area or a flying enemy like a dragon. Something more than hit it with someone else's arrows and smack it. Like run up and and jump on its legs, run up its back, and stab it in the neck sotc style. 

Imagine having to do that with a massive spider as it wanders towards a village or even hyrule castle. Oh, and there is a time limit. "

47861,"Lances, involving her in sotc style boss fights, having a dungeon where you need her (of several), and of course, more fetch quests. "
48103,"That being said, larger RAM and large disc space will probably mean larger temples and a large field that isn't empty. 

Now, that doesn't mean they'll be that big. But they will probably will add back a lot of cut stuff from ss (which was probably cut because of Wii limitations.) like day night, a proper over world, more items, and hook shots that work on all wood again. "
76491,That's what I meant by tokens.
