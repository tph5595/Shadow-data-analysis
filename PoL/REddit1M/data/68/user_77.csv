47305,Link is the only playable hero. Should they create a new hero too?
93596,"I wasn't comparing them like that. When it comes to the ""newer"" games, OoT and up, all of the other forms of transportation besides Epona seemed to lack in luster. Sure, she didn't have a huge role either, but she fits the atmosphere more in my opinion. Like in Spirit Tracks you had a train. A fucking train. At that point in real life we already had guns for a long time. So should Link have had a gun? No. It was simply a poor choice of getting around. Like someone else said, I didn't even finish the game. Hell, I would have preferred the damn kangaroo. "
