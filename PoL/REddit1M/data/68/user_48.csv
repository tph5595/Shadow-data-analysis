20717,"True, Epona is better than the shitty loftwing in SS, but she wouldn't have really fit into that game and I respect that.  Same goes for WW.  And those stories were amazing and also not possible without the settings, which did not allow for Epona.  In the end, it would be nice if the next one had her in it, but if the setting doesn't allow for it then that comes first before trying to squeeze something into a game where it doesn't belong."
