21529,"I would really not mind having Epona again, but only if the overworld dictates a need for her. If the next game's overworld is a huge, sprawling place (I personally hope for an overworld about the size of the one in Shadow of the Colossus), then having Epona would make sense, and it would be awesome. Also, it would be really cool if she felt more like the horse in that game, too. I always felt like Epona was WAY too responsive for a horse. I mean, you can back her up like a Lipizzaner stallion, for crying out loud. 

Now I want to play Shadow of the Colossus again."
