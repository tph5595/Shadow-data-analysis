17890,"I understand that people complain about the big empty field filled with enemies, but what I disagree with is the nothing to discover. In my humble opinion, Nintendo did a hell of a job creating an overworld that's beautiful and makes you stop in certain areas just to enjoy the view, just like in the real world. And they even incorporated secrets here and there! Caves to explore with multiple tunnels that had you worried if you had enough lantern oil, markings on the walls that made you wonder how on earth you'd get up there (until you got the exciting new item, the Spinner), little shining bugs to collect, but had to watch your back in case an enemy was approaching, meeting with the Resistance (even if they may have been short), keeping an eye out for a town when the sun sets hoping someone is selling lantern oil, and I'm sure I'm missing more. 

But you see, all of that is similar to how a person would behave if on a real adventure. Enjoying the view, visiting large (or deserted) towns, and finding little secrets along the way. TP was more of a story of a young shepherd discovering a huge world outside his little village, and I for one lived every moment of it and glad I had Epona with me to share the world. 

On top of that, you had a secret that only a handful of people knew. The ability to turn into a wolf is a looming secret that had me feeling very lonely, especially during the first cutscene in Kakariko Village. The children were scared and you couldn't be with them or comfort them or tell anyone what you were up to, even though you were right in front of them. This is emphasized more when Midna is with you at that moment and calls you a poor lonely hero. Hyrule field in a way amplified the loneliness because of its open emptiness, but having Epona with you was comforting and made me feel powerful. 

I can go on and on about TP. IMO, Nintendo did an excellent job with the design of the game. 

TL:DR - Yeah, TP is definitely one of my favorite Zeldas. :) "
