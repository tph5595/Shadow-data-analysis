1154,"i disagree. i think Epona is more like having all 4 jars. awesome if you do but if you don't, it will just make things a little harder for you. for example, i didn't even know Epona was able to help you in Ocarina of Time. i finished the game without a horse and then when i was reading up on the game i was like....""Epona who?"" plus i like link having only one method of transportation. if he has a boat and a horse in Wind Waker... it would have just felt like link was being carried everywhere he needed to go rather than exploring and struggling, same goes for Skyward Sword"
1585,"right. i kept wondering where the horse was, but i never whet out of my way to find it. for the longest time i thought it was in the Gerudo Fortress, locked up with the other guys. but i digress, you dont need her. "
