16709,"This is actually why I want a game with Hyrule at the height of its empire. I've always said that Hyrule still feels young in OoT, and then it feels like it's past it's prime in TP. So some game in the middle, when Hyrule was a real kingdom with everything a kingdom is supposed to have, would be amazing. And then Hyrule field might have some stuff in it. Like better established roads and maybe some soldier's outposts or something."
16917,"In TP, until you do the challenge with Epona to get that Zora kid to Kakariko, you can't get into Kakariko Village from the south without Epona, and you can't get from East Hyrule Field to South Hyrule Field without her either. "
17122,"That's the point. And I actually don't think that a game that size was possible until the WiiU, when they switched over to BluRay technology for the games."
17511,"It took me a while to find this link again, so you'd better enjoy the hell out of this article. [WiiUDaily](http://wiiudaily.com/), who is a reputable source of current Wii and Nintendo news, wrote [this](http://wiiudaily.com/2012/09/wii-u-zelda-game-coming-2014/) article about what their Nintendo source told them about the upcoming LoZ game. It's not speculation, it's not rumor (hell some of the stuff in that article I recognized from G4TV and IGN interviews with Miyamoto), it's from Nintendo. Expect to see a lot about it at 2014 E3, and maybe a little about it at 2013 E3. Because it's happening. In the fall of 2014."
17827,"Wolf Link wasn't faster than Epona, but if you only had a relatively short distance to go (like say, across East Hyrule Field) it was definitely easier to transform into a wolf and dash the whole way there than to call Epona (which you could only do from anywhere late game), then wait the few seconds for you to get on her, then run there. Transforming into a wolf was a two button hits, and a half-second cutscene, and you're ready to go."
20970,"People have asked me this before, and I always seem to read the tone as negative. And that confuses me. Elder Scrolls is a great game series. Am I saying rip them off completely, except with Link? No. Am I saying that they should take a look at those games, and borrow some of their ideas? Yeah, I am."
34786,"Yeah, I know that. THat's why I said you didn't get the ability to call her from *anywhere* until late game. In fact, using the horse call plant is part of the opening gameplay. Still, this plant was very sparse, and never seemed to really be there when you needed it."
50047,"Maybe they could cover the Hylian Civil War? OR some kind of war where Hyrule is trying to claim the Gerudo as their own. You know, Manifest Destiny and all. This war probably would not be with Gorons or Zoras, seeing as they are both usually well-integrated into Hylian society."
52581,"The Gorons and Zoras seem amicable too though. Why would they be fighting? They are especially amicable in TP, when the hot spring is shared by both Zora and Goron, and there those Goron that just sit at the bottom of the water in the Zora Domain (still curious about that one)."
