It could be done, especially if it's like early 1900's era. No laser guns, or super-highways. But roads, motors, old masters in sacred pagoda's protecting the ancient and sacred realms of their peoples."

Where I think Guns and motor bikes belong, mainly because of the developments shown with steam engines, and canons. They just might not take the form we immediately recognize. Zelda may be the look and feel for some, but for me it's about a timeless story, and innate feelings in all of mankind as we struggle with the tri-fold balance of Wisdom, Courage, and Power. Not to mention saving the princess, and overthrowing a tyrant lord. If Spirit Tracks weren't 'eroding' the game, then I don't see how this would really. 

*Edit: human online to human only, Freudian internet slip."
14712,"I see your point really, and I wouldn't want to see modern gunplay. Maybe since it is a separate world. a more primitive go at Motor Cycles, and some adaptation of old pirate 8-ball guns. I would like to see the gun as kind of a sling-shot bomb item you know. Maybe something you couldn't use all the time because of Ammo restrictions etc... Maybe it could get magic upgrades like the Arrows of Fire, Ice, and Light. Mainly I guess What I would want out of this, is to ride a motor cycle through hyrule field lol.

PS&gt; also my idea is just a fanboy pipe dream. Unless they decide to do some wild kind of change up."
17556,"in my games it would be an Epona Motors motorcyle. But it would probably just have like EM and a horse logo, and people on the internet would eventually be like ""Dudez EM was Epona Motors"""
