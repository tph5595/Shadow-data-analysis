10907,"I also missed epona, especially in my second playthrough of SS because of how let down the flying aspect of the game was. Having that said, I would like the next means of transportation, whatever it may be, Nintendo put a little more effort in it. I think a lot of it has to do with how the over-world itself affects the transportation aspect. 

So for Oot, Epona was kind of just a fun additive to the game but she wasnt really necessary, as other people have pointed out. In MM epona played a more integral part in the story and you actually needed her to progress, but it was really only for one or two parts of the game and from what i remember, there wasnt a whole lot more to her than that. In WW, the boat was really just used to get from point A to point B and the player needed it, but it didn't do anything else game-play wise. But what was interesting was that the boat played an integral part in the storyline and actually had a lot of depth and emotional appeal, for those of you who beat the game you know what im getting at. In TP, it was a little more balanced and Epona had both emotional ties and a lot more gameplay elements to her. But like MM, you really only needed Epona a few times, admittedly in the times you needed her it was pretty fun and epic but those instances were scant. Combined with the wolf transformations and transporting, there wasnt a whole lot more Epona could do. Finally with SS...the bird was just plain bad. The idea was there, and it was a cool thought, but it played the minimalist amount of effort possible. The best part of the bird was encountering Levias, and i found it to be very enjoyable, but that was literally it. There was no swooping down between giant islands or flying among flocks of birds or combat elements, it was just so incredibly limiting.

So what I think Nintendo should do is really flesh out the role of the means of transportation and to do this they need to spend time on the overworld. By this I mean places to go, sights to see, items to get (NOT RUPEES) and battles to be fought. I want to love my transportation not use it because I have to.   "
