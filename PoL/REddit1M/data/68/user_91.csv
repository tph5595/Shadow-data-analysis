98099,"Whilst I do not believe it is necessary I feel it is an under-appreciated mecahnic, particularly the twilight princess version. Of course, in wind waker it wouldn't of made sense as your boat would have to be a lot bigger to have a horse on it, unless Epona can teleport. It wasn't really needed in skyward sword and I felt the ground exploration was good. If there is an epicly large overworld like OOT then sure.

It would be interesting perhaps to have different transportation methods for different needs e.g. epona for ground, loftwing for air and a boat or maybe some other creature for aquatic. Of course, that could get complicated and you'd need a damn good reason why you can't just fly everywhere. Though if loftwing was only for sky areas like in SS then it could work. "
