2956,"Yes, I do. Well, maybe not necessarily in the next one, but at least in another one coming up. I think the games without Epona are still great, but I do love Epona. In Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess, I would spend time just running around on on the field with her, and I loved horse archery and the races. "
31094,"I wouldn't want to see another horse. True, Epona's been the only horse, but she's only been in what, three games? I really like Epona, I think she has a great personality. She's very feisty, and she's loyal to Link. "
40493,"Haha, nooo, I enjoyed her in Majora's Mask too! I just didn't feel like Termina Field was as wide, open or as scenic as Hyrule Field. I also was always on a mission in Majora's Mask due to the time constraint, so I didn't think much about wasting time with Epona. "
42107,"Right? Epona definitely has a strong personality, I feel like you don't choose Epona, she chooses you. Link's the one who had to win her over with Epona's Song. And in Ocarina of Time, if I remember correctly, Ingo gets pissed because he can't control her. And when Link is a kid, Malon's the only other one who can approach Epona.  "
