33094,"I always enjoy having Epona in a game, every since I made it to Lon Lon Ranch in Ocarina of Time and had a good laugh when I first ""met"" her, since me mum is a bit strange and gave me the middle name Epona, based on the Celtic Goddess of horses and horse breeders. So now everyone asks me if my name (because I use my middle name everywhere) is from LoZ even though I predate OoT by quite a few years. Lol! Regardless, a huge Loz I am ;)"
33157,Me youngest bro's middle name is Dragen...she wanted to name him Eragon. (There's 21 years between me and the little one) Sigh. Me middle brother's middle name is Lee for some reason. Don't know how he got away without an unusual middle name.
