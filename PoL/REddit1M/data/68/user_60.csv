29665,I certainly hope so. In my opinion she's a vital element in many of the traditional Zelda titles. I mean how awesome was the whole [riding horseback on Epona while firing arrows at the Aliens during the Romani Ranch Invasion](/spoiler) in Majora's Mask? Kinda awesome. I felt the same connection I had with her when playing The Shadow Of The Colossus and riding Agro. I still love Epona more.
