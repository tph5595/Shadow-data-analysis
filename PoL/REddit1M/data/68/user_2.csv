1420,Did you never watch the title sequence!?
1499,Having a horse would be nice but only if there's an interesting overworld for the horse to navigate. Epona was fun in Twilight Princess but her playground was RUBBISH.
1746,"No, you're right. That game already had warps everywhere."
11141,The point of Hyrule Field is to add an extra ten minutes to when you want to get from A to B? That's bad game design.
11173,Nintendo haven't said anything at all about a new Zelda and anything you've heard is a fake rumour
11211,"But what more do you want from Epona, then? If you want to do all that just load up Twilight Princess"
13964,"I'm not saying Epona's boring or a bad part of Zelda, or that I wouldn't want her in a new one, but I don't see why you would have her on the wishlist, if you know what I mean? If you can't think of anything new to do with her, I don't see why you can't be satisfied with what you already have."
15751,It's a hoax.
16023,"Until you give a link with some evidence, commenting with more rumours doesn't make this Zelda game any more true.

I'm sure Nintendo have one planned but they haven't said anything yet."
16501,"All the enemies do is slow you down, though. You either go round them or fight them. They don't get any more difficult as the game progresses - they never actually are difficult. It's satisfying every now and again but they're just padding - just things to stop you getting to the next new thing quicker."
16643,Exactly. Nice succinct way to put it.
16739,"Okay, those are good ideas. I don't think you need Epona to do them, but I like them. I do think an entire temple where you need Epona would be excellent, especially with a Shadow of the Colossus style boss at the end."

It's not from Nintendo. It's a hoax.

Wii U Daily and Zelda Informer are notorious for writing traffic driving articles with rumours that don't pan out to be true."
