35130,"No. I don't know why so many people in this subreddit just want remakes and re-hashing of old ideas. I loved horseback riding, sailing, horseback battling/running as a wolf, and while loftwing riding could have been better, it was still great. I say  keep moving forward with new ideas. I can't wait to see what new thing comes next"
35258,"Totally agree, plus the music was amazing"
35353,Proof please?
35415,Completely agree. It would have been great if you could use your loftwing on the surface
35579,In full support of this. I'm envisioning an almost steam-punk style zelda. We need more machine-like items like the spinner in twilight princess. I'd also love a crossbow instead of a regular bow

&gt; 3ds exclusive

&gt; Majora's mask as a bonus

WAT :|

37218,"While i agree with you, i just don't think twilight princess did enough with what it had. I think more could and should have been done with all of those"
37297,"Fully agree, and i think that's why people freaked out about skyrim way more than anyone did about zelda, because it was a massive world with tons to do at every corner"
52707,yeah. skyward sword's music was amazing. my only complaint was that none of the songs were quite as catchy as some from the other games.
55956,oh definitely no doubt
81154,"yeah, but why 3ds exclusive? and they would never put a remake in the same game with a new release."
