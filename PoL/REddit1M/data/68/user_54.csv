23933,"I look at Borderlands 2 and just how MASSIVELY huge the worlds are in comparison to TP.  I didn't really play SS (hated the controls, though I do need to give it another chance), so I don't know the scale in comparison.  I hope that the next Zelda is just MASSIVE in scale.  I love big worlds with a ton of Easter Eggs and things to find.  "
