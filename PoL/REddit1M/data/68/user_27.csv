I think one of the key elements that makes the franchise charming is that it exists in it's own very distinct universe, sure Hyrule shares certain things with medieval human culture (swords, clothing etc.) but I don't think guns and motorcycles are necessarily where the world is heading. Besides that, there are plenty of other games that already have badass male characters toting shotguns and it would be a shame if Zelda's unique universe was just eroded into another generic action franchise with a Zelda coat of paint."

Not that I think Nintendo will decide to take that direction anyway."
