8835,"I certainly share a lot of your feelings, and I really like when they use Epona to good effect. I don't feel she's integral to the series, though. My first game was LttP, so I'm more used to the running boots than a horse. In every handheld Zelda I can think of, you're horseless. In all the games before OoT, you had no horse. OoT, MM, and TP are the only ones I know of with Epona, and I think they were more true-to-life with horse anatomy on OoT than TP. [I honestly can't look at the scene with Epona rearing after you've saved Colin from the Bulbin without cringing.](/spoiler) [Derp.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-4jIuqvqQo&amp;t=1m16s) Don't click the links unless you read the spoilers. [The way Epona arches her back, plus putting all her weight on *one* hoof  and shifting that hoof on a bridge.. not to mention the way she arches her back.. Best example of a rear I can find on youtube is in the next link.](/spoiler) [Herp.](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGe7JJrBB34&amp;t=0m04s)"
