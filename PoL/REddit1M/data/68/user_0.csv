0,"To me, Epona is an integral part of a Zelda game. It's probably the reason TP is currently my fav game as Epona in that is awesome. Fighting on horseback, vaulting on/off and looking badass riding round the field.

I loved WW but there was something missing. I didn't enjoy SS as much but imagine how good Epona would look in that art style. OOT was my first game and she seems necessary now.

Plus, Epona seems *way* underrated in this subreddit - give her some love.


Anyone with me?

**Edit: to be clear, I am talking about the 'big screen, 3D games' rather than the handheld or older ones. It seems like a lot of what is talked about on this sub are OOT, MM, WW, TP and SS so I didn't think to clarify... My bad!**"
1671,"I'm def with you in the one form of transportation it would be ridiculous to have a boat and horse, or bird and horse, but I didn't enjoy sailing and the flying was really lacking. 

No a horse isn't necessary but it is so much fun and for me makes the game epic. "
1951,"What? No! You could go round and round the field through the passages, into the villages, jump off ledges and fight off moblins on boars :)"
3424,Me too it makes the game really enjoyable
9171,I think that was a downside of TP but I don't know how you could integrate that with a horse? Unless of course you could jump into new areas...
9315,"Ooh I hope not I don't have a 3DS! And love the 'big screen' games.
Did you find the wolf faster than Epona? I def found Epona faster. But I also just enjoyed riding around on horseback!"
9391,Fair point but I've only played the 'big screen' games and she's in 3/5... the image of Link on a horse is also slightly iconic imo
9475,That's def a reason I loved WW... just not as much as TP and OOT - they had very different atmospheres. I love playing WW when I feel like a light-hearted game.
9502,awesome
9598,Yeh my feelings too. A couple of people on here have suggested a 'sequel' to SS where Link discovers more on the surface and links the areas together. I don't think it would ever happen but would be a cool place to reintroduce Epona.
9670,No... I mean it was fun for like 10 mins? Idk I just never loved flying and you could only fly around one area.
9859,"Yep I used to work with horses and that massively bugs me too... but once you're on the horse it's more about that feeling. If they (hopefully) bring Epona back surely this time around they could get the anatomy right!

And I have to say I'm thinking of the big screen games rather than the hand held ones."
9922,set in a modern age then? i think that would be cool but would probably stray too far from the concept
10029,well a horse seems the obvious answer!!
10435,you make it sound good - how do you think the green tunic would look this time around?
10534,Ok i admit I haven't played the first 3 - I honestly thought they were handheld ones. I started with OOT. Would big screen 3D be better?
10963,could i play these on an emulator? I don't really have money for a new console...
11380,"Hey, that's an awesome answer. 

I am so with you on the bird - the thing didn't even get a name! It could have had (and so could the game) so much more to it. It was a great idea just not finished.

I don't think that Epona needs to be necessary to the game for you to complete lots of it, I just feel that she is a really strong aspect of the newer games and having the option to ride is one of the things that really attracted me to Zelda in the first place. I think the TP story was the best for her - there was enough to do and as you said emotional ties. Not everyone loves her so it is good to make her 'optional'. But a game where you could use her to visit new, non-crucial areas would be amazing.

So yes agree with you pretty whole-heartedly! Here's hoping for the next game."
11404,I might just be!
11506,"Well there's more to the Zelda games than that one aspect... Quite a few other reasons to want a new game.

And what I'm saying is that TP highlighted how good/fun Epona can be."
11604,Oh obv me neither - i was only asking theoretically so i could avoid that avenue... i wont be going *near* visualboy or emuparadise...
15381,"Because it makes the game more fun for me - that's my opinion and what I want in a future game. Of course there is more stuff do do with her - discover hidden areas, fight more bosses, transport other characters where they needed to go (that would be awesome), she could be used to swim across areas that Link couldn't swim to, and help Link out of more situations (think jumping out of Lon Lon Ranch). I think there is a **lot** more to be done with her if so required."
15459,OK! OK. Can't do straight away but I promise. It had better be worth it!
15830,"to be fair, if zoras evolve into rito and the kokiri into koroks then anything is possible"
16944,And fully rounded out characters - that would be amazing. Big big game though.
17044,Yep although it already had much more than OOT concerning Epona. If there was another leap up next time I would be very happy.
17234,"Using Epona for a whole temple would be pretty cool, especially if there was trick riding involved (standing up for example?) or having specific items to be used in conjunction with her - maybe a lasso! Or some kind of jousting lance... "
17420,i think your motorcyle is my horse... which is why i've been banging on about Epona!
17837,"If they could do it and really extend the game with more side quests, optional items, story lines etc it would make a great game. I couldn't imagine one that big coming out until at least 2015 but if it was that good I wouldn't complain. I guess you could also incorporate meeting characters who could fight alongside you!"
17909,Yep it wouldbe more extending on the Ralis thing and making areas optional
21609,"yeh i was saying somewhere above it'd be awesoms to do some trick riding for tasks, or items revolved around riding eg. lasso or lance!"
21708,"I agree, and although I loved WW I tend to prefer the worlds of OOT and TP, they feel more like Zelda to me. I think I'd like the next game to come back to that."
21991,exactly why i love that game :)
1755797,"Happy Christmas!!

edit: totally agree, class class class"
