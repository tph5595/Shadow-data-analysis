7109,"I kinda enjoyed Epona in TP, but when you can transform into wolf freely I typically was doing that to move faster.

In games where you can't transform into a 4 legged animal I would say it's nice to have. I HATED the trains in Spirit Tracks and Never finished.

I think the WW world is just not for me. Play wise, not art wise.

I would love to see a sequel to TP that was 3ds exclusive. Maybe even include MM as a bonus or something."

15159,Minish Cap was tons of fun. Cap was a fun way to incorporate the annoying sidekick by making it purposefully annoying as well as literally attached.
15268,Wind Waker world. Includes Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks
79234,"TP is the sequel to MM. MM is the sequel to Oot.

They said 4 Swords was sequel to TP. I want to see something with an older Link."
82316,Like LttP and 4 swords?
82428,"Anyway because OoT is a port. 3ds needs a Zelda title to itself that actually uses what it can do.

I am sure they are already working on WiiU and 3ds Zeldas anyway whether or not they have announced it."
82763,"So get this. Remember the mission where you ride Epona and are security transport for the carriage and have to shoot all the Moblins?

I didn't know you could lock on with the bow by pressing ""L"" or whatever the wiimote equivalent was.

I did that entire mission by AIMING THAT SHIT. It was hard. Then like 2 dungeons later I found out the lock on and was like...""oh damn."""
