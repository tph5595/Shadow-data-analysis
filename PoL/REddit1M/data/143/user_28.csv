133153,The first DLC won't be much use to you until you get the Master Sword so you could wait on it. Unless you want the new armor (Which aren't needed and you would probably be wearing something else anyways) you don't need to buy it right away.
203159,That's true. Don't know if I want to replay the game just because it's a little bit harder than a game that's pretty hard already.
