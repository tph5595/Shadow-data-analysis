You may even spend over 200 hours, especially if you are trying to get every shrine and/or korok."
572610,"Do Vah Medoh (bird) as early as you can, as it gives you an ability that will be very useful, especially early on. Vah Naboris (camel) is known to be the most difficult one but it gives an ability that will be useful for stronger enemies. Vah Rudania (salamander) is often seen as the most boring one, but the ability it gives is also very useful especially early on.

The way I did it in my first playthrough was elephant-salamander-bird-camel, but I recommend elephant-bird-salamander-camel."
572847,"The ancient shield (I don't know if it counts as a weapon) is good if you are not confident in your parrying skills, or if you are planning on farming Guardian parts. Other than that, the ancient bow is the 3rd best bow in the game, best in general excluding amiibo equipment and one-time use weapons."
573016,"If you are in an area inaccessible by Bokoblins or Moblins, they will throw rocks at you will can be hit back at them with a shield (or any melee weapon). Octorocks also shoot rocks at you and you can deflect them, but the rock will only bounce back at the Octorok when you are a bit closer to them as they quickly duck back into the water/ground."
573075,"To add on to what u/vgbhnj said, Master Kohga is also a required fight."
573273,"Bokoblins, Moblins, and Lizalfos won't attack you at all as long as you don't attack them, or another enemy doesn't attack you. Lynels also don't attack you, though they will only do so for about a minute before they realize you're wearing a mask."
573381,"If you are looking for more of a challenge, try the trial in master mode. "
573594,"If you are talking about the silver Lizalfos on floor 10, [here](https://howlongtobeat.com/game.php?id=38019) is a video showing off a good strategy how to do it. (1:44:37)"
573679,"Additionally, you can take a picture of the Master Sword in the Trial of the Sword, after the end of any trial, if you got the DLC."
574014,"Thunderblight Ganon is MUCH harder in Master Mode, but aside from that, that's pretty much the only blight fight you may have trouble with."
574102,"The final boss is harder, but still pretty easy if you have the right gear."
575490,"Oh, I thought they were talking about an all divine beast playthrough."
