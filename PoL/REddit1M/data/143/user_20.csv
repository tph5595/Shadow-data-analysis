If you're completing Major Tests of Strength fairly efficiently, you're not going to have many problems with combat going forward.

My opinion is that the Gerudo Divine Beast (and boss fight) were the most challenging, but also the most enjoyable in terms of figuring out how to manipulate the beast correctly.

I would say that the Zora Beast has a comparable manipulation mechanic, but isn't as intensive as the Gerudo Beast. The Zora boss fight was also not terribly difficult, with the trade-off that the Zora story was my favorite sequence from start-to-finish.

The Goron Beast might be the next-toughest boss fight, but the section that precedes boarding the Goron Beast wasn't as much fun for me (in that it's [a semi-stealth mission and the Champion protege is a bit annoying to deal with](/spoiler)).

The Rito is the easiest Beast and boss fight, but the Champion Skill is super helpful when it comes to exploring the map.

Because you have so many options, it's really up to you as to how you'd like to proceed. Personally, if you're hoping to complete the map in full, I would suggest going north from Gerudo Desert to the Hebra region and do the Rito story, then go to Zora's Domain, then Death Mountain.

The general consensus here has typically been Gerudo &gt; Goron &lt;--&gt; Zora &gt; Rito in terms of most-difficult to least-challenging. I don't think you did anything to jeopardize your playing experience by doing the arguably toughest region first."
