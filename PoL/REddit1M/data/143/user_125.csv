537526,"I did not played BotW yet, but I'm extremely curious and excited about the hard mode. I like hard games, and I'm disappointed to hear that the difficulty of the game on normal drops to the ground after you get stabilized with your gear.

Surprisingly enough, there is simply no topics about the hard mode, or even a mini guide or review. So, I have some questions, if you know any answer please let me know. 

- How masochist would be playing BotW for the first time on Hard? People say that the starting area is insane even for these ones who already know the game. I don't mind if it is hard, but it would be borderline impossible for first timers like me?

- The game manages to keep challenging for the whole adventure, or gets easy later on (like the normal mode)?"
