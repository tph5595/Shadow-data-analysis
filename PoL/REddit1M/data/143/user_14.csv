60897,"I'm at the Yiga Clan Hideout. This place is bullshit tbh. It's definitely the least fun I've had while playing this game. The room with 3(?) blademasters sucks. Are there any tips I can get to make this room less of a bitch?

E: Just watched a video that had a much easier path through that room, I'll try that tomorrow."
62443,I think my problem is that I was going to the right as I enter the room and the best path is going around the other way (the left as you enter the room with the 3-4 blademasters)
