81844,"Throughout the Yiga Clan Hideout, there are a lot of bananas... I had a very frustrating time here also at first but remembered that the Yiga Clan REALLY loves mighty bananas! When in the room, I would first hide, then go to my inventory and hold a banana, then toss it as far as I could in front of them. Once they see those yummy bananas, they get excited and pay almost all of their attention to the bananas! Then they go to get the bananas you just threw out as bait. (It is actually pretty funny to see. Like a little tip-toe dance walk haha) Once they go after the bananas, I let them pass by and I just ran up behind them, one sword swing, and they're done! Repeat until you make it through. 
Also, before turning right to enter the room, if you go to the end of that hallway, there is a ladder that goes to an overlooking edge you can use to help plan a path through the room... and there's also a room FULL of bananas up there... 
Don't know of this is the best way to go about getting through the room, but worked for me! Hope this helps! "

Once you go to your inventory, hold your bananas, and then return to the game, you can only toss the bananas maybe 10 feet or so in front of you. if you press the down button, it will move your white drop circle out further. Then find a good spot to toss those 'naners and once they're vulnerable and focused on their vitamin C intake, run up behind them and take 'em out! "
