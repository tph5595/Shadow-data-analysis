474309,"I have feeling I'm going to be disappointed in the answer to this question, but what the heck.

I bought BOTW on the Wii U. Planning to buy a Switch, however. Is the save data transferrable by any chance, or will I have to start from scratch?

Mostly wondering because I'd like to play Xenoblade Chronicles 2 eventually."
485024,Dang. Thanks for that. Guess I'll have to consider if I want to continue on Wii U or restart. :D
