The article explains what every single Zelda amiibo can give you."

Most people will follow the quest points that appear on the map when you follow a quest. So go to Kakariko village early-on; followin that direction, and kinda explore around it. Follow story quests this way for a bit.

Once you feel less overwhelmed by the huge map you'll feel more able to go beyond your comfort zone. :) 

Have fun!"
