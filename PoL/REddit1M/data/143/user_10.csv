All the references from the Adult Era (WW Timeline) are spelled correctly, where they references from other timelines are misspelled or jumbled. Just an interesting insight, not a hard decision on the timeline placement. "

The only way around this is to actively turn on/off the protection during the fight, which will allow you to focus the camera again. You will need to learn to use the stick if you like using this ability often."

193515,I say it would be a good call if you want a challenge. Doing the game in hard mode would be brutal and rewarding. Plus in your first time adventuring you may stumble across the hidden chests that contain the dlc's new items.

But there reaches a point early on where you master the fighting mechanics. Once you get used to the fighting system I would switch over to hard mode, you'll probably find it more rewarding."

I need someones help on how to creatively fight Lizalfos with rune abilities (like bombs, stasis, etc). Does anyone have a good tactic against these guys, especially when in a crowd?"
