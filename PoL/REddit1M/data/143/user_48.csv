203094,"There's this one kind of Korok Seed challenge that I just don't get - the little windmills on tree stumps. Where am I supposed to shoot at? The one near the river in the Dueling Peaks region is the one I struggled with in particular today.

Got the game on the Switch last week after swapping in my Wii U copy and this is my first attempt at a legit 100%. I have a map of all stuff and I'm going per region before going for the Divine Beasts, anything I should be mindful of?"
