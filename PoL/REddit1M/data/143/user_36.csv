545875,"amiibo cards are fanmade cards for any non-Animal Crossing amiibo, using NFC stickers mimicking the amiibo's programming. They work just like amiibo, and you can get them pre-made cheaper than the amiibo themselves would cost. You can even make them yourself, but that can get tricky if you don't know what you are doing."
