563237,"Hard mode assumes that you are already *very* familiar with the combat system, how to conserve and most efficiently use your equipment, and when to pick your battles, none of which are immediately obvious to a new player. Normal mode will teach you those things fairly effectively, while hard mode will just kill you offhandedly for not knowing them, so my recommendation would be to play normal mode first, at least until you have a grasp on those concepts.

The challenge *will* diminish over time... because this is a video game, and that's a thing that happens when people get more skilled at video games. In no way does this even *vaguely resemble* a problem."
