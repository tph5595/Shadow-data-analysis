349950,"I found Kass on a giant mushroom at Washa's Bluff. How do I climb this? I slip near the top area. I could climb up the smaller mushroom underneath it though.  
I do know there's a champion's power that gives you a really high jump, that's the only way?  
  
edit: I feel stupid now. Climbed it without a problem. I definitely slipped several times before for no apparent reason though..."

You sure about climbing? I tried it with plenty of stamina but Link always just slips at the top bit."
