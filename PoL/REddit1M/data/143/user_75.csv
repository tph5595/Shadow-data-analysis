I've looked for updates, and it even downloaded some stuff, but no matter how much i restart the game, the console and reinsert the game cartridge, nothing happens! I assume that if i have the dlc, i will have the option to play master difficulty at the title screen, but theres nothing there, i cant enter the master trials either."

293392,"Yeah, it leads me to the nintendo store and says its purchased. Maybe i need to contact nintendo support..."
