61559,"&gt; When you have Daruk's Protection activated you can no longer focus behind instead just activate the protection.

I have Daruk's Protection enabled and I can use ZL to center the camera behind Link any time."
61715,Those items are still permanently lost once you drain your Hyrule of them. Chests don't respawn unless they're on Eventide
61847,"- There's an upper path where no enemies can see you
- The Yiga will investigate any nearby sound or any banana they see
- You don't need to kill them to pass the room"
112017,It's probably going to release simultaneously worldwide
184007,"&gt; Where am I supposed to go after the great plateau?

The old man told you to go to Kakariko by following the road past the dueling peaks. Check your adventure log"
185408,Do you mean the Champion abilities' voice clips? That's a bug with changing the game language. The only fix currently is to change the language back to default and close the software
186768,"If you've changed the language back to default and reset your Switch and gone back into the game without changing the language from default, and the Champion ability voice clips still don't play, then I'm not sure how you'd fix it. That solution works for every other case of this that I've heard of"
187593,No problem my man
200251,"Unequip it from the menu, like you would with equipment

Keep in mind the person you replied to is incorrect about Daruk's Protection disabling the use of ZL to center the camera"
205244,"Just look around very carefully for targets.

Click on the seed's icon [here](https://www.zeldadungeon.net/breath-of-the-wild-interactive-map/) for the solution"
225350,"Either it was a wooden chest you broke, or when you opened it your inventory was full and you didn't notice which left the loot unclaimed, or you loaded a save from before you opened the chest at some point, or you discovered a new glitch"
241007,Do you mean saving in the Trial of the Sword? If you could do that it would remove most of the challenge
245079,Nope
280226,I think he's asking about in a new save file. The answer seems to be when you discover your first stable
292227,"If you're on Switch press + on BotW in your home screen, and see if it's at version 1.3.0"
292935,"It should be.

Select ""DLC Purchased"" on the title screen. Does it show that you own the Pack 1 content?"
293694,"The title screen option in-game shouldn't lead you to the eShop if you've already purchased it. It should say ""DLC Purchased"" and list all the benefits of Pack 1.

Go to System Settings -&gt; Data Mangement -&gt; Manage Software -&gt; BotW -&gt; Delete Software (won't delete save data, don't worry). Then redownload"
295093,No problem my man
296342,"&gt; where are the chests in the great plateau that come with dlc?

- Nintendo Switch Shirt - near Ja Baij Shrine
- Bomb Arrow x5 - near Keh Namut Shrine
- Ruby - near Oman Au Shrine

&gt; is miphas grace missing from anyones screen now?

That shouldn't happen unless you unequipped it from your inventory."
327345,"That's just up to the player to try parrying different things.

""Oh, it works on all melee attacks, cool""

""Oh, when you parry certain projectiles, they get reflected back""

*encounters an enemy that fires a devastating projectile*

""Hmm""

And of course, before the player has puzzled this out, Guardians are meant to be very tough."
369342,"If you have the expansion pass, do the quest called ""EX Treasure: Ancient Mask."""
369383,There are no new weapons.
369821,"DLC Pack 2 *might* have new enemies, but I have a feeling they wouldn't be added around Hyrule, just exclusive to whatever areas are new to Pack 2. All speculation, though"
417011,Find one that's positioned where it won't spit the weapon into lava
417117,"It combines the effects of all four Kilton masks. As long as you don't attack, Link will blend in with all Bokoblins, Moblins, and Lizalfos. Lynels will also not attack you for a minute."
461506,"Only Rock Octoroks, which inhale before attacking."
462976,Yes
462994,You can. We don't know all their locations yet
463156,"&gt; has anyone used the Champion's Tunic on a Gold Lionel?

Gold Lynels have 7500 HP"
463289,"It's taken away from you when you leave the trial, however"
463427,"There are no material drops from monsters in Trial of the Sword anyway, and it's much more worth it to avoid any risk of damage from the first Lynel than to get its gear. The second Lynel's gear is absolutely pointless because it's on the final floor"
463961,[Yup](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/6kuxel/red_bokoblin_in_master_mode_i_also_found_a/)

- Final Trials: 23 floors including 3 rest areas"
466778,"The only required fights are the Blight Ganons and Calamity Ganon. See [any video here](http://www.speedrun.com/botw#Any)

The upgraded Master Sword can run out of energy but has very high durability."
535252,"Same as Silver Lynels, AFAIK"
537649,"When you get to the ground after first activating the tower, the Old Man calls out to Link before gliding down. Maybe you heard the Old Man?"
537799,Maybe one of your Champion abilities recharged and you thought the voice clip was Link?
574451,Untrue. See [any video here](http://www.speedrun.com/botw#Any)
