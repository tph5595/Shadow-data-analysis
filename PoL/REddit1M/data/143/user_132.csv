585260,"I've beaten the game, but I am so incredibly far from 100%. I have 63 shrines, about 80 Koroks, and tons of quests to complete. I'm trying to do as much as I can without a guide.

And now the DLC is here. I truly don't know if I should focus on my regular file and continue to work towards my quest to 100% (especially now that the Korok Mask is out there somewhere) or if I should restart and try Master Mode.

Decisions, Decisions..."
