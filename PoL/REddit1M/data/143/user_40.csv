There's some direct references to cross dimension stuff and things that are consistent throughout each timeline show up in this game. So either that, or Nintendo is more obviously than ever not trying to make a timeline.

I like the possibility of this game being a fresh start for time linearity for future games. They have the biggest and best canvas to work off of. "
