263904,"Yup. Most non-stealth games have no idea how to punish the player during stealth portions. Stealth is really neat in the trial of the sword, but the Yiga clan hideout feels out of place. Worst part of the game imo. "
264313,"Do you own the DLC?  If so, make sure you update your game. There's an option on the main menu for Master Mode. "
264795,"The beautiful part of this game is that you can go wherever you want. Hell, you could go fight the last boss RIGHT NOW if you wanted to.  You'd probably die, but it's there. As the others are saying, I'd recommend following the main quest to Kakariko village. I would also recommend following the main quest till you get the Camera rune, since there is a catalog you can fill out with it. Not essential, but it's good to have it early if you're a completionist."
264925,"You do have to restart the game to play hard mode, HOWEVER the game has a separate Hard Mode save, so you don't need to delete your previous one. "
265010,"The game has a list of DLC content in your game.  It also gives you quests for the new gear when you launch it. If they don't show up, start an update for your game. "
265082,"Give us some time!  Hard modes only been out for like, less than 12 hours. 
That being said, it probably is. And I'm excited to find out. "
265131,"Master Mode is its own save file separate from your main file. If you launched the game in Master Mode, that's probably why. "
265196,"As soon as it's downloaded. Just start a software update. As soon as you launch the game, there are quests for it. "
266363,"True, but they'd have to finish that boss rush first. It's possible, but I'd say it's still a little early for that. "
516503,"Good luck man. 
I'd like to think that I'm good at video games, (thanks to all the time I've put into Dark Souls) but dang. Hard mode is really REALLY hard. "
