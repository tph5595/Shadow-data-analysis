441324,In the middle trials underground floor 13  there's a chest on top of the tall square divider (I know this due to my shieka slate). Does anyone know how to get up there?
443862,I used 5 bundles of wood set on fire to create an updraft. Turns out the chest is inside the block thing and impossible to get to.
