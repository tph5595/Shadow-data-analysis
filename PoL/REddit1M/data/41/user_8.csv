1849,"Yep maxing out stamina is much more essential than adding 3 hearts. The difference each stamina upgrade makes in allowing you to scale mountains or such is invaluable imo

"
2028,"I beat the game a couple days ago but deleted my save file impulsively, I'm thinking of doing a naked run (no armor) or a limited heart run (armor ok but no heart upgrades), what do you recommend? "
2565,"1. Yep you can flurry rush pretty much any enemy in the game. Don't want to give spoilers but there's only one enemy type that you do not want to flurry rush on, but still every enemy is capable of being flurry rushed. 

2. Yep, you can do it with spears or heavy weapons

3. Nope, I've done flurry rushes with just a sword and no shield

You could probably practice on Bokoblin camps in a 1v1 and aim at getting a last minute dodge. Later on you'll come across common big enemies that have very slow windup swings that you can practice on perfectly. "
7948,"Yeah I'll probably be doing a naked run now, it'll be difficult but I'm sure it'll be entertaining relying on potions to survive places like Death mountain or the frigid cold lol 

Thanks everyone!"
