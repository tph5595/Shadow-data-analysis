7376,"I just unlocked my first memory last night, the one where she comes down from mt. Lanyru. I got advice for where to go from the guy in Kakariko who wants to find the fairy fountain. So I feel like, since that's a quest, it was kind of planned for me to find that first. Will they all be like that or do I just have to find them myself from now on? Because if it's the way the quests intended, I'll just do them since the game designers had a plan in mind. Some stories don't have flashbacks in order and the story still makes sense. But if I have to find them on my own, I kinda want to do them in order. So I should find out what that order is (also there's 18 memories but only 12 pics so will I unlock more later?)

Lots of questions, thanks for any help"
