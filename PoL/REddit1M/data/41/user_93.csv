32666,"The arrow ""glitch"" doesn't work for me. :( When enemies shoot at me they just disappear most of the time. I'll maybe get like five out of one enemy. Can't figure out how to make it work. 


Also anyone know how to make high-level elixirs? I can only get low and I can't figure out what the ratio of critters vs. monster parts is supposed to be. "
