29367,"I was in gerudo valley and wasn't taking heat damage and thought it was a bug but later realized it was I had a frost sword equipped. 

edit: I now carry around a frost and flame sword for use in hot/cold weather. I assume I will get more stuff in the future to help mitigate the heat differences. I'm ""only"" around 35 hours in."
