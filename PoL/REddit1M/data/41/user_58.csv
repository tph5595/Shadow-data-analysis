17405,"I'm not quite that far into the game in terms of hours, roughly 30-40. (PS. if anyone could tell me how to check hours on the wii u that'd be great) But I'm struggling to stay playing due to difficulty. I have terrible gear constantly, run out of arrows quickly, just feel as though I can't grind anything. (strangely enough I actually love grinding for gear and levels in video games) I've defeated the second divine beast dungeon. Anybody have any tips on where to go next or how I can farm gear?"
32825,I actually do have the armour! Though I always forget to equip as I keep equipping the gerudo set for.... reasons.
