64384,"so, question. I wanna play BOTW but have neither a Wuu nor a switch and can't think of any other games on either platform i want. is shelling out 2/3rds of the price of a switch for a refurbished wuu going to be as painful of a mistake for me as cheaping out and going for a old 3DS in lieu of a new one was? All that got me was awful lag in Pokemon Sun. Gut feeling tells me the switch is going to last me longer in the long run since the wuu is on the way out."
