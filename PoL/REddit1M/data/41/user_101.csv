39318,"My wife's game seems to spawn tons of Yiga clan members. It's not uncommon for her to encounter 5 of the large Yiga guys(wind cleaver ones) in a single play 2 hour through. On the other hand, I have never encountered one of those guys in my game. I'm further in the game than she is as well.

Is it normal for that many Yiga to spawn?"
40574,Both of us have. The only difference I see is that she follows the roads way more than I do.
43355,I'm wondering if they mostly spawn on roads!
