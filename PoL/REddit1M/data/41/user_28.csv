8289,"I'll go in the opposite direction and say that I max out hearts instead of stamina.

Two reasons:

1) I can't stand one row of 15 and another row of 12. They should be even (come on Nintendo!). I only see the stamina wheel(s) when I run/climb/swim, I see the hearts constantly, so aesthetically, I prefer all hearts.

2) When climbing, there are typically enough flat spots (or flat enough to cheese) to regain stamina. For the really tall mountains or whatnot, I will use (light spoiler) [Revali's Gale](/spoiler) to help."

[It's in Hateno Village. Warp to the Myam Aghana shrine and walk across the bridge. Talk to Bolson and he will ask for 50,000 rupees, then he will drop it to 3,000 rupees + 30 bundles of wood. Bring him the goods and you'll get to buy the house. Talk to Bolson again and he will offer to build furniture, signs, mounts, etc for the house, for 100 rupees each. It takes 1,800 rupees for all upgrades. You will have 3 weapon mounts, 3 sheild mounts, and 3 bow mounts.](/spoiler)"

If you have an ancient shield, you can parry by just pressing L, you don't have to hit A to parry."
