21068,I am really having a tough time finding Giant Ancient Cores. I have raided every Shrine and it is still not enough. I have been fighting Guardians in large numbers and no sign of them. Are there any chest locations that have the G.Ancient Cores?
24406,Every blood moon? Does that make much of a difference?
