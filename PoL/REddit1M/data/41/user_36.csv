9966,All the stability you could ever handle (until the next update that is).
10342,"I've heard that some people are saying they have frame rate improvements, but I'm suspicious whether that's just a placebo effect taking place."
11288,"Which ""small"" guardian are you taking a picture of?"
13481,"It really depends on how ""good"" you are at the game. Can you flurry rush consistently? Can you deflect guardian lasers every time? Until you've got the basics of those flowing pretty well, Hyrule Castle will be pretty difficult to get through. Of course, I didn't have either of those perfected when I went to face Calamity Ganon. I literally climbed around everything and avoided most of the guardians and both the lynels and went and faced Calamity Ganon. It's doable."
13549,"No traditional dungeons, yes. Hyrule Castle is the closest thing to the old dungeons."
14122,"Nope, you can deflect guardian lasers with anything from the pot lid to a guardian shield. For practice I would suggest going into Hyrule field with Daruk's protection activated. Find a guardian and let them get close to the point where they stop coming closer. When they get their laser ready to fire up you're going to want to hit A as soon as their eye flashes white, literally a split second before the laser fires. It will take some practice and you will probably run through a lot of shields, but once you find the sweet spot for reflecting lasers you will only ever need one shield again."
14194,Which specific games do you want to play?
14223,"If you've beaten Ganon, then your percentage should be on your map in the bottom left. Does your save file show a star next to it?"
14377,Well different games will need different emulators. If you want to play a 3D Zelda game like Wind Waker then you probably want the Dolphin Gamecube emulator.
14577,There are no indestructible shields in the game. The [Hylian Shield](/spoiler) found [in the basement of Hyrule Castle](/spoiler) is pretty much indestructible as it lasts an extremely long time. When it breaks you will be able to purchase it from [a man in Tarrey Town](/spoiler).
14599,"Not sure, maybe you could test it out!"
14685,"Dolphin is also a Wii emulator! I believe you will need a USB sensor bar to play Skyward Sword, though. /r/DolphinEmulator should have all the info you need on that."
14755,"Nope, the max hearts you can have is 30, no extra."
15085,Did you load the save file that had the star?
15203,There is no post-Ganon game play. When you go to load the game again you will see a save file with a star next to it that places you right outside the room where you fight Ganon. The star means you have beaten the game.
18637,"There should be an app on the WiiU called ""Activity Log"" which should show how many hours you've put into BOTW. As for farming gear, have you been completing the combat shrines? Beating the guardians of those shrines usually nets you a few good weapons. As for arrows, the struggle is real. Whenever I run into Beedle or any vendor I always buy all their arrows."
18801,I believe the best defensive armor is the armor you purchase at [The Ancient Lab](/spoiler) in [Akkala](/spoiler).
18839,"Good to know! I won't get my hopes up for when I get home then, haha."
18947,I would try that. Once you load into that save file every auto-save and manual save after that should have the star and all the perks that come with beating the game.
18986,Hold ZL and move the left control stick.
24784,It has to be the ones that suck in before they shoot something at you. I believe these only appear near Death Mountain.
30676,Visit Rito Village.
87002,It has good defensive stats in general as well as good resistance against guardian lasers.
135625,Good to know!
