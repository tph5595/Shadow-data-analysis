886,Is it possible to get two Hylian shields at once? One from the Zelda amiibo and the other one from hyrule castle? I would like to hang one up in my house
1447,"You cannot max out both hearts and stamina wheels. If you max out stamina (3 wheels) you will be short 3 hearts. Likewise, you can compromise or have maximum hearts and 2.25 stamina wheels. Looks like they left some room here for later DLC that will allow you to max out both (or so I hope). 

I don't want to potential spoil anything but there is some big incentive to invest in hearts until you have 13 and then focus on catching up with stamina upgrades. Other than that, the method I use and what seems to be pretty popular is to do ""heart, heart, stamina"" and then repeat. So basically 1 stamina upgrade per two heart upgrades if that makes sense"
2495,"You can flurry rush any opponent, even if you have a two handed weapon, and you do not need a shield. With the stab attacks, you need to dodge by side stepping in order to get it. Basically you just need to dodge perpendicular to their attack"
2593,"You can flurry rush bosses and mini bosses, may not be the most efficient way to fight them in some cases though"
2930,"It's tricky to get down at first, also you need to get good at parrying attacks with your shield (hold up your shield and press ""A"" right before they hit you). If you want to get in some good practice, find a group of enemies you feel confident with and save the game. Go in and fight them then reload the game and repeat. This way you can practice as much as you want without actually losing any gear"
4297,Yeah the better horses just take longer to soothe which requires more stamina. Easiest way to do it is cook some food that gives temporary stamina wheels or eat stamina recovering food while soothing the horse
4456,Parry power. Shields with higher parry power do more damage when you parry an attackers moves
9679,Oh ok thanks I thought they were 1/4 of a wheel
9736,Sorry if I spoiled it for you!!
