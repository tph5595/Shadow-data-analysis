29422,"I visited the Great Fairy Fountain in Dueling Peaks for the first time and noticed a stump with an orange glow. It looked like a ball needs to be placed in it to turn blue. I haven't found a way to activate the stump. Any ideas? 

Here is the pic of the stump and the location on the map: http://imgur.com/5ACUSk4

56459,What's he best way to talk to the gossiping villagers Amira and Nikki in Hateno village? I've been sneaking up on them from behind and using stealth potions and then pressing A to talk them but I've had no luck so far. I think I'm doing something wrong.
