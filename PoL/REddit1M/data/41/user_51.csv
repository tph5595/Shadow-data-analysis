Other than that, you just have to find replacements. Perusing through Hyrule Castle will get you lots of really nice equipment."

There are some ways to find them in the wild (certain enemies, some crates) but mostly you'll get them from quests and mini games. You can also get quite a lot from selling items that you find, specifically ores that you come across. Some of them will be used to upgrade armor later on, though, so just be aware of what you're selling."
