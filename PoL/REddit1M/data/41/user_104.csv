43677,I had one spawn at the very top of the mountain range between Necluda and Faron.
44359,"The only memory I have yet to recall is the one at Hyrule Castle. Questions:

- Is there a reward from Impa for unlocking all twelve memories that would make it worth going into the dungeon, finding the recall spot, warping out to complete the quest, and doing however much of the Castle all over again?
- Is there a fast travel location anywhere in the castle area? I made it to the gate once, saw there was no warp point, and noped out.
    - If there is one, is it close enough to the memory spot to make it worth activating on the same incursion, before I actually go in to beat Ganon?
- Is there anyone, maybe a Pikango instance somewhere, that gives me a clue as to where on the castle grounds this is? I don't fancy wasting a bunch of healing items on a non-endgame mission.

Thanks!

92516,"Thank you, and to everyone else who replied. I successfully got the memory this morning, shortly after wasting my first Ancient Arrow of the entire playthrough to take care of a white Lynel in a gatehouse.

I was going to explore the castle more, but I saw the silver Moblin near the memory spot and noped out, as I was down to one shield due to the blasted Guardian Turrets. Then my plan was to finish the memory quest, cook up some Hearty stuff, grab some shields, and head back for the endgame, but there was a fricking Blood Moon that happened out of nowhere while I was in the field with the final memory, so now I can look forward to killing six or seven turrets for a second time. I at least hope the Malice patches I got rid of don't return."
92681,"My map-reading skills suck. I had tried to deduce it as you suggested before I posted the question, and I tried again after you posted, but I  guess was looking for too specific a feature, rather than just looking for the biggest octagonal (or was it hexagonal) tower I could see. Yet I did find the memory eventually, full report [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/61z8ws/botw_daily_questions_thread_ask_questions_and_get/dfk6vqk/). Thanks for your help!"
92827,"&gt; I wouldn't worry about having to re-do the castle.

My main worry was about all the Guardians respawning, which I am in fact going to have to deal with, as there was a Blood Moon almost the moment I left the castle grounds. I at least hope the destructible Malice pools that I took care of don't respawn.

Full report [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/61z8ws/botw_daily_questions_thread_ask_questions_and_get/dfk6vqk/), thanks for the help!"
94987,"Yeah, I've talked to both of them. Before five minutes ago I wasn't interested in sneaky stealthy ways to enter the main part of the castle / confront Ganon, since I intend to scour the entire area, but five minutes ago I learned that the Hylian Shield has 25Ã— the durability of the next strongest shield, so now I am kind of interested in sneaking in until I have it. Didn't the Woodland guy say that the best way for equipment is the docks on the north side of the castle? I'll be checking that before my next incursion."
96053,I don't want to bypass the enemies on my way to the top. :) I want to scour the entire area so I can run around freely before the final boss. I'm just miffed that I'm going to have to scour parts of it *twice* since I had to kill a few of them the first time.
