28552,What gear do I need to survive the cold to go snowling? I have the warm doublet but I'm still taking damage from the cold. 
44846,I'm the same way. I have max bond w/ Epona and turning is really sketchy. Especially when I'm riding fast and there's a cliff or rocks coming up. 
45618,I read that you're stuck after beating him. No post game gameplay. 
45923,Should I keep all of my ores for upgrading or sell them? I'm still pretty early in the game. I've sunken around 15 hours into the game but most of it has been from exploring. 
53709,I have close to 4k roupees rn but I was gonna sell the ore for a house. Lol.
