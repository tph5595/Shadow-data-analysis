18953,This can't be the whole explanation...I had silver lynels before I ever killed a Lynel 
21972,Nope I've done 3 dungeons and almost 100 shrines though
30465,"is that near Kakariko village? if so, you'll need to visit Impa :)"
37152,"people will say it's based on how many of a particular enemy you kill, but I don't believe that. Lynels upgraded to silver in my game before I ever killed one, and Moblins are silver for me even though I generally avoid them"
37196,you want to find enemies on horseback that keep moving. IIUC enemies who stay stationary have a 5 arrow limit
