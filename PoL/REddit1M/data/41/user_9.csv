1854,"I've advanced past Great Plateau and am just now discovering the Flurry Rush attack move. I want to practice this move but have some questions. I was trying to practice on a green Lizalfo that had a spear and I couldn't get the flurry rush attack to work. I was trying to dodge back (backflip) but it didn't want to go into slow-motion. Maybe I should have been dodging to the side? (since it's a spear he's lunging at me)

 1) Can you Flurry Rush attack any enemy (such as the Lizalfo)?

 2) Can you Flurry Rush if you're holding a 2-handed weapon?

 3) Do you need to have a shield armed to Flurry Rush?

Any help on where I should go to practice would be appreciated. "
2694,"Thanks! So I must have been too far back and not side stepping the spear attack. I keep breaking shields when I practice, should I just keep hunting for for shields? Using shields rated 3-10 (still early in the game)"
3483,"I was trying last night against a big Moblin north of Kakariko Village that had a big club and I couldn't get the Flurry Rush to work. With those red Moblin's that use the black club, do you jump backwards to Flurry Rush?"
4052,"That's a good idea in regards to the save point. I think I'm going to do that and practice. I'm actually pretty good with the shield parry, I've practiced it on Guardians several times with success. My problem is I end up running through shields but your method would prevent that. "
23727,"I heard you can throw rusty weapons at Octoroks and they will return them in new condition. I've tried a bunch of times to throw a rusty weapon towards an Octorok that's in water and nothing seems to happen. Can you do this trick with Octoroks in water, or is it only the land ones (where you can lay the weapon down)? Just not sure if it's because I'm not close enough or not throwing the weapon far enough.. "
25099,"That explains it, thanks. I must have lost like 10 weapons trying to throw at the lake Octorok and then I could never get the weapon back."
25248,"Am I the only one that never uses a horse?

I just find them to be a pain, I'm not very far along and haven't even bothered to register any at a stable.. I just take them when I see them. Are the horses a vital part of the game or sort of an add on? Other than going fast (you can teleport so many places) what are they useful for and do you guys usually bring them everywhere?"
