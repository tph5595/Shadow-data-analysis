1133,"Yes the enemies scale, and the loot they carry scale with them. This is dependent on how many of those enemies you've killed. "
1216,You can't max out both even after all the shrines. You'll always be 3 upgrades from maxing both. It's 30 hearts max or 3 stamina wheels.
5735,Yeah definitely max out stamina. You can always fill those three missing hearts with food. With max stamina you can still get a bonus yellow stamina wheel. 
24940,There are certain locations where a specific tier of enemy will always spawn there. 
28238,"If you like teleporting to places then that's fine. Just so you know, once you get a horse to max bond you can literally let go of your left stick and they'll follow the roads. It's actually pretty fun just looking at the scenery for long stretches of road. "
28294,"Find a slower horse? And once you get a horse to max bond, they're easy to control and even follow roads. Just feed t about a dozen apples and they'll be max bond in no time. "
28384,"Yes, some areas have perpetual rain until you finish a quest or event. Some areas rain a ton more than others (e.g. rainforests). Wizzrobes cause rain. So if you find it raining a lot, maybe there is a wizzrobe nearby. "
28431,You have to be stopped first though
28485,I fought him naked and he's still a joke. 
28567,You mean Yiga henchmen? Gerudo is a race
28682,You have to load the one that has a star. That's the one that will have the % on the bottom left of your map screen. 
29344,Hopefully hard mode will be challenging
30876,"A lot of people don't like teleporting because of immersion. Everyone plays how they like. Personally, I think BotW horses are the best video game horses since Red Dead Redemption. "
84612,If you have a certain amount of arrows in your inventory (I think it's around 80-100 or so) they won't restock until you have fewer. 
84746,Eldin region is hotter than hot. You need fireproof. There's a girl at Foothill Stable that can help you out
84981,"Unlocking all 12 memories and going back to Impa will give you access to an extra memory. If you have all these memories unlocked when you beat the game, you get a bonus cutscene. 

There is a shrine somewhere in the castle. One guy at a stable hints at where it is, and it happens to be a good way to enter the castle. (There are tons of ways to enter the castle) 

I believe Pikango at Lurelin village gives you that memory hint, but I don't remember it being all that helpful. "
85082,Yeah moblins cause fps drops. Kinda annoying. 
85142,In general they upgrade as you kill more. But certain locations already have stronger enemies from the start. 
85229,You can find him running around again during the day. It's actually a small sidequest that gives you access to [respecing your hearts and stamina upgrades](/spoilers)
92745,"If you want other ways to enter the castle, I suggest talking to the girl at Riverside Stable. She gives the best tips in my opinion. There's also a guy at Woodland Stable that tells you a good route. Good luck storming the castle! "
123794,I haven't had the elementals not restock yet so afaik it's specific for each type.
