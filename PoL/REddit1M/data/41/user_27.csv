You can use the statue to swap heart and stamina containers back and forth as much as you like."
8437,There's more shield surfing (and another surfing npc and mini game) in the Hebra mountains.
8642,"You can parry the blasts with any shield (which will send them back at the guardian), you just have to time it right.

The ancient shield can reflect the beams without you having to parry, but it WILL still eat the durability of the shield pretty quickly.. You can kill a handful of guardians before it breaks... maybe 15 eyebeams? 

If you want even more parts though, once you get comfortable with the walking guardians, if you kill each of the legs before killing the body, each leg will drop 1-2 extra ancient parts, so it basically *doubles* your loot from each walking guardian."
9197,"Someone posted a screenshot of that, that they found a ""Silver Lizard"" that was super rare (and apparently not in the compendium) that would make non slip elixirs, but it was a hoax.

I wish it was real.


EDIT:  [Found it.](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/5zmhh6/botwspoilers_i_did_not_know_this_existed_cant/)  Confirmed hoax. Updated my post."
9531,Yup.
14541,"I'd say make sure to finish the memories before going for the kill, but otherwise you can do it whenever you feel you're strong enough.  Some lynel practice will probably be in order, but if you're having a really hard time there is an easy way to cheese them.

21226,"[There are](https://www.reddit.com/r/Breath_of_the_Wild/comments/613mup/giant_ancient_core_locations/)

But if you've exhausted all the free ones in chests, you're pretty much limited to slaughtering guardians every blood moon."
21554,"Fully upgraded, the Soldiers Set, Ancient Set, and Wild Set all have 28 defense per piece, which is the best you can find in a set .  Since the Soldiers set and Wild set have no (or worse) set bonus than Ancient, Ancient has the edge as the best armor set.

You can add to that the Champion's Tunic, which has a defense of 32 fully upgraded, and is the highest armor in the game, I believe, but you give up your set bonus."
