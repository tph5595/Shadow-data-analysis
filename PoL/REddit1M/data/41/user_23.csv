7142,"I'm having trouble scanning in amiibos. I tried it the first time with my villager amiibos a few days ago and it gave me a few items. I tried to use him again the next day, along with Rover and Rider Link, but Link just holds out his sheikah plate and nothing happens. 

The amiibo is scanning correctly when I try to change owners and whatnot in the settings page. Am i doing something wrong on BOTW? "

97330,"yeah, i was sure i was in amiibo mode. 
i tried it again, and it was because i wasn't on a flat surface. i was also doing a one of the trials in the korok forest and it wouldn't work anywhere at the entrance, so i left the trial and tried again. "
