6280,Practice parrying Guardian lasers and farm them in Central Hyrule Field.
8182,"Any shield can Parry them - I typically use a Pot Lid because it has pretty high durability, just low stopping power.  The timing is tricky to get down and you can use reloads to keep trying.

They lock on and beep slowly, then beep quickly, then a more distinct chirp right before they shoot.  You have to wait a split second after the chirp and hit parry when locked on and you'll reflect the beam.  I hear the chirp, then immediately sound *chirp* in my head, then hit the button and it works for me.

You'll have more ancient parts than you'll know what to do with by getting this timing down!"
8705,"The farther in you get, the more weapons you'll find just everywhere.  

To the point where you'll start throwing some away if you don't smack enough stuff and break them in order to keep up.

I don't have great advice now other than it gets a lot better so scrounge what you can now and push on.
