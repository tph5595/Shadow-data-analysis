9044,Anyone know what was in the update?
10173,Does it help with frame rates?
10468,Probably placebo like how people said rebooting your switch with the joycons attached after the day 1 update fixed the left joycon issue. I'll go to korok forest and see if it feels any better to me.
17703,Zelda got a patch today at least on the switch version.
18653,I still have frame rate issues
19298,I second this. It makes ganon a joke of a fight.
28743,"I definitely over prepared. I had the ancient armor and I think all the pieces were rank 2 or 3 at the time, I had the master sword, plus 3 attack food, and like 18-20 hearts. Pwned that noob.

Edit: also I did all dungeons so they did their thing to make the fight shorter."
