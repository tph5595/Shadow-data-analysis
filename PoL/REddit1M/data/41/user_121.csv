You can always raid a Bokoblin encampment. They will have decent stuff. You're probably not ready to handle Hinox or Lynel yet.

You're about at the point where you'll find reinforced weapons; weapons that have a longer lifespan. Cherish these weapons. Always burn through your weaker weapons first."
