32724,"For walkers, just go for the kill. While I shield parry the stationary guardians, as it's a one shot kill, walkers take 3 shots, and you can take them down faster/safer than in 3 parries.

If I'm caught in the open on foot, I'll parry the first beam, use the time to run in, chop off legs, then stasis+ to disrupt the second beam, chop off more legs, and repeat until dead.

If I'm caught in the open on horseback, I'll charge in and circle strafe it to death while on horseback, no special moves, unless it somehow locks in an eye beam, in which case I'll do the slow motion arrow to the eye thing.

Not only does chopping legs result in more drops, it's safer too, as you get really good at timing your stasis+ so that the guardians never get a shot off."

Ice Keese, go to Snowfield stable located northeast of Rito, mount up, and ride around the snowfields. You run into them in the open, but there's a bunch in one of the skulls too.

Warm Saffina, go to Gerudo, there's a set of ruins north of the city. You'll find all the Warm Saffina you need there. You'll run into more Electric Keese too, if the Zora trail cave didn't have enough.

Can you tell I recently farmed the exact same items?"
