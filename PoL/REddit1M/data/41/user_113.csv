62234,"I'm on my last beast which is in eldin.  I'm wearing the desert voe set and have Lvl 2 heat resistance.  My equipped weapons are knights bow, master sword, and daybreaker shield.  I paraglide off of the eldin tower and immediately start to burn once i hit the ground.  Still says I have lvl 2 heat resist.  I've popped elixirs and heat resist food.  Still on fire.  I check my inventory and see no weapons on fire.  

Any ideas what I'm doing wrong?"
63047,You need fireproof elixirs... in case anyone else runs into this problem.
