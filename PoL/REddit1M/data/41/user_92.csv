32189,Get armor and upgrade it ASAP. The Hylian set can be purchased for a few hundred rupees and upgraded to the 1st level with like 15 bokoblin horns. Armor is simply linear so upgrading it is a super effective way of reducing the damage you take (so if you have 15 armor you will take 3.75 hearts less damage *on every hit* compared to being naked). I didn't appreciate this the first time through and combat was a lot harder for me for a while than it had to be.
