573,"How many Heart Container / Stamina Container upgrades can be applied? Is it possible to max out both if you get all of the shrines? 

I've only done 8-10 upgrades so far and beaten one divine beast, and I've been favoring heart upgrades so far (maybe 2 to 1 over stamina), but I'm starting to wonder if I should alternate every other upgrade. Is there an optimal strategy?"
