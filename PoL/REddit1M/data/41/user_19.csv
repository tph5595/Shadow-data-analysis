6373,Amiibos are special collector figurines. Do you have any of those?
9410,"One of the 18 memories is unlocked once you have gotten all of the 12, the other 5 are found by doing other things in the game.

There is no real prescribed order to do them in. You can find the painter at stables around the map, and he will give you hints, but not in any particular order.

The order you see them doesn't really matter, and you can rewatch them in order later for the full experience. The chronological order is the order they appear (left to right, top to bottom) in your album."
40087,"Have you both infiltrated the Yiga Clan HQ, or just her?"
43067,"Odd that you haven't encountered any, since they're supposed to start harrassing you after you defeat their leader."
48164,There's a good sidequest line that comes after you buy the house in Hateno. Have you done that yet?
48228,Your user profile has a section on the game. It won't show your total time until after you've owned the game for some number of days. 
48380,"The memory location is pretty near the edge of the castle. You can access it pretty easily without going inside - though you be in the castle map.

There is somewhere inside the castle to fast travel. It's not near the memory. 

I don't know of any NPC hints, but you can figure out where it's at from a close look at the map."
48456,"That is one of the framerate drop issues that a lot of people have reported. It's not a problem with your wii u, it's with the BotW software."
49724,"They are useful for something, but getting ores is really easy in the mid-late game. If you need money for arrows, armor, or sidequests I would comfortably sell them."
