13099,"Ok, I've played the entire game spoiler free to this point. I haven't looked up anything. I've finished the divine beasts, I lack 2 memories, and impa now tells me to go to the castle and confront clamity ganon. So I went. I got to the second gatehouse and the lynel fucked me up. 

Without spoiling anything can anyone tell me how close I am to finishing and what the recommended number of hearts and equipment upgrades are for getting through the castle?

EDIT: Thanks for the help everyone. I now have some direction to either finish the game or prolong this play through. Much appreciated. "
13660,I can flurry rush ok. Didn't manage many against either lynel in the castle. I can't deflect the guardian lasers. Is that only doable with guardian shields?
14274,I know one is in the castle from the painter guy. I should be able to find that one ok. I have no idea about the woods one though. Can you give me a cardinal direction on that one so I can search for it?
