11063,"I'm having a lot of trouble with the Shrine quest where you need to show someone three pictures of guardians (small one, big one, flying one). I have all three pictures (they show up with red ""!"" on them in my album) and I've taken them twice actually (ensuring they were all fully in the shot and pretty center), but whenever I talk to the person who gave me the quest, they just give the same generic dialogue and act like I don't have all three pictures. Is this bugged? Am I doing something wrong?"
16906,I'm an idiot. I was missing a picture of the normal Guardian...
