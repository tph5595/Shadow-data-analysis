89410,"So to recap the bosses from Link to the Past:

Armos Knight: You just smack it around. Sand Worm: You just smack it around. 

Worm from Death Mountain: You just smack it in its glowing weak spot tail (think he criticized about Ocarina appearing in game he's worshipping! Bonus point!), 

Agahnim: You hit his attack back at him. Not bad. 

Helmasaur: You use the item you got in the dungeon on it. Eyeball squid: You use the item from that dungeon on it. 

Moth thing: You use the item from the dungeon to kill it. Or you just smack it around. 

Blind: You just smack him around. Ice Eyeball thing: You get a crappy item in this dungeon, so they just copout and have you use the last dungeon's item. 

Yet Another Eyeball Enemy: You just smack it around. Three HEaded Thing: Attack fire head with ice, ice head with fire. Legitimate mechanics. Yay? Then you smack it around.

He's really not got a leg to stand on on almost any of his complaints. He has one or two valid points but between his mindless Skyward Sword bashing and his nonsense points, it's buried. 

What it boils down to is he's nostalgic for simple games with no real complicated mechanics because he's, bluntly, stupid. And can't handle games that require real thought or skill."
108673,"&gt;His point was that the bosses in aLttP were challenging because a lot of the time you didn't know what to do.

You hit it with your sword, that's  the solution almost all the time.  None of the bosses in Link to the Past require any thought. All of them are super obvious and most of them just require ""hit it with your sword"". If you're bad at games... well you get better.  

There's nothing not formulaic about anything in Link to the past. I'd rather have a boss that uses the item than one I can just fucksmack until I win. 

Darklink, Twinrova, Ganon, Ganondorf, and Phantom Ganon were all most interesting than anything in Link to the Past.

And the fact that Ego constantly knocks Skyward Sword is more telling that he doesn't know what he wants because that's the only Zelda game I've played that had any real puzzles that were actual puzzles, and really legitimately challenging fights."
108864,"Skyward Sword was the best game in the series, I think. It actually had challenge, character development (something the series has **always** lacked, except maybe Majora's) and puzzles. "
108911,"Because ""where the fuck do I go"" is only fun in your memories."
108938,"Ocarina of Time felt more open than Link to the Past. Link to the Past wasn't REALLY open, most of the areas were mandatory."
109000,"I like how he talks about ""waiting"" too.

None of those enemies actually require much waiting if you're any good, except the clam. If you don't know how to get around a Wolfos without swinging into its guard 50 times, maybe you're just bad."
113853,"&gt; But in all honesty, when I read your comments is that you've never played a LttP, 

I played it around the same time I played OOT, I think in the early 2000s. I played it many times, and have probably beaten it more times than I've beaten OOT. That's maybe the **only** example of a boss that requires any thought at all. 

And that's not GOOD because it goes one of two ways. Either it's ""where the hell do I go"" which is poor game design, or the game tells you (I think it does, but I can't remember, honestly) in which case it's not exploration, it's just a stall.  

&gt;the majority of bosses (in ALL 3-D Zeldas )don't
A) Require thought or
B) Interact with a 3-D world in meaningful ways.

None of the bosses in LTTP require any real thought. Certainly not a majority. And it gets a pass  just for being 2D?  I don't understand why ""interacting with a 3D world"" is important. "
114423,"I can't say I agree, at all. Most of them require absolutely no thought besides ""don't walk into their attacks, and hit them with your sword"". But I guess that's just a matter of opinion."
