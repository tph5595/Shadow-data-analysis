5872,"Great video but I have a few points I'd like to bring up.

The Goron A.I. mechanic suggested would have been awful for the N64. Think Natalya from Goldeneye. It would have been awfully similar, maybe only slightly better. 

Also, I think this video ignores the sense of adventure players can gain from being immersed in a story. LTTP and older Zelda games couldn't involve players in a ""legend"" like OoT could. It's why I personally think A Link Between Worlds is better than LTTP. The story was enough to get me interested, to actually want to save the world and the characters I cared about within it.

Earlier in the video, Egoraptor praised LTTP for having a feature where you get an item from a completely different location in the world to defeat a boss. Later, he complains about having to get and then play Saria's Song for Darunia in OoT. Honestly, I liked the animation and the work put into the video, but it seemed rather biased."
59093,"&gt;Not entirely true. Ocarina never once encouraged me to explore.

You're missing my point too. Ocarina of Time did encourage players to explore in its story. Again, Egoraptor misunderstood an audience that can be encouraged to explore a *story*. Leaving the Kokiri Forest, the player is prodded to seek out the Princess Zelda. How do you do that? You explore Hyrule Field. You seek out information about her. You discover how to sneak into the castle. I get that players like you and Egoraptor aren't into stories told through games but that in itself is exploration.

&gt;You obviously missed the point there if you thought that was unwarranted. This is exactly the point: ALttP compelled you to find that item because it would make you feel like a badass while beating a badass boss (it also implied what you were looking for, since you were already given one rod and it implied that you then needed one of the exact opposite nature, so you'd go back to the region where you found an ice dungeon). Ocarina attempted to compel you to find an item because it would progress the story. Therein lies the problem--it should make you feel compelled to finish because of awesome gameplay lying ahead, not because it would open up new dialogue!

Again, as a child, the reward for getting Saria's Song was the *new dialogue.* The story in itself can be a reward for certain gamers. I'm a gamer who plays for immersion. I loved being able to consider myself a friend of the Gorons, much like you and Egoraptor liked to get immersed by your own merits in the game.

&gt;Compare that to Dark Souls, where you felt compelled to open up the world because of new gameplay experiences and challenges to be found--then the story would open up with you and you can choose to follow or ignore it, but at least it didn't shove story down your throat in order to unlock more gameplay.

This is more personal so it doesn't apply to my argument, but maybe it would at least explain a little why story means so much to me. I played OoT as a child when I was first learning to read. If it wasn't for that game, I'm not sure I would have had such an interest in writing. Plenty of my friends learned how to read through those games and children continue to read through games like Banjo Kazooie, Paper Mario, Pokemon, etc. If it wasn't for the story being shoved down my throat in OoT, I would be a different person today.

59831,Thank you for the Matthewmatosis! I'm just minutes into his Ocarina of Time review and he's already explaining what makes the story interesting. It's so refreshing. I'm interested to hear his criticisms when I finish the video coming home from work. Should be good.
