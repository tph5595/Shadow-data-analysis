56022,"Yeah, he makes that a really good point.
I remember leaving dungeons from ALttP, ALbW and (mostly) WW and thinking ""I don't know where to go next, guess I'll go explore this huge land/sea for a bit"". Being forced to explore was a good thing.
But in OoT, TP, MC and SS every time I left beat a boss and left the dungeon, something/someone would say ""Good job Link, now we much use X go get to Y, so you can get part 3/5 of Z to beat Ganon and save Zelda!"" 
I'm not saying it's bad or that one method is better than the other, but there is defiantly a change that was had.
*Disclaimer: I think MM was a mix of both and awesome."
