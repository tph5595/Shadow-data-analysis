2591,"I felt the same way at some parts. However, Egoraptor's logic is usually well-reasoned from his premises, which are his preferences of gameplay. If you don't agree with the preference, then the conclusion seems unfair and biased when it is stated like a fact.

I still thought it was a good Sequelitis. It made me think about things that I hadn't previously. People have been asking him to explain his distaste for Ocarina of Time for so long, and he has finally done so. At this point, people have to just disagree with his opinion; they can't claim that he didn't defend it. I certainly disagreed with some of his opinions on why I play the games (he can't speak for all people), what I value in the gameplay, etc., but I respect them."
