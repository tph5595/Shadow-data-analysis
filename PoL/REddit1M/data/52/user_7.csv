9057,"SS was my least favorite and I have played all but a couple of the GBA Zelda's.

I am biased towards 2D games like egoraptor.

I hated the forced motion in SS and the constant back and fourth.

TP is my favorite 3D Zelda, favorite Zelda is aLttP (biased because of nostalgia as a child) with a close second of link between worlds."
