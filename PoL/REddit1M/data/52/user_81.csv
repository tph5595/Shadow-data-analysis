9613333,"This is just a shower thought, but I can think of something that would be so much better than story in the form of dialogue. How about story in the form of flashbacks of events or events that actually happen in front of you? What if you were actually watching what was happening rather than being told what happened? This is something that can be done so well in a 3D game if done right.

Here's an exercise to sort of help explain what I'm talking about. Play through OoT, and every time someone is explaining story to you to advance the plot, think about how that story could be shown to you visually and emotionally in a way that involves you. Think about how the story could be told to you in a way that makes you actually care about it. Think about how the game could have allowed you to actually live the story even if partially. It's hard to think of examples of this, because what I'm trying to recall is story the game couldn't make me care enough about. 

I know there are plenty of examples of OoT actually doing this, but it could be better.

Edit: words, grammar"
