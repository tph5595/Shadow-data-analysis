I have to agree that OoT started a hand-holding trend that came to it's worst in SS (though I still love the story in SS), and I'm also looking forward to the (hopefully) open-world WiiU Zelda. Also, keep in mind that this is just his opinion and his personal preference is geared to value gameplay more than story, and that he does not dislike OoT just because he has complaints about it, it's possible to like things and have complaints about it."

I would argue however that the DS Zelda titles started the trend of returning to a temple, and that got tedious very quickly. And I appreciate what SS tried to do with the motion controls for combat, but it just doesn't quite work as I'd hope. In spite of that I still enjoy all of the Zelda games, but I'm hopeful that the new WiiU Zelda will be an open world to explore like they are promising it will be."
