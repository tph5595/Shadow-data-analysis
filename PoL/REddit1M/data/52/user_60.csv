There are usually multiple ways to go about it having found it and using it to your advantage and kicking a boss' ass feels rewarding. Sarai's song is required and the only way to progress the game and running all the way to the lost woods and back to death mountain just to progress doesn't feel very rewarding, it feels like a chore, which is technically bad design.

77170,The biggoron sword in General is great design. Side quest is a tad but tedious but very rewarding.
