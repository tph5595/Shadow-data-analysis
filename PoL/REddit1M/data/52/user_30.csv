30111,"I agree with pretty much everything he said about Skyward Sword, but I still really enjoy that game. It was *terrible* with exploration factor, but at least its dungeon design and combat were pretty sweet. Also, its story was awesome.

But he's still right with his critiques about it."
31147,"It's not biased--he's the type of gamer that makes gameplay the absolute priority in video games, because that is what is supposed to be its specialty as an entertainment medium. I agree with pretty much everything he said (despite liking SS even knowing his critiques were completely valid).

I'll address your points too.

- That was just one idea he had. It was something he thought of off the top of his head, but it was meant to bring a point across: make the player feel *motivated* to care by his own choice. Story should make you care, not scream in your face, ""Hey! You should care about this!""

&gt;Also, I think this video ignores the sense of adventure players can gain from being immersed in a story.

Not entirely true. Ocarina never *once* encouraged me to explore. My two brothers never felt to explore it either. Wind Waker has the best story in the franchise, yet its vast open world hardly ever felt interesting to me (mostly because I found out early that the rewards for exploration were miniscule and that a ton was always blocked off in an unnatural ""look, don't touch"" way). On the other hand, LoZ1, ALttP, and LA were so good at giving me the sense of adventure that several times I'd take a break of a few hours from the main story to discover new things, and then feel rewarded each time I did. 

Hell, I was under time constraints to finish ALttP my first time through, yet while I was playing the game, I had constantly said to myself, ""Okay I only have 3 days to finish this game, I *need* to get back on tra--hey, what's that thing over there?"" And then I'd go off exploring for a few hours, even *knowing* I was in a rush. And it wasn't that the main story was boring--I had a blast pretty much all the way through! But the world was so equally compelling! I like ALBW more than ALttP too, but that's because it had both the more interesting story while keeping *almost* as compelling a world to explore!

&gt;Earlier in the video, Egoraptor praised LTTP for having a feature where you get an item from a completely different location in the world to defeat a boss. Later, he complains about having to get and then play Saria's Song for Darunia in OoT.

You obviously missed the point there if you thought that was unwarranted. This is exactly the point: ALttP compelled you to find that item because it would make you feel like a badass while beating a badass boss (it also implied what you were looking for, since you were already given one rod and it implied that you then needed one of the exact opposite nature, so you'd go back to the region where you found an ice dungeon). Ocarina *attempted* to compel you to find an item because it would progress the story. Therein lies the problem--it should make you feel compelled to finish because of awesome *gameplay* lying ahead, not because it would open up new dialogue! It felt like a gatekeeper where the only way through each door was to feel *forced* to listen to the story. Compare that to Dark Souls, where you felt compelled to open up the world because of new gameplay experiences and challenges to be found--*then* the story would open up with you and you can choose to follow or ignore it, but at least it didn't shove story down your throat in order to unlock more gameplay."
31606,"I'll play devil's advocate to those points:

- Keese are ridiculously flimsy and nonthreatening enemies, and they come in large amounts. If you are forced to kill them each individually, one at a time through locking on, it's way less enjoyable than marching in slashing freely like a badass. It's a matter of getting tasks done in 2 seconds rather than 20.

- I can make two points to defend LoZ1 in that area of bombing random walls: 1) Most of the time, the random walls were optional. Big difference between optional fun paths opening up and having to shoot an eye in order to progress the main quest. 2) With the exception of the Second Quest, 90% of the time the walls weren't random--signs around the area would almost always imply that that specific spot was holding something. It was a matter of deciphering the world, and then being rewarded for successfully deciphering it. For me, when I found those random secrets, I'd first say, ""there's something funny about this place...and there's something funny about that spot over there...I wonder..."" and then I'd find a reward. So yes, big difference between that and having to shoot an eye in what was usually point blank sight.

- They may be overblown nitpicks if they appeared once or twice in the game, but each of these problem areas (and awesome areas for LoZ1) appeared *many* times throughout that the game. Dozens of times...the number 2 is quite small to the number 100, but what happens when you add together the number 2 fifty times? You get 100."
31913,"&gt;How can he ride LttP's dick and comment on good game combat and not mention Moldorm? That was a god awful design.

We're talking one boss versus most of the rest of the game. With Ocarina, his critiques were for majority of the game while one of the only good parts he thought of were the Iron Knuckles. So yes, he can call ALttP's combat good if it's good 90% of the time while OoT's can be considered worse for 95% of the time.

&gt;Lttp also had you advancing through the world via obtaining items from dungeons. Bombs opened up new paths, hookshot helped cross gaps vital to progression and the mirror did the same.

Yes, but Ocarina of Time had a little of this, *and* areas that were blocked off purely by story (and for me at least, these far outnumbered the areas blocked off by just items). Just having ALttP's way was more natural--the cycle of challenge-&gt;reward feels more direct, less obstructed.

And for the other critiques, he did mention earlier in the video that LoZ1 did it even better. He probably enjoyed LoZ1 more than the other two by a longshot by his tone."
32003,"When Egoraptor muttered, ""And I love it,"" I was cheering to myself, ""YES! THANK YOU!"""
32701,"I loved this video. Also, he perfectly explained why my top 3 Zeldas are Link's Awakening, A Link Between Worlds, as Legend of Zelda NES.

...and why my bottom 3 of the 8 I've played are Ocarina, Wind Waker, and Minish Cap ^please ^don't ^hurt ^me ^I ^know ^those ^are ^some ^people's ^favorites.

But I guess I'm not surprised to see a ton of people in this subreddit attacking a lot of his points--so many people here will be offended by anything that attacks certain Zelda games (and I promise you guys, many of those critiques can be traced to Wind Waker tenfold what was seen in Ocarina). I was watching this with my brother, and everything he said just resonated with us a ton (well...almost everything. Despite his very valid critiques on Skyward Sword, my brother and I still really like that game). Some people are even claiming he's ""biased."" He didn't develop the game, and while he mentioned so many things he loved about ALttP later in the video, he spent the first five minutes criticizing it compared to LoZ1. He didn't spend the whole time railing on any one game without offering the good points of it too.

Some of you may claim ""but story can be a good motivator too!"" It shouldn't be the only motivator though. And sometimes, there are ways of seamlessly integrating both gameplay and story to tell an awesome story while still making the gameplay itself feel motivating. See Dark Souls. See Link's Awakening. See Super Metroid.

And I don't usually agree with everything Egoraptor says. I've had many points where I've disagreed with his points. But this, alongside the Megaman Classic vs. Megaman X video, is one of the only times I've ever found just about every one of his points to be completely spot on."
37120,"I think /u/CJtheWriter 's attempt to compare the two may be even more off though. To elaborate on his point, when you get that item, you feel stronger as a player. You feel more badass. Suddenly, that boss is defeatable, and you feel more powerful for it because you're actually acting it out.

When you have to get an item just to advance the plot as you do for Ocarina in many places, you don't get the same feeling of self satisfaction. The sense of growth, of accomplishment, isn't linked to your own play through of the game--it's linked to the cutscene."
75536,"There may be *things* to do (and I know there were--there were like 100 skultulas giving me mostly just bigger wallets and heart pieces, and there was a trade sequence, and there were some arrows, and there was Epona--probably the only truly awesome narrative-based exploration piece), but outside of the trade sequence, I don't recall a single extra thing seeming compelling for me to do for the sake of exploring or for narrative. I did several things just because I was a completionist, but I actually did the same in Skyward Sword. There were *things* to do, but you had to go out of your way in order to really make them seem desirable, even if the rewards were good. But it should not be just about the rewards, but about the experiences to get the rewards. That can either be an awesome narrative attached to it, or ridiculously fun gameplay experiences. 

A Link to the Past's world appealed to me outside of my completionist inclinations--I was attempting to rush through that game, and couldn't help but feel urged to explore. Mostly because each nook and cranny I found wasn't just a reward--it was a puzzle, or an extra dungeon, or some other big challenge or fun gameplay experience, or a charming little side-story *attached* to one of the above. Legend of Zelda 1 had to make you think or take hints from the structure of the world to be able to find those walls to blow up (95% of the time, they weren't random), thus adding challenges to it. A Link Between Worlds had about a dozen optional minidungeons that were fun and challenging, not to mention the 100 Maiamais gave you upgrades that made you feel like an absolute badass each time you got one (and then don't even get me started on the Great Spin). Ocarina of Time's nooks and crannies were often right in the open, and when you reached them, it was just a reward. So it didn't have the interior challenge of ALttP and ALBW, or the exterior one of LoZ1.

It doesn't matter if it's narrative-driven if it's not compelling nonetheless. Majora's Mask is a narrative driven game, but it's exploration is *hugely* compelling. My brother, for example, never once felt compelled to explore in Ocarina of Time, but he sure as hell went out of his way to collect *every single mask* in Majora's Mask. Hell, Majora's Mask was an *amazing* sequel because of that! There have been other awesome narratives in Zelda, but Majora was probably the best ""narrative-driven"" one."
83435,"Ocarina barely encouraged me to explore its story either. It was a good one, but it didn't encourage me enough to look much beyond the beaten path. Now, Majora's Mask encourages player to explore the story--the only interesting thing that happens in Ocarina's story *off* the beaten path was the Epona arc. When you're told to seek out Zelda, it puts a marker on the map (Hyrule field was a giant, empty place to walk across in that path--let's be honest here, that objective did not encourage you to explore the field, it encouraged you to prod across it). Granted, getting into the castle was interesting--he omitted that. But alongside all of that was a ton of filler and walking back and forth to talk to the right people. And I'm coming across this not as someone who is completely disinterested in video game story--KotOR is my second favorite game of all time (and Mass Effect 2 my third) because it encourages me to explore because of the stories going on there, but it is *also* a fun and challenging experience all the way through.

&gt;Again, as a child, the reward for getting Saria's Song was the new dialogue. The story in itself can be a reward for certain gamers. I'm a gamer who plays for immersion. I loved being able to consider myself a friend of the Gorons, much like you and Egoraptor liked to get immersed by your own merits in the game.

There were definitely points were Arin exaggerated the issue. I don't think the Saria's Song part was that bad, because that part was *intriguing*. Helping the Zoras a bit too. However, I never once found the Gorons that interesting. I never found much desire to care until a dragon was reawakened to eat all of them. In this way, I found his points valid where the game almost seemed to *force* itself on you without making either the gameplay *or* the story at the time interesting. There's a reason many people agree that Ocarina starts out quite slow, and only gets truly interesting after the plot twist--that's because *that's* when the story arc also begins to make players care more.

The problem isn't that Ocarina is a bad game. The problem for many (including myself) is that once Zelda began to lose focus on open-world exploration and discovery and focus more on story, the exploration factor began to deteriorate. There's a reason ALttP still has such a huge following--on some sites, it has a bigger following than even OoT. I'm fine with story in video games--Link's Awakening is amazing for its story alongside its awesome gameplay (also my fourth favorite game ever). Super Mario Galaxy is pure gameplay, but the story is there too if you want it, and it is nice, but it never uses the story as a crutch. KotOR's story is also fantastic, but its D20 gameplay is also ridiculously fun. I think where Egoraptor began to stop being as clear was that story should not feel like its the only driving force to continue. It should not be a veil for redundancy. For someone who grew accustomed to A Link to the Past, where story is there but the gameplay itself is also a joy for most of the way through and story never necessarily blocks gameplay, Ocarina of Time felt kinda like that. (For me, Wind Waker was like that except 10x worse in the bad areas.) You can have story in a game, and you can have story-driven games--just don't let it almost feel like a crutch when nicely paced gameplay is missing.

By the way, here's something where he should've been clearer: when there's the gate to the Gorons, there seems to be nothing in your way except for story. When there's an *obstacle* in your way which you are not prepared for, then you are blocked because you are not good enough yet. Maybe you'll get that tool or something on the way to unlocking the story, but then at least it feels like a natural border. *That's* natural progression through a game world. It's not a letter that's a one time use thing that you obtain solely through the cutscenes."
120036,"I mean, I'd disagree. Before I criticize it, I'll elaborate on what I really love about it: the story, the writing, the art style, the music, the atmosphere, the characters...all best in the series for me.

I found there was a lot of padding in many areas, however. While the Triforce hunt is the only thing I'd call ""padding incarnate"", it does take up a significant portion of the game time. I also think the game is generally very slowly paced. Egoraptor mentioned he loved the pacing of LoZ1, ALttP, and ALBW, but didn't like it for OoT. Well, the pacing problems he mentioned in OoT were amplified to be 10x more in Wind Waker for me (and for many others--it's known to be one of the more slowly paced Zeldas in the series).

I think Wind Waker did 3-D combat right in many areas, but I think a lot of the enemies soaked up a bit too much damage for my tastes, sometimes bordering on sponginess. I also really dislike how you can't hurt an enemy while they're down--you can hit one hard enough each time, and then each time he falls, you have to wait another few seconds for him to get up. I also think a lot of the scenarios it put you in really exacerbated its very poor Z-targeting (it was faulty in that it never seemed to target that one enemy you're trying to lock on to). It was also far too easy for my tastes--for such an otherwise intricate, complex, and gratifying combat system, they didn't really give much challenge to it--or a difficulty curve over the game for that matter. Mostly, enemies later on just took more hits to kill--they didn't get tougher to dodge or time attacks against.

I also felt Wind Waker's peculiar linear dungeon order strange, seeing as it was supposed to be a large, open world. I actually felt the game could've benefited from nonlinear dungeon order more than most Zeldas. And I probably wouldn't have noticed this flaw if it didn't actually at one point seem to *force* me in an order. (There was actually one point where it *made* me go somewhere specific, with the only thing blocking me being story.) This instance was the Wind Temple--I wanted to do that first. But what ends up happening is that when looking for Makar, you can't actually access him until *after* you beat the Earth Temple. However, the only thing separating you from that is that the Deku Tree tells you before Earth Temple, ""Oh, Makar is gone for now, but there's no point in looking for him right now--I think you should come back later,"" and the way to him is blocked. Post-Earth Temple, he says, ""Oh Makar is gone right now. Maybe you should go look for him,"" and the way to him is unblocked. At points like that, the game made me feel like I was on a forced track when the paths blocking me to other tracks were...artificial. In areas like that, I *did* feel like the story was there to intrude on me and inhibit my own sense of freedom. And I know they could've done that differently because you don't use the item from the Earth Temple in the Wind Temple even once--and they're both equal in difficulty. It really confused me, to be honest.

So, I mean, I can see where you're coming from from *certain* parts of Wind Waker, but I actually found the virtues of the game you mentioned to actually be interfered with and stifled in several instances throughout my playthrough. But then again, they could've been exacerbated by the fact that before Wind Waker, I had beaten ALBW *twice*--and that game plays as smooth as butter.

"
124902,"I mean, the only version I've ever played actually *was* the HD remake. Not on hero mode, mind you, but the problem is that even without Hero mode, I never got below half health for about 95% of the game, which was a bit disheartening. Also, I never actually said I didn't like sailing--that's actually one of my favorite parts. My only qualm with it is that because of its nature, backtracking across the ocean becomes an issue once in a while. What's funny is that when people criticize Wind Waker, a lot of the time they point to sailing, whereas I'll actually claim I really liked it too!

While Wind Waker did have some stuff to do while going to place to place, I found the quality of that stuff only high relative to other 3D Zeldas (as you mentioned, Ocarina had less; TP and SS also had less). However, having played LoZ1, ALBW, and ALttP right before it, I had a different comparison point, maybe just because those games are just *tops* with making the overworld compelling and interesting. It's not just the quantity of stuff in those games--it's that each nook and cranny you find can lead to an entirely new challenge or minidungeon. Many rewards you get from exploration aren't just the normal heart pieces and bottles and rupees--they're superpowered weapons and new tools a lot of the time (not to mention that the value ALBW put on rupees actually made even those rupee rewards interesting). I will, however, gladly say Wind Waker had the best exploration from a 3D Zelda--my comparison point is simply those 2D Zeldas.

Also, I won't go out and say *all* 2D Zeldas have good exploration either--Wind Waker still did exploration *far* better than Minish Cap and the DS games. It's just that for me, no 3D Zelda games have come close to making the overworld compelling as Link's Awakening, LoZ1, ALttP and ALBW have.

By the way, I just want to say--I don't dislike Wind Waker. Hell, for its good elements, I really like the game a lot. But I have problems with it still. Nevertheless, there's only one of the 8 Zeldas I've finished that I didn't love, and it was Minish Cap. It's not that I dislike Minish Cap, but for me that game was the ""good, not great"" at everything it did, while the other 7 I've played *excelled* in at least one or two areas."
131129,That's definitely a good point. I guess that's why there really are two completely different camps on the issue.
2584408,"Valid points, sir, but there's also a bit of rebuttal that can happen. Simply, while there were a limited amount of places to bomb and you can brute force it, think about how easy it was to find bombs in LoZ1. You can farm them, but it may take a while. And while there was at most 1 place to bomb per over world square, there are MANY more over world squares than bombs in your pack, and if you wanted to test out your bombs on every single possible spot by your logic, you'd be spending many hours bombing, refilling, bombing. 

This is why, the notes you made about the possibilities (in my opinion) actually helped the game because they reduced the number of spots, but *then* you'd have to take the hints that I mentioned if you didn't want to spend all of your time farming. Those two things together minimize the amount of time taken to farm, and maximize your success rate of finding bombable spots (to the point where by the end of the game I was smart enough so that 9 out of 10 bombs I'd drop would open a secret door).

And in the end, while I liked finding secret bombable spots in OoT, I *loved* it in LoZ, because while at the beginning of the game it felt like trial and error, when I started catching on, I felt like the game was greatly rewarding me for my gained knowledge. And the rewards felt...rewarding."
