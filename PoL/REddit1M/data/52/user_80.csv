I can still remember the feeling of excitement and anticipation when I played the recorder by the pond concealing Level 7 in the original Legend of Zelda, and the tornado did not appear."

I would disagree slightly that there were a lot of hints for bombing walls in LoZ1's.  There were some hints, yes.  But the main difference is that there was a very limited number of places where a bomb could theoretically work, based on the fundamental rules of the world.  

Every dungeon room had at most 4 bomb-able exits, the center of each wall.  Most rooms had doors, and you knew that it was pointless to bomb a wall with a door already in it.  Plus, you could find a map that would (almost always) tell you if there was anything on the other side of a given wall.  

In level 7, for example, 7 of 14 blank walls are bomb-able if you use the map to rule out possibilities.  9 of 16 if you correctly guess how the map is wrong.  I count 35 walls that the map should rule out, which is still not crazy if you decide to brute-force it.  And level 7 is meant to be a tricky puzzle dungeon, and has far more bomb-able and not-bomb-able walls than any of the previous dungeons.  (The map is 100% accurate at predicting bomb-able walls for the first 3 dungeons)

In the overworld, every screen had at most one secret entrance.  Bombs only worked on south-facing walls, and you could check 2 squares at a time with a carefully placed bomb.  There was usually no more than 6 to 10 bomb-able squares on a particular screen, and you had ALL GAME to find them."
