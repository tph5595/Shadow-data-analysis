Armos Knights: You can just use your sword a bunch. You can even use your boomerang to damage them!

Helmasaur King: You can break his mask with bombs. I actually think this is a safer strategy.

Moth boss: You can just use your sword.

Ice Castle boss: You can thaw them out with Bombos, although it's a lot more expensive on the magic meter.

All the other dungeons give you equipment instead of items so they have a different strategy anyway.

In OoT, you pretty much need the specific dungeon item you just got to stun or make the boss vulnerable, then you wail on it with your sword. I think you can stun Queen Gohma with Deku nuts instead of the slingshot, and for Bongo Bongo the dungeon item was the Hover boots, so not really helpful for fighting, but all the other bosses require the dungeon item."
