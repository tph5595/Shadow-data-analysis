36392,"I think the last game did an excellent job recapturing that sense of adventure, even in a map that was based upon a previous overworld.   Hopefully this is where the Wii U Zelda is going.

That said, I really, REALLY wish that they'd get rid of some of the staples.   I've wanted a Zelda game that really surprises me with items since WW.   Most items feel like variations upon a seemingly required theme, and the ones that don't end up being gimmicks that get used once or twice towards the end of the game; then forgotten(see the Ball &amp; Chain from TP).  The lack of variation in items really hampers my sense of exploration since it feels less like discovering new weapons, than ticking off a checklist of staples(boomerang, arrows, bombs) and returning favorites(fire rod, ice rod, hammer, hook shot-esque device)"
37047,"I liked the episode, but I think he really missed a huge point that's important when considering OOT:

It was the progenitor of a vast amount of 3D Zelda tropes.   It was the first one to implement 3D gameplay.   As a result, you see a formula which is almost exactly the same as LttP(3 initial dungeons, reveal of a new quest/world, and defeat the rest of the dungeons).

While this has become something of a trope for Zelda in general, the resources focused upon bringing the series to 3D meant that aspects which defined and distinguished future games in the series from each other(e.g. sailing/art style in WW, going into walls in LBW, Skyloft in SS, etc.) were absent in OOT.

The result is a world and gameplay which honestly feels a touch bland, and highly structured towards the next goal.   Looking back, I seriously don't understand the continued praise for OOT.   It's a technically impressive game, and fun; but like AC1 I can't help but feel it's more powerful as a proof of concept than as a game.  As a game it feels skeletal and highly conservative.   MM has always felt like the better game simply because they had the system set up already, and all they had to do was create a game which truly felt fresh.

To be fair, these are highly retrospective observations; but I feel they're fair points."
