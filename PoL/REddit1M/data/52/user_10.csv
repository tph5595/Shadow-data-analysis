Not my favorite Zelda of all times, but I still liked it."
11339,I guess it really depends on what you expect from a game to give you
61742,"The keyword here is tried, which not necessarily means it succeeded on doing.

Right, first convention I felt it tried to challenge was how you visit a temple once and then never think about them again. I remember at least one instance of having to return to a temple.

The second I can think of is the flow of battle. As Arin very well pointed out, post OoT Zelda combat was mostly based around timing (waiting). SS tried to make it based around ""precision"" slashing using the entire motion control mechanic.

It also touched on how a Boss does not necessarily has to be fought on a temple, but TP had already done some of that.

I remember noting some others as I played, but that was some time ago and I do not remember. "
63048,"I just hope they learn from the experience of  A link Between Worlds. Back when I bought that game with cautious optimism. Now, I am not sure it ALBW or MM is my favorite Zelda game of all time.

I really enjoyed the liberty that game gave me. "
