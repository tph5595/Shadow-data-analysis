79640,"People understood that he was playing with company and was trying to be entertaining. There are many episodes in the playthrough where they're just dicking around and having fun with the charm of the game.

The general consensus amongst the haters, though, is that Arin spent a good portion of the episodes blaming the game itself for being stupid and not himself and then making it come off as legitimate criticism. He could have just made a point about not reading the directions but instead went the route of shouting about how much the game sucks for not holding his hand enough.

Not to mention Dan knows almost NOTHING about the Wind Waker so he can only take Arin's opinions to influence his own.
