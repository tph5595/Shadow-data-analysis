103372,"You're implying Ocarina of Time is thought-provoking? Give me one point where you stopped and thought a puzzle or boss in OoT was hard or challenging. His point was that the bosses in aLttP were challenging because a lot of the time you didn't know what to do. Sure, the final goal in the end was to smack it around, but there were different **ways** of doing it. Let's take Helmasaur for an example. Sure you can use the dungeon item, but getting in close to him for long isn't easy. So what can I do if I'm bad at games? I can throw bombs at him to break the mask instead! He isn't saying that aLttP's bosses are challenging or hard, but rather that when you have non-formulaic battles they're more entertaining. I love both games,  but in OoT, aside from Bongo-Bongo and Ganon, the boss battles rarely require thought, or lend themselves to alternative methods."

In my opinion that's how story in Zelda should be. aside from the first two dungeons, Wind waker rarely MADE you go somewhere or do something, and the story was merely there to progress the explorations and advancements the player makes."

103715,His style? I find it entertaining.

Pick one.  

But in all honesty, when I read your comments is that you've never played aLttP, or only watched other people play it. When you fight that guy with three heads without the ice rod, you can't win because ... well ... YOU DON'T HAVE THE ICE ROD. You watch someone play the game and fight him, you're like ""well duh, you need the ice rod!"" But when you play the game for the first time, you're just like ""Well, shit! How do I beat him?"" Then you go exploring until you find the ice rod, and it all clicks together. What Ego's getting at isn't that OoT's bosses are bad, (even though the majority of them are.) but that the majority of bosses (in ALL 3-D Zeldas )don't  
  
A) Require thought or  
B) Interact with a 3-D world in meaningful ways.

123301,"I don't know, I just replayed the HD remake in hero mode and that solved pretty much all of your mentioned issues. Difficulty was fine and I never really had the aforementioned l-targeting issues. I only mention it because as I said, I completed the game this morning and there was no issues, nostalgia goggles or not. As for the sailing, like I said, I actually enjoy it! The HD remake fixes a lot of the tediousness other players found, but the way I've always played WW is that since the triforce quest is presented to you alongside the last two dungeons, if you look at the whole triforce thing as something to do alongside other stuff it gets done extremely quickly and rather seamlessly. A lot of people describe wind waker as divisive between Zelda fans, and I guess it's because people experience games differently.  
  
As for the linearity, yes the dungeons were linear, but the thing that made Wind Waker great was that there was all this stuff to do while going from place to place. Using OoT as contrast, the only thing that I had to do when I was going somewhere was, well, Walking! Sure the game is rather linear, but it rewards you for exploring, which is why I love it so much."
