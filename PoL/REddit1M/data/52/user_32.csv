I think my biggest issue with Arin even mentioning and criticizing Skyward Sword in a Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time comparison was that he was connecting it to the issues that 3D Zelda brings - Z-Targeting specifically - and all the waiting around in OoT. 

There's a huge gap of waiting around in SS and OoT when in combat. The beauty of motion controls is feeling like you're doing something and in control aside from timing or mashing buttons like you do in OoT. There were so many enemies that were necessary to slice diagonally or horizontally or what have you to hurt or kill. You can even walk while swinging your sword - I'm pretty sure you had to stop in place, Z-Target, and then attack with your sword in OoT. That's what separates SS and OoT: you have control over how Link swings his sword and it's you the player's fault for not taking your time and learning so you can improve the next time you face another one of those enemies.

Another thing is when he's bashing on Z-Targeting. Z-Targeting is an amazing feature and obviously a necessity in 3D Zelda games because of bats or whatever. There's a reason Z-Targeting is in 3D Zelda and not 2D/Overhead. But you - Arin - are basing your argument on how hard Z-Targeting is to use in comparison to a game that doesn't have Z-Targeting - Link to the Past. LttP doesn't need Z-Targeting because it isn't a 3D Zelda, so of course the controls are going to be different. It's not just some effortless mashing of the A-Button. If you're not learning how to use Z-Targeting properly, then you're not playing the game right and that's your fault. That's the player's fault. You are given limitations - you can't just come swinging into a room and expect to beat everything by mashing the A-Button, you have to do things methodically. It's not as simple as stepping aside from an enemy so you can hit them (although sometimes it is that easy, in either 2D or 3D Zeldas) like it is in LttP. It's evident he doesn't know how to use it in Wind Waker and I did just find as a 12 year old.

Clearly, 3D Zelda is just not for him because of its limitations in exploration but also the complexity and new horizons 3D brings. There's a lot to be built upon a 2D field because it's simpler in comparison to a 3D Zelda, but add a whole new depth and 3D does get more complicated and that's not Arin's fault. It's his fault he sucks at 3D Zeldas, but it's not his fault they're more complicated than 2D. So it's good he's found a comfort zone in 2D and hopefully Zelda Wii U's open world experience will enlighten him and maybe he'll get around to being more comfortable with Z-Targeting too.

Also, Hyrule Warriors is not cannon so plz don't freak out Arin and give the game a chance, good lord. It's just a Dynasty Warriors with a Zelda skin. "
