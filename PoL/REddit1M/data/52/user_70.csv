84811,"Eh no. What he does here is what he's done throughout all the sequelitises. He presents his opinion as fact. The only problem is that this isn't nearly as well thought out as the other sequelitis vids. The other vids were pretty subjective, even the Megaman x one in spite of his bias. In this his bias shines brightly and most of his points here are either invalidated by being based on false information or just plain hypocritical. 

I'm really disappointed in this installment and almost tempted to make my own video criticizing OoT because this was so awful. I love the game, it's not the best but it's my favorite and it does deserve proper criticism but this wasn't it.
