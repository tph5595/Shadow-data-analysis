I mean, it isn't one of my favorite Zeldas and I have complaints, namely the motion controls working only 70% of the time (more a problem with the hardware than the software), but I enjoyed the game and the world that it was set in. I think some people equate ""not being as good as Ocarina or Wind Waker"" to meaning ""this game is shit and I hate it"". It's still a really good game, even if it has some annoying aspects and isn't one if my personal favorites in the series."

Ego says in the video that Ocarina didn't have the same sense of exploration as LttP (not saying I don't agree with him), but that definitely hasn't been a constant trend since OoT. Most if the top down Zelda games since Ocarina, such as the Oracle and Minish Cap games, have a lot of the same open exploration and world full of hidden caverns and even alternate worlds to discover. Twilight Princess and Skyward Sword were more like OoT, but Wind Waker is arguably the most vast and expansive Zelda, with dozens of different islands unrelated to the main story and more to discover and explore than I believe LttP had. And I don't need to say much about aLBW, since it's ""Link to the Past 2"" in Japan.I guess that some Zelda games have had less exploration, such as Ocarina, but there definitely hasn't been a trend where all Zelda games after LttP have been losing the adventurous spirit of the originals."
