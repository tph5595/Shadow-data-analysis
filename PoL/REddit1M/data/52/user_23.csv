It's true that Zelda has become more linear, story-driven... but that's only a bad thing if you don't play for a rich story-driven experience. There's nothing wrong with ""reading a book"".

The complaint about the waiting was a bit exaggerated IMO. The waiting is only bad if you aren't using that time to look around and take in the world. That was the the major draw at that time. *Except for the guides. Fuck all the Fi/Midna/Navi handholding that is not exposition."
