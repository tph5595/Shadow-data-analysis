56168,"Sounds like a description for the Wii itself. How many games for the Wii had the primary negative of shitty controls?

Not excusing SS for it, just a thought I had. Actually, Skyward Sword is my favorite game of all time because the controls worked perfectly for me, but for so many others they didn't. I don't understand why, but that is quite a problem for the game."
