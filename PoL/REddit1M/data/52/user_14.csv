At 17:30 he mentions how it's a bad thing that in OoT, you obtain an item and it's vital to advancing through the dungeon and killing the boss. LttP was the same!

Armos knight: shot with the bow obtained in dungeon.

Helmasaur king: Mask broken with the hammer obtained in dungeon.

Arrghus: Used the hookshot to open up for damage and also obtained in dungeon. etc.

Lttp also had you advancing through the world via obtaining items from dungeons. Bombs opened up new paths, hookshot helped cross gaps vital to progression and the mirror did the same.

I get that it's a critique, I feel as if there's too much personal bias for me to take his opinion seriously."

&gt;In OoT, you pretty much need the specific dungeon item you just got to stun or make the boss vulnerable, then you wail on it with your sword.

* Gohma
Dungeon item: Slingshot
Can defeat with deku nuts which are acquired before the dungeon.
* Phantom Ganon
Dungeon item: Bow
Can defeat with hookshot which is acquired before the dungeon.
* Morpha
Dungeon item: Longshot
Can defeat with normal hookshot, or even just a sword. Though the latter is difficult. I've read the boss is also defeatable with Din's Fire thought I've never personally seen this.
* Bongo Bongo
Dungeon item: Hover Boots
Hover Boots are in no way are required during the boss battle.
* Ganon
Dungeon item: Technically none, but you do get the light arrows right before so I will count those as the dungeon item.
You can use the Biggoron's Sword to reach his tail instead of using light arrows. Don't want to go an a huge quest for that sword? Oh, the Megaton Hammer also works. Don't like to touch this? Longshotting him works. Oh, and Deku Nuts, which you acquire before the first dungeon in the game.

That's 4/8 dungeon bosses, and 1/2 end-bosses that do not require their dungeon item. If we included minibosses in this it'd be a longer list, but I wanted to keep things simple.

EDIT: Heck you don't even need the sword for the phantom ganon fight, The devil's volley can be done with an empty bottle.
