And I think the stamina gauges were a great idea.  It added a real sense of danger; your shield could break, leaving you vulnerable (which made the Hylian shield that much more special).  It made exploration a lot quicker too (in certain situations).   No one can hang on to a wall forever or sprint for 10 minutes straight so I don't get why people hate the stamina gauges."
