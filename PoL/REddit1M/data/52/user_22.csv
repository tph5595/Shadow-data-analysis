21606,I wasn't an English speaker when I played the Zelda games. Exploring was HARD. Finding the Kokiri sword in OoT took me a couple of days.
106660,"It was fun! I didn't know what Mido and the guy that was blocking the entrance to the village were saying to I tried to roll past them for a while,ran around in the Lost Woods,broke some pots,tried to get to the place where there is a heart piece (without having seeds for the flower). I would just alternate between those things until a friend came over and got the sword for me. He was almost done with the deku tree when my mom pulled the cartridge out saying we had played enough. I had it it my head that you could jump across the water in the deku tree's lower part(after jumping down from the skutullas all the way at the top and breaking the web) instead of shooting the eye on the wall,going around and pushing the block down enabling the shortcut to the boss. I was probably stuck on this for a week until I spotted the eye on the wall.After that it was kind of easier,I had dictionary beside me during the whole game and eventually got out of the village into that ""huge"" world...I still remember the feeling of taking out the master sword and thinking ""now the real part starts"" like all I did was a tutorial. I got all the way up to the ""Dead Hand"" and just gave up out of fear."
