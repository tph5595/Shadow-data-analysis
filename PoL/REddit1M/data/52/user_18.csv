I've heard varying reports from them working flawlessly to them only working depending on the proper alignment of the stars and at least three livestock sacrifices.

Even if I were in the former camp (My experience was at neither extreme, but close enough to the latter to make the final boss fight enough of a pain as to not feel worth it), I'd consider that a quality control failure, and possibly patch the game to work with a Classic Controller Pro.

But that's just me."

While you probably could make Skyward Sword's swordplay work on a standard controller (And if they did and patched SS to use it, I'd probably like it more), it'd be easier to simply go back to Press B to Sword."
