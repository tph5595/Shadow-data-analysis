121536,"As much as I love literally every point he made against OoT and agreed with all of them, cause I also find it boring as hell, I have to keep in mind in the past comments Arin has made about other games has come back to bite him in the ass, along with general lack of video gaming knowledge.

That said, the funniest part about this whole video is the one he never said:

Arin was being super polite as hell to JonTron every time he brought up OoT, all those times Jon brought it up, he was biting his tongue about all the hate he has for that game.

I salute you Arin.

Also, props to Arin for when talking about how the game makes you wait repeatedly for no reason, he fought the urge to bring up King Zora"
