68244,"Yeah I also never really cared about how slow treasure opening is or the 'surprise' of a boss fight. But the slowness and repetition of the majority of fights is pretty bad.
But yeah you can call it fanboyism, but I see it more like he has old gaming sensibilities. The design choices that he praises are what you'd expect from something made for the Arcade or NES.

And yeah his main argument is against following formulas for sequels. Like in his Mega Man episode he praises the game because of its new mechanics, how they're introduced, and how the levels make use of them.
Then you have Castlevania IV which heavily alters how the player interacts with the game, but continues to use level design as if these changes were never made. That's basically his problem with LoZ: OoT.

Newer Zelda games just don't have the openness that the first three had. Link's Awakening is actually pretty limited at the start of the game. Over three quarters of the world is completely inaccessible until you finish a quest after the first dungeon. And even then there's still a lot you can't explore until the game wants you to reach that point.

These Zelda games are making a choice to have less open exploration to reduce possible frustration. This is a difficult balancing act for any game. Personally I'm not a huge fan of the original Zelda's many hide aways. I like to have hints from NPCs or some other indicator to point me in the general vicinity of a hidden area. Yeah Zelda I has that here and there, but still a lot of things are only discovered by bombing every wall and burning every tree. I find Metroid on the NES to be even worse with its random hidden areas.

A Link To The Past has some of these problems as well. Though the ability to check hidden paths in walls with your sword was a godsend. But yeah I really don't enjoy the combat half as interesting as I do in saw Skyward Sword. He may hate on the game a lot for its incredible linear nature, but I found the game made every encounter that much more interesting. I enjoyed the 'gimmick' of sword-wii mote alignment. I felt much more engaged with an enemy because of it and it made my choices feel that much more important.

I mean in the end, games are all about feeling aren't they? Sure all you have to do in OoT to jump over gap in a bridge hovering over lava is hold forward, but to me it added a sense of danger. A reminder of the threats all around me and the perils of the dungeon. I think all of the Zelda games, the linear or not so linear, do a great job of conveying good feelings.

Haha I sound like Iwata now. Let me stop."
