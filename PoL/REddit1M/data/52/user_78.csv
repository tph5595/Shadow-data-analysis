A lot of the situations he complains about you waiting are situations that you aren't really free to ""look around and take in the world.""

Also there is nothing wrong with ""reading a book,"" it's just that the Zelda games equate to children's books more than deep literature."

Also how every time you open any chest, EVERY SINGLE ZELDA GAME HAS TO EXPLAIN WHAT EVERY ITEM DOES.  Why does the 5th dungeon have to explain to me what the map is for?  And the compass?  And bombs?  We've picked up all these things before!"
