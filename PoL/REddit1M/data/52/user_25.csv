In OoT you had to get things in a certain order to even advance to a certAin dungeon and that's not the only 3D Zelda that does it, they all do that. The true open world Zelda games were the original and ALBW but most of the old 2D Zelda games didn't really hold you hand throughout the game like the 3D games do. 

Still love them with the exception of SS, Zelda 2 and the cd-I game but I don't count that. "
