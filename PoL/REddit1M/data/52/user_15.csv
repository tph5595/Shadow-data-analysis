However, this video's needless bashing and singling out of Skyward Sword was unnecessary and took the focus away from the direct comparison between A Link to the Past and Ocarina of Time. After all, the video is called ""ZELDA: A Link to the Past vs. Ocarina of Time,"" not ""ZELDA: A Link to the Past vs. Ocarina of Time vs. Skyward Sword."""

Sequelitis is obviously subjective, which is fine. I just got tired of hearing the irrelevant bashing of Skyward Sword."
