81121,"Okay, I've often called Ocarina of Time one of my favorite games of all-time, BUT there were a LOT of very valid points made in this video. I'm not going to defend them, but the thing is, any film professor will tell you, ""You can't take a film out of its time."" And to a certain extent, the same can be said about a lot of video games. Not all of them, but a lot. 1998 was still during a shift in the spectrum, companies were still learning how to go about the new world, like 3D movies were a little while ago.

Companies weren't sure how to go about things, so a lot of design choices were borrowed from actual film (see Twilight Princess). And it was the first one. But my fondest memory of Ocarina of Time, was fighting Ganon. As a child, the scale of everything was so epic, and it wasn't clear what to do right away, as there was no clear ""dunegeon item"" to use. There was every item you collected throughout the game and had to figure out how to do it. THEN, the ONE THING that was always constant was taken away: your sword. You had to get creative and really think about how to win. That is why Ocarina of Time stood out. It was the lasting impression I was left with. I wasn't thinking about the water temple and all that bullshit after beating Ganon. I just knew, I beat Ganon, it was an awesome fight and I had a huge sense of fulfillment for doing it. Yes, it's about time to break down OoT critically, because Nintendo fell into a slump of getting very formulaic since then. But since A Link Between Worlds, it makes me think Zelda could be headed back in the right direction again. But as I started, you can't take some things out of its time and looking at what Ocarina of Time did in its own time, it was a huge achievement.

Ocarina of Time isn't perfect, far from it as pointed out here, but it is definitely one of the most memorable experiences I had playing a game as a child."
