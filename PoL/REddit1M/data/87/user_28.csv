100367,"Horses, how do they work? Like is there any way to know the stats of a horse before you catch them? Can you train them in any way to raise their stats?

Also, how does level/power scaling for enemies work? Will they only get stronger as I get stronger, or is it determined by what area they're in so enemies in region X will always be Y strong?

Lastly, is there a lost of recipes anywhere for the different stuff you can cook? "
