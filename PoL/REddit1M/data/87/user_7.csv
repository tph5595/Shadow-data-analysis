13948,You can definitely tackle vah medoh(sp?) The rito village bird beast with the amount of hearts you have. I advise you to get the outfit that is offered at rito village as it will keep you warm without having to worry about eating meals to keep yourself warm. I just defeated the rito beast and I only had 6 hearts. Wasn't too bad at all. They recommend you have 20 bomb arrows but I opted to get another 20 to be safe. And the extra bomb arrows really came in handy all the way at the end.
