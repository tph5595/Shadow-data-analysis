You can deflect the blast improperly, which will do a small amount of damage to you and the blast that hits the Guardians will be weaker than normal. If you deflect it perfectly, there is no damage to the shield and (depending on the base HP of the Guardian) will one-shot them.

Had this happen to me on the way up Hyrule Castle the other day; broke my shield."
135709,"Yes! If you want the main storyline, follow the “Main Quest” entries in your quest log. This will point you in the direction of where to go and will put markers on your map for each of the story objectives. You will encounter cutscenes, and you can also track down certain specific, mildly hidden locations to trigger Link’s lost memories (more cutscenes).

I won’t spoil it for you, but I loved the storyline. It’s somewhat unclear, but the game seems to be set hundreds/thousands of years after the events of SS, OoT, MM, and TP. There are hidden references to all of the installments (not just the ones mentioned), and you can find little things while exploring that are either the remains of places from previous games, or are landmarks with a subtle nod to characters from the lore.

The game is intended to be open world and exploratory, so the option to ignore storyline is of course present. But if you follow the main quest, you can’t miss the storyline. ;)"
135971,"To your first question - yes and no. The game has 120 shrines to begin with, but the DLC adds more. There is enough Spirit Orbs to *almost* max out your hearts and stamina.

Second - As you play, increase whichever one you feel you most need. There are ways to exchange hearts for stamina, and vice versa, if needed. FYI: There is a specific objective later on that requires a minimum of 13 hearts.

Third - sort of. Shrines are the main way, but you do get a heart after four important storyline bosses, if I remember correctly. (It’s been a while.)

Edited due to below comment. Thank you, vgbhnj!"

In the case I mentioned, I hadn’t played BotW for several months, and on my first time playing after such a long time, I thought it would be a fantastic idea to climb Hyrule Castle and say hi to Ganon. Got hilariously destroyed by numerous Guardians, Lynels, and even a Moblin along the way. Not the finest hour for the Hero of Hyrule, that’s for sure. I was so out of practice at deflecting, dodging, and parrying that I think I went through about 2 or 3 shields before I finally started to get the hang of it again."
141734,Not false at all? I just prayed to the statue yesterday and she said that I had sufficient power and did not need to increase it further.
165820,"Ah, I see. Thank you for explaining. I maxed my stamina first and just assumed the statue’s words meant there was nothing else that could be raised. Didn’t realize there were a few missing hearts from the max capability."
