482820,"Is there an easier method to finding shrines than spotting them from a distance (on foot or up a tower), or using the slate's sensor? The sensor has helped me find a few but I've only done about 12. Most of my current sidequests (and even the main quest) want me to go to areas where mobs are basically one shotting me with five hearts so, kinda need to find those shrines asap. I know there's location lists out there but I'd rather find them myself, just like to get them a bit faster."
