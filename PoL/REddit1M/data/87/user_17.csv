Stamina is great if you want to do a lot of exploring. Essential in climbing, swimming, and running for your little Linky life. 

Hearts are great if you’re going full on genocidal maniac. It saves you from relying on food or potions to sustain yourself. 

Do what fits how you want to play and know that you can change at will, if you ever desire. "
