200623,"Ok, so I've had this game since March and I love it. I've completed both DLCs, and done most things available and am nearing 100%. However, I still feel like there's something missing from the story. I really feel like there should be quests that you do with Zelda once you've beat the final boss as you rebuild Hyrule. Do you think an extra expansion is plausible or not?"
