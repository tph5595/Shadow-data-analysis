489353,"I just defeated thunderblight as my first ganon with only 6 hearts and shitty boko shields and pot lids and some alright melee weapons. The only thing I knew before going into it was that ""lightning rod mechanics"" were going to be involved somehow. I had no idea what that mechanic was. I had no idea what that meant or anything, so that ""spoiler"" didn't really end up spoiling anything for me since it still took me a pretty long while to figure out what to do. No advantage gained from that little spoiler whatsoever. Proud to have defeated him with no real significant outside knowledge going into it. 

(I know I'm super bragging about something not that impressive, but I'm like super proud for beating that as well as mentally drained, so I'm letting it all out and I guess just really want to vent)

I guess my question is, is this really the hardest it gets? How easy are the other 3 ganons compared to thunderblight? Will the rest of the game feel like a breeze compared to the hell that I just escaped?"
