**&gt;&gt; [Read the spoiler policy here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/5woxa9/reminder_starting_with_the_release_of_botw_in/) &lt;&lt;**

**TL;DR:** Major locations/temples and major character names will be allowed in titles with the release of the game. Titles still must be vague and cannot divulge storylines. Boss names, dungeon weapons, plot points are not allowed in titles.

Titles must begin with **[SPOILERS]** when discussing the game or they will be removed.
