407778,"I'm making fireproof elixirs and something strange happened.

I made 3 elixirs out of the exact same ingredients:

Fireproof Lizard

Bokoblin Fang

Bokoblin Guts

Lizalfos Horn

Red Chuchu Jelly

The first elixir I made gave me protection for 10:30, the second for 15:30, and then the third was for 10:30 again. I used the exact same ingredients and I tried to recreate it again for the third one but it just did the same as the first one. Is it random?
