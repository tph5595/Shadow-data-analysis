Tips for getting better:
- Go through the shrine just outside Kakariko Village (Ta'Loh Naeg) to get the moves done a little better. They do take practice though.
- Get the Bomb and Stasis rune upgraded at Hateno.
- Use the Bomb runes in combat. It takes a little practice to throw &amp; denonate well. The round &amp; square bomb are on different cooldown timers so you can alternate them to keep pressure.
- Use the right weapon for the enemy. Your main weapon will be one-handed. Use Spears against bats &amp; lizalfos. Use two-handed against Mobolins and sub-bosses.
- Learn to love the ""spin-to-win"". When holding a two-handed weapon, hold down attack to start spinning with weapon out.
- Use arrow-time. Jump off a ledge and draw your bow to slow down for head shots."
