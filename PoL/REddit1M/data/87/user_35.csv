I know the game really pushes you towards exploring the region north of Hateno, which has a Divine Beast. Also, I think Pikango is the only person who gives hints on other memories, and he's usually at stables or some villages painting.

You saw a Blupee. If you shoot it, you get some rupees. There is also a short sidequest where you have to take a picture of a Blupee and show it to the person."

If you're having trouble with tougher enemies, try making some food that can grant you extra temporary hearts. Just find some materials with the word ""Hearty"" (ex. Hearty Truffle, Hearty Radish) and cook one piece by itself. Upgrade your armor, if possible, to take less damage. "
