I find that helpful, and it also much easier to collect bugs, critters, etc. in that outfit because you can basically walk up to them no problem. I wear that set all the time because of that."
37539,The only place I really harvest food for myself now. Everything else gets cooked and sold.
37644,"I found hitting the main quest line was best towards the beginning, but after you hit two towns, then it's up to you. Having low hearts can be frustrating, but harvesting good weapons is more important in my opinion. "
37748,"They travel to Tarrey Town for an important event, then will sit at another cooking pot there in Tarrey Town. If you talk to them, they go back to your house, so never talk to them again once they're in Tarrey Town"
37872,"After completing a shrine, if you look on your map, a treasure chest icon will appear next to the name if you have emptied every chest in that shrine. There is a couple times where there is an alley behind the monk with a chest or another challenge. But it doesn't happen often."
38076,"It never permanently breaks. It just ""loses power"", and you temporarily cannot use it. It takes 10 minutes before the Master Sword will regain its power again. But /u/Ultimatenut is right, it loses power slower when it is glowing."
38231,"The only way to earn orbs is by shines. I put my heart exclusively into hearts until I had a specific amount needed to unlock something important (don't want to spoil it for you). Once I unlocked that, I started using orbs for stamina a little. Now I just go back and forth. Having low stamina sucks, but you can make stamina increasing elixirs or mushroom skewers easily to replenish it."
41312,"No it only gives you about 1/6 of a ring each time (rough estimation, sorry). But yes, stamina gets capped, and it makes more sense to get the full 30 hearts, in my opinion. Hearts are more helpful late game than tons of stamina."
208266,"I went through the same situation as you. I ended up killing every single stalker around Hyrule Castle and the Central(?) Tower, only obtaining one ancient core. It was incredibly frustrating. However, after a blood moon I went and harvested guardians again in the same area. Surprisingly, I ended up getting ancient cores from four out of the five guardians I fought. Just be persistent. Certain shrines have them as rewards in chests, but it is rare. Sorry I cannot remember which shrines have them. Honestly, harvesting stalkers is your best bet. Best yield for effort."
209765,"You're welcome. Learn how to parry and you can save your ancient arrows or use my technique of using stasis+ on the guardian before hacking off the legs. Every time you cut off a leg, it temporarily cannot attack so you can just repeatedly hit it with a weapon. I use the master sword for this since it cannot break and it has a high attack. Plus, every time you cut off a leg, it gives you a few extra ancient parts like shafts or screws. Stalkers never scare me anymore after practicing this a few times. I don't have to worry about breaking shields by missing a parry or using all my weapons up."
