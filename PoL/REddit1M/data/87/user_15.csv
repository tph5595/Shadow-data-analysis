35211,There 120 shrines right? So how many orbs should I put into hearts and stamina as I go along? Are there ways to earn orbs besides shrines?
38653,"Thanks. I’ve been doing that for stamina so far. I guess if you found them all, you could do 15 and 15 but that seems like a lot of stamina. "
39880,Appreciate it. If you choose stamina does it give you a full ring?
41771,Gotcha. Thanks. I’ve been doing hearts only so far so I’ll do some math on some stamina later. 
45442,I do really like to explore and take the long way to get places. I need to find more shrines right now. I haven’t found one in quite a long time. 
453611,Do I always have to hold my weapons that can be fixed? Like can I drop the lightscale trident and get it replaced?
491024,I was mistaken. I thought it was broken and waiting for repair but it was just badly damaged. Thanks. 
491082,"Thanks. I have discovered this also. I’m up to 12 hearts now, with one more shrine for 13. I’m going for 15 hearts before I do anything stamina related. "
