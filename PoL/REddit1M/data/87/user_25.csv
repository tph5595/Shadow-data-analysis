61589,"When is the Champion's Ballad meant to be played?

I've finished most of the game. I've done all the side quests I care about and done Kass' quest. I haven't spoken with impa since completing the beasts. I'm waiting to do that just before going to the castle


Should I do the champions ballad before or after? Does it matter story wise? I don't care about doing stuff in post game, I want to move on"
