54071,"so im doing the goron city divine beast part now and honestly, I was doing okay but I just got one hit by one of the moblins that was by that goron you have to work with to get on the divine beast (I didnt die bc of the thing I got from ruta) but still??? Should I be concerned?? I have 7 hearts rn and like 1 and 3/4 of the next stamina wheel and these enemies are getting a lot harder rip "
54746,Ive only upgraded all pieces once cuz Ive only found one great fairy fountain so far :( idk where the others are quite yet. Im still a noob so idk how im gonna get through this game 
121934,Does deflecting guardian beams degrade a shield? 
129616,I’ve killed 2 guardian stalkers and a bunch of decayed guardians and I have all this ancient stuff now: what town do I have to go to to redeem all of the stuff? 
137617,"wait so if it’s done imperfectly, it breaks your shield?? or only damages it? "
197707,"I can’t find another ancient core to upgrade my stasis... I’ve upgraded all the other ones with no problems but finding this third ancient core is proving to be extremely difficult. I’ve killed like 8 guardian stalkers and I’ve only gotten like 1 ancient core, the other one I got from a shrine. Is there another shrine I can do to get one? Or do I just have to keep fighting guardians until one finally drops one? "
202670,Only way to get hearts is to complete each divine beast to get 1 heart container a piece &amp; then keep doing lots of shrines. There’s no real “quick” way. I guess you could do shrines until you get 13 but that’d take a long time. 
203341,"Just keep killing monsters and they’ll drop some. Also, a lot of shrines contain chests with weapons. If you’re just off the Great Plateau, that’s normal. Just keep progressing through and you’ll accumulate more weapons"
209065,So I finally upgraded my stasis by saving in front of a stalker and then using an ancient arrow to repeatedly kill it by reloading until I got one. The fifth time of reloading I finally got one. I also got another one by doing a major test of strength and killing the scout. (while severely underpowered but its fine). I guess I can always just save in front of another stalker and keep killing it w the same ancient arrow. I haven’t yet explored Central Hyrule so maybe I’ll just farm them there until I come across more. Thank you!!
212640,"I don’t have the master sword yet, i’ve only got like 8 hearts because I still suck but I can shield parry well like 75-80% of the time; the other 20% I incorrectly parry and take some damage. But I will try to use stasis + and whatever guardian weapon I have in my inventory to see if that works! I totally get why shield parrying can be a nuisance bc if you mess up, it really sucks. i just got stasis+ so I have yet to experiment with it. Thanks for the advice again!"
391424,"Is it acceptable to sell gems or should I save them? I have one save before I sold them so im just wondering if I should keep them all. If they’re super valuable late game, I’ll keep them but if not... "
471262,"Yeah, are gems used for upgrading ancient armor? I haven’t bought any yet but like I can, if you know what I mean. I just got the diamond circlet and I’m aware that there is other circlets so im gonna assume you can upgrade those with gems but are the circlets worth it to upgrade? "
471432,"That’s similar to me but I did one divine beast. I already have the master sword and Hylian shield and haven’t done the other three. I’d do the divine beast at Zora’s Domain first- that’s what I did and the boss fight there is really easy plus the reward you get from that is OP. Other than that, no. "
