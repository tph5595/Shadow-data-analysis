522407,Yes it's really weird but apparently normal for Zelda games. Since the game is very story oriented they would have to re-do the whole world in a way that it's freed from Ganon. Which would be a boring one. So rather you can continue your last save game (the file now has a star icon yay) and do all other stuff before beating Ganon (again?). Then you might get different endings based on what you accomplished.
