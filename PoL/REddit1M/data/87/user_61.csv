536500,Thank you so much. I was hoping I could go back and get the chests I missed. 
536944,Nope. My wife was having trouble getting the stuff to upgrade her bombs and only had 4 or 5 hearts and garbage shields so I showed her how to kill guardians with a potlid. Did 5 or 6 in a row with no issues. Only take durability if you miss.
