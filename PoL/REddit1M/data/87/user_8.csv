19451,"Dodging is a lot easier than you think. But if you aren't experienced with gaming, it could take a bit of practice. Just try fighting a bokoblin and only attack if you do a perfect dodge. Watch them. They'll always do a super big wind up for an attack(except spears) so if you can get the timing down and dodge right as an attack is on the downswing, you'll be golden. Also, a key part of this game is being creative so you don't waste all your weapons. In rain or in a puddle? Lightning weapons/arrows will destroy them. Their ice enemies? Fire will instantly kill them. Skeletons? It only takes one hit on their skull to kill them, so why not use your infinite supply of bombs?"
23797,I'm pretty sure they go away if you fully upgrade your house and then do a certain sidequest in akala.
27505,I'm pretty sure something like that happened once or twice but it was more like there was an alley behind the monk to where I could get a chest.
29064,"Kind of a hard question to answer. The ""main quest"" includes 5 dungeons, 6 bosses, a couple lead up quests, and the tutorial area. But you're gonna spend most of your time doing things like traveling (because of limited stamina) or exploring to find shrines, great fairy fountains, dragons, various side quests and, for many, that could all take 100+ hours.

Then again, you could just run out the tutorial area and head right to the final boss. The game's completely non linear so it's kind of up to you to go at your own pace.  "
29216,"You can't lose the master sword, (you kinda need it after all). The durability goes down like any normal weapon when its not glowing and when it is it goes down by half of what it normally would."
45992,No. After the tutorial your told to go to a village where the chief says take out the 4 divine beasts with points on the map designating them. order doesn't matter and they aren't actually necessary. 
54374,Well what armor are you wearing and how upgraded is it? Black moblins with strong weapons can do a heck of a lot more than 7 hearts of damage if you've got weak armor. 
54856,"If you're ever having trouble with something, do something else or get better. Learn to dodge properly. If you can, you should be fine. If you can't, get more hearts or upgrade your armor. "
58356,That particular example means it would heal 13 hearts. 10+the three others. 
229699,"Fight? Every enemy drops weapons, I don't understand. "
471324,There are a couple hidden treasures in each that you should keep an eye out for. It's an easy way to get giant ancient cores.
