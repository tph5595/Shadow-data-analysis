41538,"&gt; So, how prepared should you be before tackling the champions?

In general the idea with BotW is ""try it and see."" You could've done one of them straight off the Great Plateau if you wanted.

&gt;Also, if you have, for example, upgraded your stealthy outfit set twice, do stealthy elixirs have any added benefit?

Upgrades don't have anything to do with the Stealth Up, they just increase defense (and potentially allow for a set bonus). The maximum Stealth Up is level 3 as you can see by the icon in the menu, so the three pieces of the Stealth set gives you maximum Stealth Up and there's no benefit to adding any more past that."
41584,"You can only use one of each of those at a time. They're meant to be for temporary, short-term goals"
41634,Keep in mind you can get a chest sensor.
41806,"It normally acts like any other weapon with 40 durability, but when it runs out it comes back in 10 minutes real-time. It powers up when near Ganon's malice, and gains a huge durability boost to 188, but can still run out of energy.

&gt;Can it ever permanently break?

No"
41933,"&gt; Hearts are more helpful late game than tons of stamina.

I disagree, you have so many defensive and healing tools late game that more hearts barely make any difference. You even have a free auto-resurrect every 24 minutes (or 8 with the expansion!). Having more stamina to climb or run or do slowmo shots always feels better"

44275,The main quests are treated with importance and are in their own section of the adventure log. That's where you'll be getting all the story
58586,"That meal heals 10+3 hearts. The heart with the ""10"" means 10 hearts."
60577,"You can leave horses wherever in Hyrule and they'll be fine, as long as you've registered it. And you'd be able to warp it to any stable. If you haven't registered it, try finding stable nearby, or just give up on the horse"
65265,"Just go to the guy at the counter and select ""Take horse"""
65409,"&gt; When is the Champion's Ballad meant to be played?

Any time after freeing the Divine Beasts, which is when it becomes available."

131162,"&gt; Like is there any way to know the stats of a horse before you catch them?

No, but solid-color horses have higher stats than spotted horses. You can spoil how to get the best horses, or what the stats of a given horse you've caught are, with [this guide](https://www.gamefaqs.com/switch/189707-the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/faqs/74764/normal-horses)

&gt; Can you train them in any way to raise their stats?

No, raising their bond only makes them obedient and allows you to change their gear.

&gt; Also, how does level/power scaling for enemies work? Will they only get stronger as I get stronger, or is it determined by what area they're in so enemies in region X will always be Y strong?

[Here](https://redd.it/6ghtvz) and [here](https://redd.it/7nf1iq)

tl;dr enemies and equipment both get stronger as you kill more varieties and quantities of enemies"
136952,"&gt; There is now enough Spirit Orbs to max out your hearts and stamina.

False"
141970,"And how many hearts and stamina do you have? No matter what there are two slots of either hearts or stamina missing.

&gt;she said that I had sufficient power and did not need to increase it further

The statue said that before the DLC came out too, when you had three slots missing"

Chests do not respawn whether in shrines or the overworld unless they're on Eventide."
200258,That is also not true.
234404,"There's [a speedrun category](https://www.speedrun.com/botw#Master_Sword_RTA) for exactly this, maybe watch one of the runs?"

471967,"To be clear, when you go to System Settings -&gt; Users, there's two users there?

Each of those users has their own saves per game. All you have to do is select the correct user when starting software and it has its own saves."
472014,"It's not possible to be holding a broken weapon. Once it's broken it's gone, *then* you can get a replacement. You could just lose it, too"
472062,"&gt; Dropping the trident won't work, you'll have to wear it out on some bad guys till it breaks.

Not necessarily true, you can drop the Champion weapons somewhere and as long as they no longer exist in the world you can get a new one"
479698,"You can't repair it, you can only forge a replacement. And again, when a weapon breaks, it breaks. It's not possible to have a broken weapon in your inventory, so not sure what you mean there. And again, you can just drop it (or break it) then get a new one"
485118,Notice how they live on the surface? That probably means that they're not the type of animal that can live underwater. King Dorephan is also concerned that it could affect the rest of Hyrule

570391,"Look in your Key Items inventory and read their descriptions. These items and their descriptions also popped up on your screen when you freed the Divine Beasts, so in general you should pay attention to menus and text."
570416,Describe it in more detail? Or if you're on Switch take a video capture of it the next time it happens
570493,"No, there's no way to play in a post-Ganon Hyrule, so it'll always be in your adventure log as the end goal. Your save file having a star on it shows that you've completed *Destroy Ganon.*"
570614,"Ask around in Hateno Village, there's a construction company with a quest for you."
586231,"What do you mean? You collect the scale from the ground after you shoot it off Farosh, then it's just not in your materials inventory? Or do you do something with the scale?"
586302,"It wasn't an actual quest in your adventure log, and the reward was just a Warm Doublet which there are several ways to get. Return to that cabin on the Great Plateau and he will have left it in a chest for you, if you didn't get it from him another way"
