9306,"I'm not much of a gamer, but this game is wicked challenging for me! To the point that I don't think I'll actually finish the whole game out of frustration. 

The timing for blocks and dodges has to be tooooo perfect, the enemies have way too much health, even just enemies that casually pop out of the grass. The flipping bats are infuriating. A mild test of strength? I used up basically everything in my inventory on that. The weapons breaking mid-battle is insanely frustrating.....

Challenging is good, but I want my difficulty level setting so that I can just explore the game and storyline with a little less frustration.

edit: oh yeah, ""question"" - how do you get good at this game? :)"
