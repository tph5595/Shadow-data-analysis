The stamps number about 100, and it’s up to you to figure out a useful system for them. I used the treasure chest one to mark really good ore deposits, the skulls to mark lynels &amp; hynox. . ."

Your problem may be that you can only have one user account for a Switch console.

But there is an option to add additional user profiles and then your son could start a game from his own profile which will be completely separate from yours. I have 4 profiles on mine with Zelda games I've played thru, but only one could be associated with my Nintendo account.

My take is you should play the game as originally designed without the DLC so that if you replay it with the DLC it'll be a heck of a lot more interesting. That's how I did it and I'm never wrong . . . ~grin~

So it all depends on how likely you'll replay the game and how bored you'll be if the replay is exactly the same as the first time."
469487,"One of those things where it depends on where you are in the game. 

The gems come in handy to upgrade your armor and upgrade certain weapons, but if you don't have the armor, or weapons that requires the gems for upgrade or you don't have all the fairies for the upgrade, then you're better off cashing in those gems so you can buy armor. 

Gems aren't that hard to come by and you'll always stumble on ore to break. One tip I didn't find out until I'd played for several months is that 10 luminous stones can be bartered for one diamond at a certain location. A pretty good deal considering how hard diamonds are to find. . ."
526476,"Actually, I just looked up the ancient armor upgrade and they require Guardian parts, cores and for the 4X, a star fragment, so mea culpa. 

But I think you're right in that the Circlets require gems for upgrades but I preferred the Ancient Armor and the Barbarian Armor so I never got those.

I may have been thinking of weapons that can get repaired, they usually ask for a diamond "
