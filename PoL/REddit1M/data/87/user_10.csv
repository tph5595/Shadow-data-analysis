24834,"A silly question that will save me time, I’ve completed about 20 shrines... is there ever a treasure chest hidden behind the monk pedestal (where you collect the spirit orb)?

I’ve ran round it to check every time and if there’s over 100 shrines that’ll be a lot of wasted seconds if a chest is never there :)

Thanks"
