154358,"* I have finished all the Quests in Kakariko and found the first memory at the Gate. Now I am kind of lost, what would be a good point to continue? Go back to Hateno for quests and shrine hunting (I am at 6 hearts right now)? Also hope to get a hint from random strangers to where I can find the next memory?

* I have found several ghost like animals. One seems to appear on the way to the great fairy fountain near Kakariko village. As soon as I get close it will run away, disappear and then appear again to run away again and disappear completely. After a few days it re spawns. First I thought it was a Korog but there no Korogs in that area according to the many guides. What is the point of this ghost animal?"
