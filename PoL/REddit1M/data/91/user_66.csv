I can't wait to feel the same way about botw in 20 years... oh wait, there's basically no music in botw :("
25885,"Same.  I gotta get the 3ds one some time.  I remember getting a bunch of masks as a kid but not really being sure where to go and stuff.  I don't think I ever even owned it, just rented it a few times.  Remember the days when you had to start from scratch every time you rented a game haha"

I know they're probably doing some tie-in with the online subscription, but I can't wait any longer!"
30576,I haven't got there yet.  I've been trying to draw out the adventure for as long as possible.  But I'm sick of the tinkling piano music.  I have to hum / whistle the real Zelda music as I play to keep myself sane lol
