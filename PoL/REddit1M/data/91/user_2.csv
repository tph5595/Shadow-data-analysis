4257,I've still never finished Majora
47464,"Oh don't get me wrong, I adore the whole thing. I bought it several years ago, but the whole three day thing gets me all worked up and stressed out so I never get very far. I've been on the intro to the stone tower temple for like the past five years. I just never seem to have the mental energy to pick it up again. I'm also 90% done with twilight princess but I've beat it before. Ocarina I've been able to play all the way through since before I could read: the joy of watching older siblings helped me memorize the whole thing a long time ago."
