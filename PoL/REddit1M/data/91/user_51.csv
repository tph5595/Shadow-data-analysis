Mario 64
Zelda Ocarina of Time
Zelda Majoras Mask
DK 64
Mario Kart
Mario Party 2
Goldeneye
Starfox 64
Diddy Kong Racing
Pokemon Snap
Paper Mario
Kirby and the Crystal Shards
Mario Golf
Mario Tennis
Jet Force Gemini* (never played it, but it shows up on best lists)
Perfect Dark * (never played it, but it shows up on best lists)
Banjo Kazooie 
Banjo Twooie (i think there are licensing issues with the Banjo games, so we wouldn’t likely see them)"
35295,My brother and i would beat the crap out of each other in Smash Bros!  We could play it all day!
