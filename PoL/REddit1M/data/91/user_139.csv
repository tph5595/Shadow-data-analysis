55459,Maybe that's what he meant and assumed OoT was 64 mb also?
55520,"As a kid it scared me and i havnt played since, but i know i should. It sucks that i barely have time to beat BotW"
55638,"BotW doesnt have the same charscter development and story. Its an amazing game by nearly every metric but it doesnt have the same vibe oot and mm had. It might even be a better game, but like you said 12 year old me will always have a special place in my heart for oot and mm."
55734,Wait are you agreeing with him or disagreeing. Because this commenter doesnt like the fact that op had a different opinion on the beginning yet you are stating the opposite. Im confused.
55814,The fact that the game made you feel so much with midi music is what makes it amazing!
56222,I feel you 100% homie. Botw has led to some poor choices on my part but totally worth it.
56240,"Awesome, can you link me to how?"
