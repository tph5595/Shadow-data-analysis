27081,"Virtual Console via HDMI or component cable (red&amp;blue&amp;green&amp;red&amp;white) will come out looking pixel-perfect when you set your TV or console to 4:3, but a real N64 running the same exact game to a composite (yellow&amp;red&amp;white) cable can’t do that. Most HDTVs don’t know how to cleanly put together the lines of the picture from an old console, so you get a zippery/Venetian blinds artifact all over the entire picture all the time. You might not notice it some of the time, but when a room like the Temple of Time is supposed to look clean and sharp, all of those straight vertical lines will look jagged and toothy."
