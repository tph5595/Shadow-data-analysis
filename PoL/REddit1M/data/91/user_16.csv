10586,"GLHF, try and beat the world record of 17m 9s "
19557,"Literally the world record is 17m 9s, https://www.speedrun.com/oot#Any 
you can watch the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ijxmQfediEc

note: this is any% fastest time to beat Ganon, the WR for 100% (this includes all items, all hearts, all songs, all equipment etc.) is 4h 10m 43s 

another one to look at is Glitchless which has an extensive rule list but basically excludes and major advantage gaining glitch e.g. infinite slide, going out of bounds, using the wrong warp glitch (used in the any% video) "
