23955,It’s amazing. Hands down one of the best games ever. Tops every other Zelda game out there. 
24372,"Definitely. I recommend some second hand apps like letgo. I’ve seen a couple of switches in my area for 300-350 that come with the console, 2 controllers, and atleast 2 or 3 of the big games, Mario kart, Mario odyssey, and Zelda. I must say though if you get a switch and Zelda, the pro controller is almost a must. It makes the game so much better. "
28042,"Well of course it’s an opinion. I’ve always loved open world games. I love the fact that this is an entirely non-linear Zelda game and the capabilities of it are just awesome. Totally agree I can’t claim this is just the best game ever, but to me it is one of the greatest. I love OoT and Twilight, but this is just on another level "
