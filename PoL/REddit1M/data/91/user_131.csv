35700,"My man, do yourself a favor and change the aspect ratio back to 4:3 like it should be. 

Edit: Oh nvm literally the first comment is about the aspect ratio this is surprising"
35811,People don't generally have an aunt that played N64 nor call N64 'old school'.
36318,God this is obnoxious. Even subreddits about asking questions and getting help on homework have rules that tell you to make sure you aren't asking things that can be answered with a simple Google Search. When did this happen? I swear it's only around these last two years that people started defending people asking basic questions rather than the people telling them to Google it.
36627,"And let me guess, you're the one that downvoted me?"
36750,Lmao yea that looks stupid. Maybe some shitty phone autocorrect thinking its a sentence?
39682,"I think you're confusing me for the guy above (Edit: Wait, actually, no, the guy above has more upvotes than you), I only have one downvote. Way to have intelligent conversation by the way; can't make an opposing argument without shooting someone with a downvote. Also, you're assuming people guessing someone is young is automatically an insult, which is strange. Are you sure you're not the one with something against people's age?"
46117,"Again, you must be assuming I'm someone else. Unless you think it's rude to say aunts aren't generally in the age range for N64 or that concluding someone as young based on what they consider old enough to be classics is somehow insulting."
46382,"""Your tone""

""Stop being condescending""

&gt; Spams downvotes on disagreeing opinions

Are you this ignorant to yourself or what?"
46802,"You have a real twisted sense of rudeness if you found ""People don't generally have an aunt that played N64 nor call N64 'old school'."" rude, much less ruder than your sarcastic ""You know, people of most ages have an aunt. I'm 25 and I have several."" Do you just like calling everyone who disagrees with you rude? Again, you earlier accused me that my rudeness was based on me insulting OP for being young, which I did not do. "
