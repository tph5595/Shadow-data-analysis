The moon gets closer and you feel the pressure of having to finish a quest, be in the right place at the right time, or finish a puzzle in a dungeon before the world ends. I remember feeling a bit anxious at times throughout the game, but thats what keeps me coming back.

This being said, I would still choose OoT over MM. It just has a special place in my heart."
