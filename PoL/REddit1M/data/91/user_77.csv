28117,"Right there with you!~. (For now) my favorite Zelda game is skyward sword~ (I know it isn't ""the best"" but it has a special place in my heart for different reasons) but even with that said, I really want to experience that feeling again... But I don't want to ""override"" the experience of skyward sword,
You know wattamean?... I keep bumping into reviews and ""game off the year"" sites (because I keep browsing reddit, and the Nintendo reddit), scrolling down super fast to not get any spoilers xd... I had a WiiU before but had to sell it because of... Well, the same ol' story of not having money and stuff (not gonna ramble) *inhale* buuuut what I wanted to say is that... I really hope you have a great adventure when you get to play it~ 
I shall wait with you
(p.s. I made a cardboard switch because I really want to play botw... I know, very childish, but one can dream~; you can check my profile if you want to see it, I don't want to link it 'cause I don't wanna be pushy~)
