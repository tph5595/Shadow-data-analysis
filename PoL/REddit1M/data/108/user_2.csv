41946,I'm playing through The Adventures of Link at the moment and it's so much more harder than the original lol. But After playing for a while and learning the tricks it's not so bad.
42257,I'm just a sucker for floating islands and sky worlds and all that kinda of stuff. xD
42577,"I loved MM but I did find the time mechanic annoying at times, and rather intimidating when I was younger. I always felt if I couldn't do everything in it's time frame then I'd fail over and over and get frustrated. I know it's not as bad as that, but I didn't like not being able to take as long as I liked in just playing around."
