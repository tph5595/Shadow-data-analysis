25111,"I would say it's the most visually stunning game I've ever played, and as far as exploration of the map goes, the most immersive Zelda I've played, by far. I can play this game for 8 hours straight and not do a single thing that I set out to accomplish. I often just stop somewhere and look around and just appreciate the beauty and atmosphere of this game.

Also, the physics is super consistent and enjoyable. I was trying a press a switch in a shrine somewhere, and accidentally lost the only barrel I had. I decided to drop my Boulder Crusher onto the switch, almost just as a joke, and it actually pressed the switch down! The game is masterfully thought out, and an amazing accomplishment.

All that being said, the game falls short of perfect in a couple areas for me. Firstly, the dungeons are too short and easy, and the bosses at the dungeons are wayyy too easy. Compared to how unforgiving the overworld combat is, I'm honestly pretty shocked that I beat the first two dungeon bosses in under a minute each, without dying once. The dungeons themselves are interesting and creative, but just as I'm starting to appreciate them, it's over. It's hard to believe that they worked so long on this game, and put so much thought into it, and the dungeons are so underwhelming. I understand wanting to rewrite the Zelda formula, but with the physics engine available in this game, there is such a massive potential for extremely creative and fascinating puzzles and boss fights that the developers really dropped the ball (er, orb) on. I've done about 60 shrines, and there have only been 2 or 3 where I've really had to just stare at it and think really hard about what the hell I'm supposed to do. I can only hope that the DLC coming out is going to give us some real dungeons. Additionally, I'm pretty bothered by the recycled aesthetic of the shrines. With so much thought into the map, and the different environments and ecosystems, for them to make all 130 shrines look the same seems like a serious oversight.

I also must say, the story in this game, though it's interesting, is pretty damn boring (sorry, guys). Well, maybe it's not that it's boring, but it's just that the entire story is basically laid out in the first few hours of the game, and there are not any new developments. Now, I'm not finished with the story yet, but I am already sure that I'm not going to learn anything new. Zelda's holding Ganon in the castle, you need to go help her beat him. There are four divine beasts that would be helpful in the fight, but you can also go fight him right now if you feel like it. That's it. No plot twists, no suspense, no mystery, no real intrigue or plot development whatsoever. It's basically just ""Oh yeah, Ganon's over there, go fight him when you're ready.""

Where this game shines is in the gameplay, not the content. I really hope that this is the start of a new era for the franchise, because as beautiful as the game is, and as impressive as the gameplay and overall scope of the game's ambition are, all I can really see by now is a lot of missed potential. This is the first Zelda with real physics, and the puzzles so far have essentially been ""here, this is what you do, now go through the motions, and not a lot of ""now how on earth am I supposed to get this thing over there????"".

All in all though, I believe the game deserves its 10/10 rating, if only just because of its polish and perfection compared to any other game I've ever played. In other words, if any game out there deserves a perfect score, it's this one. It seems that just because the game is so close to being perfect, the aspects where it falls short become even more glaring.

Now before anyone gets too mad, just know I'm writing this on my lunch break at work, and I'm counting the minutes until I get to go home and pour another 8 straight hours in tonight, and I have tomorrow off too, and I can't fucking wait.
