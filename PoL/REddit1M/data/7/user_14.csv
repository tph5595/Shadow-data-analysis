2825,"I have't finished it yet however I did hit all of the towers and 74 shrines without a guide.  I was surprised at how absolutely large the game is.  I knew the map was going to be huge, but I didn't expect to spend 8 hours in the Great Plateau alone, and countless more in Necluda before finally branching out to explore other areas.  It was 3 days before I finally did my first Dungeon, which was Vah Ruta.  Now just yesterday I've finished exploring Hebra to the point I'm comfortable doing, and rode south to the Gerudo Desert.  And even if I complete it today, I still have to explore all of Faron, explore northern hyrule *outside* of the korok forest, and explore the coast."
