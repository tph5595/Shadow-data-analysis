1410,"So last night after getting about 60 shrines, obtaining the Hylian Shield, the Master Sword, upgrading my armor to rank 2, cooking up ten 15+ extra heart meals, uncovering the whole map, and discovering every memory, I decided to fight Ganon. (All of this only put me at about 15% completion)

I have to say while the fight was cool it wasn't my favorite Ganon fight in the franchise (that still goes to Windwaker), but that just made me realize that this game really is all about the journey.

I was a little disappointed that you can't continue on after defeating Ganon, I was really looking forward to roaming around in the now cleansed Hyrule castle. Instead you just have to reload to your last save before the fight to continue exploring the map."
2031,It makes me wonder if you'll every really be able to get that 100% counter on the map screen to 100/100%... Even if you complete everything you'll still have the Defeat Ganon quest incomplete..
2197,"From what I've noticed, after defeating Ganon your save file gets marked with a star and you just have to reload to the autosave right before the fight at the castle steps."
