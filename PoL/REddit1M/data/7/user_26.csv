6565,"I had one of the most amazingly organic open world gaming experiences that I can recall last night! I was toying around with the shield surfing mechanic which I had just figured out how to activate about 10 minutes prior, when my low durability shield breaks and sends me rag-dolling forward. I tumbled into a hole in the ground, and lo and behold this hole leads to a huge cavernous underground area. I barely manage to catch myself with the paraglider right before I hit the ground, and glide right into a sleeping overworld boss. Have a super epic fight and notice that the boss was guarding a boat load of ore, which I then mined for a huge rupee pay off.

Totally unscripted! Moments like these are going to keep me playing for years"

I haven't activated the tower yet in that area so I don't know any in-game names, but I wandered there after heading southeast from Hateno. The holes that open up into this cavern are on these coastal cliffs and pretty close to a minor test of strength shrine that's at the tip of a really sharp cliff. You can see the particular shrine from Purah's place if you use your Sheila Slate scope."
