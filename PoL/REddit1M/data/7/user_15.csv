7127,Love the music. My favorite so far I think is the guardian theme which is that kind of electronic theme that's tense and gets you into the moment really well.

10331,"i kind of hear it, its like the minor chord version of it. Also that's not the theme i was thinking of. Damn it. I know it starts when you face mini guardians, like in the ice shrine this techno theme starts. It pops up a few more times throughout the game...Now I'm not sure what it is. "
