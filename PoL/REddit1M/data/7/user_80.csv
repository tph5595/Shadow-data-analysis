However, I had a lot more trouble with the Rito dungeon's boss than the Zora's dungeon's. The Gerudo dungeon was the longest dungeon by far (as long or slightly longer than both the Zora and Rito dungeons combined), and it also had the longest quest to enter the dungeon. Overall, of the three I've done, I'd say the Gerudo dungeon is my favorite, then the Rito dungeon, then the Zora dungeon. I'm heading over to Death Mountain after work to do the Goron dungeon. 

Overall, though, I'd say that as far as actual dungeon design goes, I'm definitely enjoying the dungeons a lot. I like that they're more puzzle-focused, since the rest of the game gives you a lot more opportunity for combat than other Zeldas did, so I don't feel that the dungeons needed more combat than they have. All three dungeon bosses I've fought have been super sweet, and looking stuff up on them after the fact, I've found multiple really cool strategies that made me feel like an idiot for not realizing they worked and exploiting them. The only problem I had with the bosses is that I was too well geared for them, since I had the Master Sword before I entered any dungeons, and even though I didn't use it I still had tons of hearts. I definitely want to do a second run of the game where I mainline the story instead of going shrine-hunting, so that I can have really tense, difficult boss encounters. That said, the boss of the Gerudo dungeon is really, really hard (he did like 8-10 hearts of damage to me per hit), and the only way I was able to beat him was by learning his timings and parrying him to death.

Before I read it, I didn't have a very high opinion of King Rhoam, but after reading it I at least understand him better as a character, and while I still don't think I like him I get that he was put between a rock and a hard place, and I think he made understandable choices, even if they weren't choices I would have made."
