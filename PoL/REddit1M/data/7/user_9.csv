1863,"So I learned I really enjoy the game most when I don't open my map. When I first opened the game I turned on pro HUD and never looked back. On my 2nd play through I haven't discovered any towers and it makes the game a lot more adventurous, requiring me to remember where to go or explore using the details NPCs say. I will use fast travel to towns occasionally but I try to avoid it unless I need arrows, sell crap, or to finish a small quest. 

I learned there is enemy scaling with the game. I have 2 characters, one with 15 hearts and one with 4. I go to the same enemy camp that I haven't been to on either camp and the character with 15 hearts has much tougher enemies, the chest drops better loot, and the enemy has stronger weapons.

I like that there is some scaling to keep the game challenging but when does the scaling stop where I can keep getting stronger (more hearts/stamina) and the enemies stay the same? Trying to figure that out now. 

By the way I'm 60 shrines in, 2 dungeons, and 150~ koroks. "
2011,"Damn I've been playing about 10 hours a day and at 60 shrines and 2 dungeons. But I have almost 200 korok seeds, finding those guys is almost my favorite part of the game. "

15807,I wonder if that is true. I read it was based on how many hearts you have. That's why when I went from 8 to 13 hearts the enemies immediately got tougher.

41222,Rock circle = find. Rock nearby and place a rock where there's a missing one within the pattern or in the center.
