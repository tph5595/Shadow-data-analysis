33115,I agree completely. The moments where you crest a hill or mountain and start walking through waist-high grass toward a shrine/tower/interesting looking object on the horizon and a tiny little piano trill dances across your ears before the birds and crickets continue makes me feel like I am living in a Miyazaki film.
