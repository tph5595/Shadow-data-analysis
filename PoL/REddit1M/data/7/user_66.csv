17715,"As everyone has said, this game is incredible. The versatility that it provides to each players style/gameplay is superb. It forces you to learn all the tools you have at your disposal and be creative to advance Link and the story. With that said, you are doing yourself a huge disservice if this is the first Zelda game you are playing. I saw a couple days ago someone posted the charts that showed the increase of activity to this subreddit since BOTW released, and it made me think, ""how many people are playing Legend of Zelda for the first time with BOTW?!?"" If you are one of those individuals I urge you to find a way to play, at the very least, Ocarina of Time. BOTW pays a humongous tribute to the events, characters, and detail that OOT provided many years ago. 

My only tip would be if you're having a hard time advancing in the story, just go wander into new areas. You will likely find challenges there too, but you'll also find stronger weapons and means to upgrade Link."
