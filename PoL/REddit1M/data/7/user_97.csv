Also, I've got to say some of the puzzles in this game are super clever. Like when Kass sings the song about 17 of 24 or something like that, and you have to wait until 5:00pm and use the rock you're standing on as a sun dial/compass. No cheap quest markers pointing you exactly where you need to go or anything. (I still haven't completed this quest yet, so I'm not 100% positive that was the right solution, but damn I felt like a genius when I figured that out)"
