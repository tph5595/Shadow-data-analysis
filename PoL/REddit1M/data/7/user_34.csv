P.S. These threads will be made up to 75 hours. Though you can experience the game in any order and with this much time you may have been able to explore possibly everything not everyone moves at the same speed in the same amount of time. After the 75 hours thread we will have an ALL SPOILERS megathread for a couple of days. 

**You can potentially beat this game in 45-50 hours. So all comments below may be discussing the END GAME AND ALL PLOT POINTS.**"
