2517,"Can we all take a moment to appreciate the sky?

It's often overlooked(or should i say underlooked) in video games, but I spent a few minutes yesterday just looking up, and the clouds are all very realistic, always moving, and doesnt look repetitive. Not to mention when storms come in, you can catch some very cool sky images.

I just imagine when designing the video game, someone was kind enough to put a decent amount of effort into making the sky look amazing"
