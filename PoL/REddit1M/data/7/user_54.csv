13504,"I personally am still waiting for my Switch to get here in the mail, but based on the open world gameplay I've seen, I feel like a lot of the game would be wasted without durability, because one of the main drives for exploration is the chance for new, stronger, undiscovered weapons, and if people could use the same weapons forever, they wouldn't be quite as desperate to explore new locations and look for new ones

This wait is killing me.. 2 more days max, but I'm hoping it shows up early.."
