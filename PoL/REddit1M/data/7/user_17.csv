4348,I've had a few surreal moments while exploring to see two different  dragons flying over head. After desperately running to get close and shoot it with my bow it dropped a scale. Super conveniently without any prompt from a side quest or guide I came across a goddess statue looking for that very scale.
6216,Glad I could help! Dumb luck worked for me!
