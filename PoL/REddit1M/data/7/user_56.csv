14498,"The only issue I have is with the whack combat music. It might not be ""bad"" but it is definitely out of place and imo a bad choice for music played during combat. I think I have heard 2 tracks, one is good its upbeat and has a serious tone to it and another one is straight up random piano stuff thrown together that totally takes you out of the zone."
14601,I'm torn on where to go for my 2nd beast. I was originally going to go to Death Mountain but I feel like exploring the North West side of the map where the Rito race is. I've just been running around aimlessly doing shrines and puzzles.
14874,"Horizon Zero Dawn has been very awesome as well. It doesnt have as many puzzles and min dungeons and stuff but the setting with viking stuff, technology and robot dinosaurs was on top for best open world game but I think Zelda is slowly taking over."
14935,As someone who grew up playing OoT and Majoras Mask this game is striking all the right notes. It really is a love letter to those of us who have played the previous games and have fond memories of those games.
15011,Zora was my first dungeon as well and it was fun. I thought it was a bit short. I kind of like dungeons that were a bit more fleshed out and took longer to complete. I hope the 3 other ones have a bit more meat to them. Only reason I am not too disappointed is because of how much there is to do outside of those divine beast dungeons.
15089,I keep running from those every time I hear one creeping up. I am now at 9 hearts and did my first divine beast. I think it may be time to go back and see how hard they are.
15152,"Well if you read carefully they will tell you to offer a ""insert dragons name here"" scale into the spring which will then open up a secret passage to a shrine. "
15424,"One of the coolest experiences for me so far was going up onto snowy peak north of Hateno Village and witnessing the dragon that sits atop. The encounter that followed where you have to cleanse the dragon was something really fun.

Another thing I am enjoying is just the way you can improvise in this game. Equipping a flame rod and warm doublet to combat cold, even up on the peak with the dragon was enough to not need food or elixirs to combat the cold. The lightning storms, several different ways to solve a puzzle. It may not be the most polished best looking game out but it surely is filled with pure enjoyment and sense of wonderment/mysticism that I haven't felt since I played Ocarina of Time and Wind Waker when I was younger."
15501,I didn't either at the time but I saw him floating around close to one of the cliffs I was standing on and just shot a couple arrows and then realized he dropped something. I also got hit with one of his electric orbs...ouch. Glad we don't have to kill him.
17441,Yeah I have been watching a couple of my favorite streamers on twitch play here and there and I mainly want to go to the Rito area because that ability just seems like it would make the rest of the game that much easier to get around.
22408,I have killed a Lynel so I guess I shouldn't be too worried during the fight.
22471,"I just put on a warm doublet and a fire rod and I was able to climb to the peak of the snowy mountain north of Hateno Village with no food or elixirs or extra clothing without getting cold. I wonder if it's worse than that.

Also a side note. You can shoot blue chus with any elemental arrow to make them drop that colored jelly. So shoot Chu's with a fire arrow for red jelly, shock arrow for yellow and ice for the white jelly. Hope that makes it a bit easier to find :D"
24010,I would definitely prefer a more memorable melody playing while just out in the open world. It's a bit too quiet at time. I am glad some of the major areas have a distinct tune that is reminisce of older titles.
24042,Oh I never thought about just dropping jelly and lighting it. Good tip.
24105,"you have to remember there are 900 koroks (at least that's what I have heard several times from random sources), I bet they make up a sizeable chunk of completion. Not sure how many you have gotten so far."
24747,"I keep completely forgetting about the Master Sword. I wish the weapon system in this game was handled a bit different. There is a such a disarray of progression. I mean sometimes you get stronger weapons it seems sometimes you get enemies that drop weaker ones. The progression path isn't really streamlines other than the armor, hearts and stamina. I miss the more linear progression/upgrade path (not exploration or story). I digress though, glad to hear about the later dungeons."
36838,"Oh damn lol, I am at 70 or so right now. I can't believe there are hundreds because they should literally be everywhere you step.
"
36891,Those mid air shots make fights so epic. I wasn't using that for the longest time but I have started to lately and they are so cool. That sounds like a truly epic ending to a fight with those guys.
