8597,I know there is rock boss there.  I'm sure there are some Korak Seeds there too.  
9885,"Last night I did the Eventide Island Shrine, this is all the way to the east in the water.  To get there you either have to take a boat, or ice jump your way there (that's what I did).  First note, save before you reach the island, just outside of it.  Once the Island Shrine quest begins, you will not be able to save on the island.  If you fail, you will have to go back to your last save.  This quest you have to put three orbs in three different shrines on the island.  They take away all your items and you have to find weapons &amp; food to beat the island.  I died several times trying to beat this.  So I tried to out smart the system, I threw my Ancient Battle Axe, with a 60 weapon damage onto the island and picked it up after the quest began.  There was a giant that kept kicking my ass, so I threw a weapon to beat him easily.  Once I put all three orbs on each shrine, I got all my weapons back but wasn't able to keep any of the weapons i had found on the island.  Note, if you want to clear this island similar to how I did, drop any weapon you want to return to your inventory before you place the third orb.  Then you'll be able to keep your weapon.  Learn from my mistakes.  "
