5149,I won't worry if you can't find those locations yet. If you remember playing Zelda then their locations are pretty obvious. Hard to miss honestly.
24933,If it's just to handle the desert then all you need is an ice weapon. If it's fire proof armor (death mountain) then you need fireproof elixir made from fire proof lizards so you can buy the armor from Goron city.
25136,The shrines become really hard to find after 40 for some reason. Even with the sonar on there seems to be a lot of hidden shrines. I suspect I need to talk to a lot more NPCs but exploration is too much fun
60880,Just lizards and yes
1213972,I know how you feel. 26 and in college. Still at about 65 shrines and each one becomes more difficult. I was watching a video and I've missed 2 towns completely. One I found by accident the last playthrough. Maybe I'm not as through as I once thought.
