24216,"This is more of a 5 hour moment, but on release day, when I was playing with a friend, we actually decided to crouch on one of the cliffs on the plateau just to watch the entirety of the sunrise. It was pretty amazing, considering very few games actually put effort into that.

And I just saw my first shooting star just yesterday! :D"
25808,"I spent a solid hour on getting on the Akkala tower today. Avoiding the guardian helis wasn't hard at all(climbing the cliffs instead of taking the front door ftw), but I got seriously stuck at the sea of goop up there. Found one goop eye by accident, spent a good hour looking for other ones. In the end, I *did* find a way up the tower, but man, that was an adventure. A fun one though.

Then, I finally made my way to Robelo, and on the way to get some blue flame, I actually stumbled upon a full-blown labyrinth, where I killed my first guardian(yay!) and scooped up some sweet, sweet loot before cheating the labyrinth by climbing up the wall (twice) to look for an entrance to the shrine. The rewards at the end were well worth it though.

Then, I killed my second Lynel(first one was at Zora's Domain, for the heck of it). This one was at the skull pond in Akkala and went considerably faster than my first despite having 3000 HP instead of 2000. Enemy knowledge seriously pays off as I actually used my trade mark spear weapons this time instead of the safe sword 'n board solution and actually snuck in tons of extra hits. Pretty proud of that one. Found the monster merchant on the same trip.

All in all, I did tons of exploring in Akkala this time around.

I'm actually surprised how well this game holds up. In Xenoblade X, the huge amount of side stuff and exploration would actually burn me out, but this game just fuels my desire to play more, explore more and find more stuff every time. 

And the world is purely enjoyable. A fun side episode in my adventure inspired by this sub includes making trees fly and almost getting crushed by them(also almost crushing the Akkala stable's shepherd dog in the process), as well as flying a short way on a raft before crash landing it into the lake upside down. Octo balloons are octowesome.

EDIT: Also took some of my most used pieces of armor and painted them green to get the sort of Link look going. Surprisingly, it actually did change my feel for the game a little."
63267,Did that after I noticed a weird glow where it fell. :] Turns out I had seen the *glow* before but didn't follow it. First time seeing it fall down tough.
