16904,"So I just finished the game, with all main missions to get the secret ending scene.

Honestly I found the final boss to be pretty disappointing. I get that he can be easy because I have good gear but still I didn't even do that much side stuff and I still murdered him.

I think my biggest gripe is the last phase tho. It just stands there doing nothing ready to be murdered. It's supposed to move but it doesn't feel like it. It's supposed to use attacks but it never targets you. It's just meh. I was expecting a final showdown as a sword duel like in the last 2 3D Zeldas now but it just never happened. It just ended like that. 

Honestly the Vah Ruta battle was similar to the last phase and was executed much better IMO.

That said the FF style summon is pretty cool and the music is epic I guess. Also seeing the final phase makes you go wow, which I guess makes a strong impression until you realize how easy it is, which is half the fight given how fast he goes down.
