5430,THATS what those statues were asking for?  Damn I can't wait to go home and play now
5528,I feel like they took the default wallpaper from Windows XP and build a whole world around it.

27331,What's crazy is there's a whole generation of kids that will eventually grow up to be game developers and they'll use this game as their benchmark.  I'm jealous of the kids I don't have yet!

Now I work 60 hours a week, go to college, and have a wife that I really can't blow off to go on a 10 hour game bender!  I gotta make it count when a game I like comes out!"
