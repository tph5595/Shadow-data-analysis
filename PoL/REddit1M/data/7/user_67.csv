18116,I would definitely prefer more music every now and then. 
18426,"My one big complaint (having just entered Vah Ruto, my first dungeon) is this dungeon schema. One of my favorite parts of Zelda is the dungeon lore. The ancient shrines, prisons, castles, temples, buried in the element they represent--going into the bellies of fish (...which granted was always pretty bizarre), onto ancient pirate ships, down into the places people haven't ventured in centuries, each with their own style and theme, was always fun. Going into four old robots lacks that mystery, a bit. 

Though... This is based purely on having just stepped into one of them. Will be happy to be wrong. "
42901,Yeah that's really too bad. Feels like the game's only real miss.
