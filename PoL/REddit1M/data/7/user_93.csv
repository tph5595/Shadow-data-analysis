35627,"I had one of the most epic video game moments of my life fighting the Lynel on top of Polymous Mountain (to get the shock arrows before the first dungeon).

I had him down to just a little bit of health when he hit me with one of those fire breath attacks. I dodged to the side, jumped into the updraft of the fire to glide up, slow-mo nailed him with an ice arrow in his eye, then slammed my two-handed weapon down as I landed back on the ground, killing him.

All this took place in 3 seconds, and I have no idea how I did it.


I love this game."
