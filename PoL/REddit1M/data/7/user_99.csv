39074,The Bard guy mentions that the music he plays at the stable incorporates a theme from the song that the ancient hero uses to call upon his horse :3
40324,I'm yet to notice it.  Anywhere in particular that it strikes up?

I was busy so ignored it, but your comment just made me put 2 and 2 together."

Notice the Elixers you get up there are ""Flameproof"", not ""Heatproof"".  I suppose it's pretty easy to overlook the distinction, but the devil is there in the details.

40951,"I took a completely ""wrong"" path to Death Mountain the first time I tried to get there, scaling rocks from the East.  As a bonus, there was a memory up there that I found, but it was such an ordeal, and I finally got in range of the tower and then I started burning and I just had nothing on me to prevent it... so I had to turn around, head back down to my horse and back to the stable, and plan a new approach.

That will be a great memory that sticks with me about this game."
