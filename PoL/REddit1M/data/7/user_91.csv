It's decent.

I don't really care for the *massive* open world. Open world is a meme and it's gotten tiring. People say ""there's so much to do!"". So far I've been running around and climbing mountains more than anything just to find a shrine that's over in 2 minutes. Side quests vary from fetch quest to not bad. The tools suck. There's absolutely 0 sense of progression. There's very little sense of reward. The ""dungeons"" are horrible. ***Ubisoft Towers*** XD. The music might as well not exist. The framerate on WiiU (for a game originally designed for WiiU) is atrocious. Fighting a boss or doing a ""dungeon"" at 15FPS sure pleases my eyeballs.

Combat is pretty standard Zelda but the enemy variety kills it. The world looks nice at times, at least. "
