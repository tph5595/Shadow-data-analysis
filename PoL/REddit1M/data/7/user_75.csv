22301,Foothills stable is my favorite. They have the stable theme with an accordion playing over top. I hung out there for a couple minutes just listening
24305,"* I die a lot, usually in comedic ways. I find myself saying ""Oh, God dammit"" in Dee Reynolds voice quite a bit.

* I think I may have found a glitch to exploit. I noticed that I was getting a bunch of 5xarrow drops during the Zora quest, likely because the game wanted me to have arrows during the boss battle. So I was curious and fast traveled to the Great Plateau and all the Bokoblin archers were dropping 5xarrows, as I assumed they would. I don't know if I'm imagining this or not, but it makes sense.

* I also noticed that if you ditch missions and fast travel somewhere else while they're going, it makes the Blood Moon Glitch more likely. (in my experience) I think it screws with the game's clock when you do that.

* I can't find the 10th chicken for that moron in Hateno. I feel like Billy Madison in this scene: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TFHs7AyBA20

* I appreciate everything Mipha is doing for me, but she definitely gives off the over attached girlfriend vibe.

* I saw a dragon for the first time at that huge bridge over the lake. It was beautiful and I felt bad shooting it with an arrow. But even the arrow arching through the air and into his back was beautiful as well. I love this game.

* I'm currently obsessed with Towers and Memories. That last memory is going to be freaking impossible. It's just a picture of the forest!!! I'm hoping I'll get a clue at some point.

* I keep getting my ass handed to me at the Ridgeland tower. I really don't like those wizard guys. First, because they're a pain and second, their character design feels kind of out of place in this world. I wish they weren't in the game.

* I love this game!! Been playing for about 50 hours and really haven't completed anything. Pretty sweet."
