I mean there's a scene where the character is literally balling her eyes out and her voice actor is just like \*talking in british*. She just sounds so .. off. Her pacing and tone rarely matches the scene, or just makes her feel out of place. 

WHY does zelda have a british accent when her father doesn't? Or literally anyone else in the world? "
