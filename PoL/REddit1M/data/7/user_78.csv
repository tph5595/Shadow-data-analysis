23829,"One of my favourite tracks is the Hinox theme, just because of how absurdly out of place it is compared to the rest of the music. It's such a sparse and wonderfully thoughtful soundscape and then all of a sudden you have a bizarre almost golden age of Hollywood style take on Indian music. It's ridiculous, but somehow perfect for every Hinox encounter.

It also wins a prize for having the least amount of over used stock bird calls, a good 60/70% of the bird calls I haven't heard anywhere else, which is stupid rare for games.

(Also just a small pet peave, no one in this thread is using the word minimalist correctly. Minimalist is a specific genre and composition style that mainly focuses on repeated sound structures developing over time, which BotW doesn't really have. The word we should be using is minimal, or atmospheric at a stretch)"
