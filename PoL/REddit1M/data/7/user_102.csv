46044,Really depends on what you want to do. There's a ton of sidequests so you could do that first. Or complete Link's memories. Or maybe complete your Compendium. Collect all Korok seeds perhaps. The list goes on...
46787,I'm 30+ hours in and I only finished the Vah Ruta missions. I don't want to do main quests just yet. Hahaha.
47426,I really love the Korok Trials. :') The Lost Pilgrimage was a bit of a pain but everything is fun in general.
