There are a few things I'm not a fan of (motion controls in shrines, frame-rate in some areas) but those are minor gripes and overall this is the most enjoyable single player experience I've had in a LONG time. I'm sitting at work absolutely itching to get home and play until I go to bed.  There is just so much stuff to find and do. Time absolutely flies when playing this game!"
