1514,"I decided to head to Goron City after Zora's Domain. I found Lanayru Tower, floated down to the stable (which was a lucky coincidence since I was actually going for the shrine), and accidentally ran into the woman who sold me fireproof elixirs.

Fast-traveled to the tower, floated down, fought the guardian for longer than I should have. I realized that blowing up a bomb underneath it flips it over while stunned, which makes for targeting the eye with arrows a little easier.

Climbed the mountain all the way to the Bridge of Eldin, but got confused because I couldn't find Goron City. Forgot that I could turn on the waypoints and pins, which helped. Cursed myself for being an idiot.

Floated down, purchased the tunic and pants, and decided to call it a day after that. It looks like I have to find Yunobo today."

What helped me with the chicken in Kakariko is heading up the hill by the shrine and taking out the Sheikah Slate (or your camera) and scanning the land. My tenth one was on one of the roofs.

I'm more of a Mac ""God dammit. GOD DAMMIT."" lad myself, though, ha.

I also liked Mipha's story. The memory with her was very sad. She did have some super clingy vibes, but given how much she loved Link and knowing that she didn't get to lead the live she had hoped for, I felt a little more connected to her.

There's an NPC who can assist you with memory locations, although his hints aren't always the best."
