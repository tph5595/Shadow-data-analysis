Personally I'm comfortable with my Wii version so today's news doesn't affect me, but I am worried as to what this means for Zelda U.

FYI extra dungeon in a remake has happened before: Color Dungeon in Link's Awakening. I think someone playing that game for the first time would want to play the Color Dungeon for the full experience."
