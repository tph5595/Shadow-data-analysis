55122,"60 dollars is a lot for an HD port

like, a lot more than any other HD port from any other company
"
55190,"there is a standalone version

it's cheaper, but t's the only version they're making after the special edition is finished production. Then you have to buy the amiibo separately for the usual price

"
55416,"it's content rich, but it's also old. you can buy the original for 20 bucks and still play it on your wii u, and now one of the features that would have justified the higher price is locked behind certain bundles or buying a toy

"

"

"
57067,"it's added content for a very high price

it's already an expensive HD remaster, at 50 dollars (60 with the amiibo)

also, in situations in the future where you can't get the amiibo... the content is just gone
"

yeah

it's ridiculous
