63077,"Does anyone care that ""dungeon"" was a rough translation? I really think it's more likely that this Twilight Cave will be more like a side quest than a traditional Zelda Temple. ""Dungeon"" can mean a lot of different things in different languages, and only has the significance it has to Zelda in english. Nintendo hasn't pulled the kind of dlc shit EA has, and I don't think they're about to start. "
