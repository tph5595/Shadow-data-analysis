24826,"&gt; Still gonna buy it. Yes, the amiibo too.

You are **part of the problem**.

If you don't want Nintendo to keep making this shit (and putting it in all *new* Zelda games from the start instead of just remakes), DON'T GIVE THEM MONEY WHEN THEY DO IT.

Do you seriously think that if this is successful, Nintendo **won't** make it so the same amiibo unlocks a dungeon in Zelda U?  They've already said they plan cross-functionality."
24905,"This better not unlock a dungeon in Zelda U.

I don't want TPHD.  I should be able to play Zelda U, 100% of it, standalone.

But everybody over on /r/amiibo is lapping this up, so I have very, very weak hopes."
30114,"...No, I cared about other games doing it - that's why I didn't play them and play Nintendo games.

Limited editions of games fucking suck."
31108,"&gt; It'll probably come as standalone DLC for the same price of an amiibo anyway

Yeah, hopefully.  That's still on-disc DLC which is shitty."
34590,"Fair point, but I really consider those two games to actually just be one really big ~$90 game."
47261,"Yeah, I've had several interesting conversations with people about how the DLC should cost $13, because obviously most of that isn't going toward the manufacturing, shipping, and retailing of those figures..."
48177,"[Case in point](https://www.reddit.com/r/amiibo/comments/40wsis/wolf_link_amiibo_unlocks_new_dungeon_for_twilight/cyylbp4)

&gt;Without content, they're just overpriced figurines. I'd pay $2 or $3 for one."
49341,i'll probably just eschew everything else and find a deep dive MMO at that point tbh
51673,"&gt; There's no real precedent for an Amiibo doing the same thing in two different games.

Nintendo has stated that the wolf will unlock something in Zelda U **based on data saved to it in TPHD**, however.  That is the cause for worry."
52163,Considering the precedent to unlock a dungeon has now been set by that selfsame amiibo?
52210,"Maybe I'm wrong, but I seriously doubt they'll be able (or want to) keep an amiibo in stock for multiple years.

Nevermind used copies.

Or digital.

This is the problem with on-disc DLC."
