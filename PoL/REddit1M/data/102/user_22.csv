23958,"Well as it currently is, it is a series that should be associated with multiplayer. The single player in Four Swords Adventures was fun, but not even close to what it is in multiplayer and clearly isn't built around single player (no minigames, force gems, and therefore exploration, is almost completely pointless). The marketing was mostly built around the mutliplayer aspect. The DSi version of Four Swords is even more of a rush - it's not much fun at all in single player. 

I think most people were aware that it had a single-player mode, but it's also pretty obvious it's a multiplayer focused game. I don't think including an additional multiplayer mode called ""Four Swords"" in a single player game destroyed the brand or anything. It's more that people aren't buying multiplayer-centric games when they don't have the means to enjoy them the way they're meant to be played. If all your friends didn't have GBAs, playing Four Swords Adventures was expensive!"
