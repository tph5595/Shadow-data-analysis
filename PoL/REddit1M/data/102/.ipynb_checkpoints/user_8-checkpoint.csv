10044,"More like, finally the amiibo is needed to have the complete game"
32403,"Yeah, let's Forget the fact that remaking a game is way less work and yet it is probably still gonna be pretty much a full price title.  

Just wait till we start unlocking entire extra features with amiibo sets, then know that it is this lax attitude that caused it."
32423,Original TP is not TP:HD.
33664,"&gt;
I don't go into McDonald's and kick up a fuss because they charge extra for bacon on a Big Tasty. 

Difference is they don't deliver that Big Tasty with the extra bacon in a little safe box which you need to buy a 13 dollar key for to unlock, despite it being part of the meal you bought."
33917,"The point isn't the price, it's the fact they are making you pay for a physical ""key"" to unlock content that is already on your disc.  

whether it is 60 bucks for the dungeon or only 85 cents, it doesn't remove the fact that it is no different from day-one on-disc DLC."
34416,"&gt;
This is absolutely day 1 DLC, but that doesn't make it exactly the same as all other day 1 DLCs. Compare it to, say, SW Battlefront, where the base game is incomplete and you have to double your purchase cost to get the other half of the game. This is far more reasonable in comparison.  

why ?  
Cause it's Nintendo doing it ?  

&gt;
Fact remains, if they weren't going to charge for it, they wouldn't have made it. So would you rather have no extra optional dungeon, or one that you have to pay for? 'I want the extra stuff for free' isn't a realistic answer.  

I never said that.  
I want them to not lock meaningfull content behind amiibo with no other way to get it.  
if that means no extra dungeon then so be it.  

But thinking they can't or would never make a new dungeon except for with the amiibo is idiotic, OoT:3D had the boss battle mode added in and that didn't require anything.  

The Color Dungeons in the gameboy Color games didn't require a physical plastic toy to unlock shit  
Four Swords Anniversary Edition didn't lock the ""past levels"" behind a penny and a dime."
44273,"&gt; 
&gt; Urmm, no. We're talking £5 to add extra content to a complete game vs £40 to add on half the content of an unfinished game. It should be pretty obvious which one is better value.

It's the same practice.  
Getting hit in the stomache by gorilla swining at full force is a lot worse then getting smacked across the face by a soccermom, but that doesn't mean the soccermom is in the right.  

&gt;
It's optional. If you want it, buy it, if you don't, don't. What you're essentially saying here is 'I don't want to pay for it so I don't want anyone else to be able to either.' Personally I want to play a new dungeon, and I see no reason why Nintendo should have to give me that for free, so I'm happy to pay because £5 is basically nothing.  

""optional""  

it is on the disc.  
When I buy the game, it is part of what I buy, except I'm not allowed to access what is already on the disc I bought unless I pay extra on something.  
What's next, let's lock away bottom of the well in OoT unless you pay money.  
it's optional, it's cool.    
Let's make you buy your way into the spider houses of Termina one at a time, **NOW WITH 10% DISCOUNT IF YOU BUY THE SPIDER HOUSE PASS**  
  

&gt;
Those features all require far less manpower and money spent than a new dungeon. The closest thing we have there is the colours dungeon, which is on a 2d game and likley took far less effort than what we'll see in TP. WWHD is really the only fair comparison game and that got nothing new except a faster sail.  

This is speculation on your part.  
the Anniversary edition got 3 new levels which all had completely redone assets for each time period.  
I doubt the twilight Dungeon will be completely changing the look of everything in the game.  

As far as we know right now, it could just as easily be cave of ordeals in the twilight realm or something.  

.

Tell me, if Zelda U has a dungeon locked behind an amiibo, or even two.  
will that be ok ?  
What if they attach the note : ""these dungeons wouldn't have existed without the amiibo, cross our heart hope the die and so forth""  

Then the next game can have a seperate dungeon for each amiibo, and soon enough each amiibo will unlock a sage dungeon and not having the LoZ set will make you only able to save Zelda, but in order to fight and defeat Ganon you need the special 8-bit gannon amiibo.  
etc...  

.

Amiibo should not lock content away from games( especially not if the games don't rely on the amiibo as their main ""thing"", and those are a whole new argument)."
45175,"You can access everything in each of the Oracle games without owning the other one though...  
All you'd need is to find a code online to start a linked game.  "
45224,"Also, same price as amiibo would be a pretty insane pricing consdiering you wouldn't actually get the amiibo for it."
45305,"He could be referring to older consoles.  
The wii only had a single zelda game on it if you bought TP for the gcb."
45601,"It's still way easier to get a code somewhere then to make sure to get access to a physical thing that will almost certainly be quite limited.  

Also, the oracle games with essentially 2 full independant games with a bonus for having both.  
this is locking content behind a little plastic figurine."
46915,"&gt;
Content that didn't exist when the game was made,   

The content clearly exists as the game is being made.  
TP:HD is coming out with that content locked away.    

&gt;and possibly wouldn't have existed without the figurine (given how little they've added to the last 3 remakes).  

Meaning it is content they are adding for the express purpose of locking it behind a paywall, yes that makes it a lot better I'm sure.  
"
47901,"&gt; Are you honestly comparing extra content in a game to a punch in the face? I want one of these things, I don't want the other.

I am comparing LOCKING CONTENT BEHIND A PAYWALL (on-disc content I might add) to getting punched in the face, neither of the two is acceptable by anyone that is thinking about the future of the industry without fan glasses.  

&gt;These are both parts of the main game. This dungeon wont be. We know this, because we've already played the main game, and this dungeon wasn't in it. This is extra.  

It is part of the full game, you have not played Twilight princess HD.  
you have played Twilight princess (normal and/or mirror edition)   
It is just as much part of the ""main games"" as the optional side quests like the spider houses are.  

&gt;
Of course that wouldn't be okay, because they're taking away from the full game. As we've already established, base TP is already a full game. When you played TP for the first time, did you every think 'this feels incomplete, I haven't had my moneys worth'?  

No, you have established this in a futile attmept to have a reason to defend shit practices.  
that content is part of the full game that is : ""The legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess HD""  
It not being in ""the legend of zelda : Twilight Princess"" is irrelevant to that.  

&gt;
This is just some 'slippery-slope' bullshit. Do you really think the dungeon on TP will be required to complete the game? If and when this happens (spoiler: it wont), I'll be complaining just as much as you.  

Slippery slope shit is **EXACTLY** how the gaming industry has turned into the money grubbing, content locking, day-one-dlc-selling, early-access-paid-beta-testing bullshit it is filled with now.  

Why would you tell, and even defend/praise Nintendo for standing at the top of the slippery slope with one foot on the slide when the result is bad for everyone involved ?!?  

&gt;
If you'd rather have games with less content be my guest. Personally, I'm quite happy with my ability to make concious decisions about DLC. If I don't think something is worth it, I just wont buy it.  

Yes, that is really fun, until it starts affecting the games.  

&gt;If there's something I do want, I will. If it's on the disk or not makes zero difference to me. I'm not going to be angry that a business is trying to charge me for extra stuff. They're not our friends. They're trying to make money. It's the way of the world  

and this is why the world is shit.  
congrats.  
no really, thank you for being the type of person that allows people to starve and be exploited and the like because ""that's how the world is right?!?!""  

&gt; I've got nothing against DLC of any form, as long as it's not overpriced, and the base game functions as a complete product.  

13 dollars for a single cave is not overpriced ?!"
49220,"Always remember Serb, when we lie downtrodden in the mud and they start complaining about Nintendo locking the Temple of Serenity behind an amiibo of Sage Ramos for Zelda NX or whatever, they themselves are the reason it led to this.  

but until then, we can atleast keep trying to prevent that darkest of timelines.  "
49893,"Man, that would be great, especially if he comes with a big fish he is holding that has a minifridge in it filled with soup."
50474,"&gt;I'm going to bed, so we'll have to agree to disagree. It just seems like you're making mountains out of molehills. The fact that you're comparing an optional £5 DLC package to starvation and human suffering just shows how hysterical you're getting over this,    

it's called a comparison.  
not everything you read needs to be taken at face value.  

&gt; . Yes, in a perfect world, we'd get extra dungeons for free

I never said that.  
I said that content shouldn't be locked behind amiibo

&gt;Accept that the industry has changed, because complaining about it on the internet sure as hell isn't going to change it.  

jep, you are what is wrong with the world.  
""accept that companies will screw you over because that's how the world is gonna be now""  

Also, you are being silly if you think ""complainging on the internet"" is all I'm doing about it.  

&gt;
That aside, the game without the amiibo will still be worth the price (unlike SW Battlefront). That's what I mean by 'full and complete'. Ask yourself this. If game X had released without any DLC, would you have been disappointed in the lack of content? If the answer is 'yes', then charging extra is unjustified, in my opinion. That's how I see it at least.  

Locking content that is on the disc away is always unjustified.  

&gt;
I don't know about the exchange rate but here it's £5, and yes, it's totally worth it. I get an extra dungeon, 

One, and probably one like cave of ordeals or the like, as opposed to an actually designed dungeon like the temples  

&gt;an awesome figurine which I would have bought regardless,   

Yes, and now imagine games doing that for amiibo you don't care about.  
still fun ?  

&gt;and some mystery content in Zelda U - all for less than the price of a sandwich and a drink. It's nothing. I'd pay twice that much.  

Dear god, just, everything that comes out of your ~~Mouth~~ fingers is just protections and corporate ass kicking while presenting your ass to Nintendo to sodomize isn't it.  

&gt;
If it's not worth it for you, then don't buy it. Contrary to what you seem to believe, they're not forcing you to do anything. And they sure as hell don't owe you any free extras.  

I never said anything about being forced.  
however, you are ""forced"" to buy the amiibo in order to get all of the content in TP:HD.  
Contrary to what you think, just cause it is Nintendo and not EA doesn't mean they aren't performing shady business practices.  

Goodnight, honey.  

&gt;
I'm going to bed, so we'll have to agree to disagree  

you know the internet doesn't leave while you sleep though right ?  
You don't need to wrap up a written converation cause you are going somewhere."
51193,"&gt; Stop being so shitty, you're starting to get on my nerves.

I can see we are being polite and levelheaded here.  
Always nice to see.  

&gt;This started off as an interesting conversation, but now that you've started taking my difference of opinion as a personal slight, I'm getting sick of you. You need to learn how to have a debate without having an argument - it would make you a more pleasant person. Since we've passed that point...  

I still find it an interesting conversation, i just don't belief in self censorship for stuff that is clearly not even an issue for you.  

&gt;
I'll enjoy my extra dungeon, you enjoy being a whiny self-righteous savoir of the industry. I'm wrapping up the conversation because you're a pain and the last thing I want is to have to wake up to more of your bitching in the morning.  

ok, you enjoy eventually waking up in a world where 75% of a game is locked behind additional purchases that are ""*extra bonus content*"" \*wink wink nudge nudge\*  

Goodnight once again.  "
56434,"No it doesn't.  
In NA they only have the bundle available, but in other regions there are both bundled and solo game options.  

not to mention people buying digital."
56842,"Windwaker was cheaper because it was a remake, and the same is true for TP , so no, that isn't true.   
The full price of Twilight Princess HD is the stand alone version without an amiibo.  
The amiibo version has you paying extra to also get the amiibo.  

The content is amiibo-locked all the same.
"
57490,"The game itself without amiibo **IS** 10 cheaper.  
it is 50 stand alone, and then the amiibo bundle is 10 more expensive.  

So yes, my bad, it is 10 you are paying for that locked content assuming you are buying the bundle, not the stand alone game and the amiibo seperatly.  

it doesn't change the matter at hand though.  
TP:HD's full price (Stand alone) is 50, not 60"
58491,"&gt; 
&gt; Yeah, and the average price for a video game is 60, not 50.

That is irrelevant.  
it is priced for 50, not 60.  

And there is a reason for it : because it is a remake, so it was a lot less work to make, and they don't expect people to pay the price of a new game for it.  

&gt;
Look, I agree with you, content gating is dumb, on-disc DLC is dumb. I think Amiibo should be relegated to cosmetic content only, and I think especially with the troubles they've had producing them, there should be other (and cheaper) means of accessing the content. But getting the game plus the Amiibo for the standard price of a game is a great deal, and even if you break them down to their individual costs, you're still saving $3, so it's really hard to see this as some kind of rip-off.  

The rip off is not int eh amiibo bundle.  
it is the fact stuff is amiibo gated, and if you really think that is dumb, then you wouldn't be defending their decision to do this.  

is this cave itself a big deal /  
probably not that much.  

however, the amiibo gating has been getting worse and worse, and personally I'd rather send word to Nintendo how I feel about this (and try to tell people to think about what this actually is and do the same) NOW, then wait until entire sections of games or entire characters are locked behind amiibo."
59687,"&gt; 
&gt; It's really not. You're arguing the game itself should be standard priced at $50 and thus the $60 version is an above-average price. It's not. $60 is the standard price of a video game. Yes, most HD remakes are a little cheaper. No, they don't have to be.

The game is 50.  
that is the price Nintendo put it on, just like they did with WW:HD.  
If anything, I'M not arguing that has to eb the case, Nintendo itself is, cause guess what, that is the price THEY THEMSELVES put on the game.  

&gt;
Well, ignoring this being a slippery slope fallacy, I don't really see Amiibo as being all that different from standard DLC. It kind of rings of ""it's okay to charge $20 for some maps in Call of Duty, unless it's in the form of a $13 figurine."" The only problems I have are in the limited quantities (which even now aren't as big of a deal as they used to be) and the future-proofing, but there's a simple solution to that (release it like regular DLC in the future).  

I don't think any of those other day one DLC shits are ""okay"" at all.  "
63036,"No dude.  
it's real simple.  50 is the price for the game.  
60 is the price for the bundle including an amiibo (normally priced 13) and the game (normally priced 50)  

There is no big ulterior motive or planning in that pricing.  
THAT'S IT.  
That's the price of the fucking game.  

&gt;
Day one DLC is absolutely okay. When you finish making a game, it has to go through QA, certification, printing, and shipping. That usually takes weeks to months. In that time, the devs are usually working on bonus content. They're not going to just sit on finished content and not release it because ""day one DLC isn't okay.""  

Very little (paid) day one DLC is actually made in between the game going gold and it releasing, that's a fucking fairytale and you damn well know it.  
But yes, I mostly meant paid on-disc dlc.  

&gt;
That said, I'm assuming you meant ""on-disc"" DLC and not day-one DLC, in which case I agree, it's lame as hell. I like Amiibo because I like the figurines themselves, but as a DLC model, I'm not sure I like it. It's a little different from Infinity and Skylanders in that it's not content locking for just one game, but for multiple. On the other side of the coin, you have people upset that they're paying $13 for DLC that doesn't really unlock much. I think Nintendo has to tread a fine line between releasing too much and not enough content behind DLC. Personally, I think the solution is to give the option of having any Amiibo content also available separately from Amiibo, especially when it's on-disc stuff.  

i agree on this part.  
and that exactly is the issue with (what we currently know of )the situation with this amiibo support in TP:HD."
63869,"&gt; 
&gt; Then I guess we disagree on which is the ""nromal"" version of the game. Considering they don't even sell the Amiibo-less version in they're biggest market, I'm arguing the $60 Amiibo bundle is the ""normal"" version and you have the option to pay less to get it without one, not the other way around.

Every market except NA put together is bigger then NA.  
so the majority have the game for 50, with the bundle for 60  

also, I heard from someone in NA that the bundle is called a limited edition, which implies you guys will get standalone edition as well, meaning it will be the same deal for you guys after a while too.  

&gt;
That's a pretty big accusation to posit, I'd be interested in seeing if you have any sources on the majority of day-one DLC being 100% confirmed to be finished at the same time as the base game while the developers apparently sit around doing nothing for months yet somehow still have jobs and can pay their bills.  

games don't go gold for months on end in general dude, and most of the time spend inbetween end of development and release is spend on bug fixing and the like.  

&gt;
What we currently know is actually nothing. Amazon France posted a sentence they later deleted. Literally nothing has been officially confirmed.  

You know well enough what I meant mate, no need to hassle for using the wrong terms.  

fine, here you go : ""If what we assume right now based on amazon france's removed statement is correct then.... etc..."""
66892,"&gt;
Except every area also has the bundle available...  

but it isn't the standard for the game itself anywhere.  
the simple fact remains that the price of the game : 
The Legend of Zelda : Twilight Princess HD"" is 50, not 60 like the bundled option  

&gt;
It isn't. It's officially called ""Twilight Princess HD with amiibo"".  

""with amiibo"" AKA the amiibo is considered something that is packed with the game in that bundle.  

&gt;
Not trying to hassle you, just pointing out it's a little early to be upset about how this is going to affect all future Nintendo games; we don't even actually know how it affects this one.  

In the same way, no way to defend it yet.  
everyone in this thread is basing their words on the scenario we have ""sketched"" based on what amazon france said.  
it doesn't require specification."
