If it wasn't a remastered game, then I could see it, but TP was already a complete game when it first came out and we're getting new functionality in this version. What I do understand is the concern over availability of the amiibo. Amiibos are physical products and subject to scarcity and demand dwarfing supply, unlike digital DLC, plus buying the digital version of the game doesn't come with the amiibo for somewhat cheap, unlike the physical version. IMO, the Twilight Cave and whatever else comes with the amiibo should be downloadable online, with amiibos becoming toys that come with a free copy of the DLC, instead of the only way to get it."
