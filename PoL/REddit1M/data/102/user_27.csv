25622,"What are you talking about?  The game IS complete. This isn't some dungeon they created years ago during the original release only to decide to hide it behind a pay wall 10 years down the road. They're literally creating an EXTRA dungeon for the existing game. If anything it's paid DLC. Now you could argue that the amibo may be hard to find thus inconvenient for some people, but don't sit here and pretend that somehow creating new content for a decade old game is somehow the same as stripping out content from the original in order to sell an ""uncomplete game."""
