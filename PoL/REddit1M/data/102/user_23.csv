23196,"True, but they're also collectors items. That's mainly why I get them. Wasn't planning on getting this one, but a new dungeon is pretty enticing, plus it's confirmed to have functionality with Zelda U somehow so it's an easy buy for me. "
23356,"WWHD didn't have any extra dungeons. It's not a requirement. It's extra, and 'extra' takes time and work. I've got no issue paying extra for extra. "
33057,"Regardless if how much work it took, I've got no issue paying full price for a full game. Likewise, I've got no issue paying full price plus some for a full game plus some.

Why would they take the time to put in an extra dungeon if a) nobody expected or asked for one, and b) they aren't getting paid to do it? Answer: they wouldn't.

So really, the options are an extra dungeon you have to pay a tiny bit extra for, or no extra dungeon at all. Which begs the question - why are people complaining because they've been offered more content? 

I don't go into McDonald's and kick up a fuss because they charge extra for bacon on a Big Tasty."
33870,You have to take price scaling into account. A dungeon is more valuable than a strip of bacon. A video game is more valuable than a burger. 
34269,"This is absolutely day 1 DLC, but that doesn't make it exactly the same as all other day 1 DLCs. Compare it to, say, SW Battlefront, where the base game is incomplete and you have to double your purchase cost to get the other half of the game. This is far more reasonable in comparison. 

Fact remains, if they weren't going to charge for it, they wouldn't have made it. So would you rather have no extra optional dungeon, or one that you have to pay for? 'I want the extra stuff for free' isn't a realistic answer. "
42398,"&gt; why ?
Cause it's Nintendo doing it ?

Urmm, no. We're talking £5 to add extra content to a complete game vs £40 to add on half the content of an unfinished game. It should be pretty obvious which one is better value. 

&gt; I want them to not lock meaningfull content behind amiibo with no other way to get it.
if that means no extra dungeon then so be it.

It's optional. If you want it, buy it, if you don't, don't. What you're essentially saying here is 'I don't want to pay for it so I don't want anyone else to be able to either.' Personally I want to play a new dungeon, and I see no reason why Nintendo should have to give me that for free, so I'm happy to pay because £5 is basically nothing.

&gt; But thinking they can't or would never make a new dungeon except for with the amiibo is idiotic, OoT:3D had the boss battle mode added in and that didn't require anything.
The Color Dungeons in the gameboy Color games didn't require a physical plastic toy to unlock shit
Four Swords Anniversary Edition didn't lock the ""past levels"" behind a penny and a dime.

Those features all require far less manpower and money spent than a new dungeon. The closest thing we have there is the colours dungeon, which is on a 2d game and likley took far less effort than what we'll see in TP. WWHD is really the only fair comparison game and that got nothing new except a faster sail. "
47349,"&gt; It's the same practice.
&gt; Getting hit in the stomache by gorilla swining at full force is a lot worse then getting smacked across the face by a soccermom, but that doesn't mean the soccermom is in the right.

Are you honestly comparing extra content in a game to a punch in the face? I want one of these things, I don't want the other.

&gt; ""optional""
it is on the disc.
When I buy the game, it is part of what I buy, except I'm not allowed to access what is already on the disc I bought unless I pay extra on something.
What's next, let's lock away bottom of the well in OoT unless you pay money.
it's optional, it's cool.

These are both parts of the main game. This dungeon wont be. We know this, because we've already played the main game, and this dungeon wasn't in it. This is extra.

&gt; This is speculation on your part.
the Anniversary edition got 3 new levels which all had completely redone assets for each time period.
I doubt the twilight Dungeon will be completely changing the look of everything in the game.
As far as we know right now, it could just as easily be cave of ordeals in the twilight realm or something.

They're still just rehashing old assets though aren't they, not creating something new. But you're right, we don't know for sure if this dungeon is worth the price yet. But, if as I imagine, it's a full dungeon with a boss and everything, then it's definitely worth it for me. If it's just a Cave of Ordeals thing, then people who can't justify spending an extra fiver aren't really missing out on much anyway.

&gt; Tell me, if Zelda U has a dungeon locked behind an amiibo, or even two.
will that be ok ?
What if they attach the note : ""these dungeons wouldn't have existed without the amiibo, cross our heart hope the die and so forth""

Of course that wouldn't be okay, because they're taking away from the full game. As we've already established, base TP is already a full game. When you played TP for the first time, did you every think 'this feels incomplete, I haven't had my moneys worth'?

&gt; Then the next game can have a seperate dungeon for each amiibo, and soon enough each amiibo will unlock a sage dungeon and not having the LoZ set will make you only able to save Zelda, but in order to fight and defeat Ganon you need the special 8-bit gannon amiibo.
etc...

This is just some 'slippery-slope' bullshit. Do you really think the dungeon on TP will be required to complete the game? If and when this happens (spoiler: it wont), I'll be complaining just as much as you.

&gt; Amiibo should not lock content away from games.

If you'd rather have games with less content be my guest. Personally, I'm quite happy with my ability to make concious decisions about DLC. If I don't think something is worth it, I just wont buy it. If there's something I do want, I will. If it's on the disk or not makes zero difference to me. I'm not going to be angry that a business is trying to charge me for extra stuff. They're not our friends. They're trying to make money. It's the way of the world. I've got nothing against DLC of any form, as long as it's not overpriced, and the base game functions as a complete product. "
49988,"I'm going to bed, so we'll have to agree to disagree. It just seems like you're making mountains out of molehills. The fact that you're comparing an optional £5 DLC package to starvation and human suffering just shows how hysterical you're getting over this, and I have no desire to get wrapped up in your mania. Yes, in a perfect world, we'd get extra dungeons for free, but we're talking about a company here, they're not trying to do you a favour. Accept that the industry has changed, because complaining about it on the internet sure as hell isn't going to change it.

That aside, the game without the amiibo will still be worth the price (unlike SW Battlefront). That's what I mean by 'full and complete'. Ask yourself this. If game X had released without any DLC, would you have been disappointed in the lack of content? If the answer is 'yes', then charging extra is unjustified, in my opinion. That's how I see it at least. TPHD passes the test (assuming it hasn't had any features cut).



&gt; 13 dollars for a single cave is not overpriced ?!

I don't know about the exchange rate but here it's £5, and yes, it's totally worth it. I get an extra dungeon, an awesome figurine which I would have bought regardless, and some mystery content in Zelda U - all for less than the price of a sandwich and a drink. It's nothing. I'd pay twice that much. 

If it's not worth it for you, then don't buy it. Contrary to what you seem to believe, they're not forcing you to do anything. And they sure as hell don't owe you any free extras. 

Goodnight."
50981,"Stop being so shitty, you're starting to get on my nerves. This started off as an interesting conversation, but now that you've started taking my difference of opinion as a personal slight, I'm getting sick of you. You need to learn how to have a debate without having an argument - it would make you a more pleasant person. Since we've passed that point...

 I'll enjoy my extra dungeon, you enjoy being a whiny self-righteous savoir of the industry. I'm wrapping up the conversation because you're a pain and the last thing I want is to have to wake up to more of your bitching in the morning."
