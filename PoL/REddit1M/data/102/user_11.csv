12962,"Yeah, I can't say I'm upset about this. The original TP was one of the most content-rich Zelda games we've ever had, and all of that will be available in an enhanced form no matter what copy you buy. Creating an extra dungeon unlocked by the bundle most people are going to purchase anyway seems fair.

I hope they make it available another way for those who can't find the amiibo (as a buyer of the amiibo, I won't even complain if that other way is free), but I can't feel that Nintendo is being unfair here. No one is being cheated in any way. People were perfectly content with the price they were planning to pay before this news. At least with Nintendo we still get a full game to start with, not a half complete game with the rest of the content as DLC for another $60.

Besides, we don't even have confirmation from Nintendo yet. This may be a ""the amiibo unlocks it any time you want, while others can unlock it simply by beating the game"" sort of thing, assuming it even exists at all."

18161,Haha true. I didn't get to play that game until it was free on the 3DS eShop years later and I finally got to play through it with a friend.
18374,I'm glad that was the last time they made a multi player focused game without single player. Even the 3DS release had it.
