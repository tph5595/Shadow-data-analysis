The game can be bought with the Amiibo bundled together for the same price as the normal game. So you don't have to spend additional money and get the Amiibo on top of it. I just pre ordered in on Amazon and the Amiibo is included.

Also, I think it is awesome they added content to a remake of an old game. Up until now we thought it would be a regular remake but they designed an enitre new dungeon for the game. Which is awesome!
 
It is still the same game with imropoved graphics + hero mode except there is an additional dungeon now if you get the Amiibo.

So they took nothing away, they only **added** content, which you can get at the **same price** if you choose to. 

I mean it is logical people would prefer free but I think it is cool they added content."

I don't know what the regular prices are where you live and how it compares to Wind Waker HD. Wind Waker HD has/had the same price where I live as TP except you get additional content and and Amiibo with TP.

I hope you are an angsty teenager if you can't bear other people's opinion without feeling the need to insult them. It sucks that the prices differ so much from region to region but don't blame the ones who can get it for a reasonable price."
