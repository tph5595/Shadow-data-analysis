17423,"No, the ALttP remake had Four Swords. Which is even harder than Hero mode because you need a friend with the game. Toughest challenge I've ever faced in a Zelda game."
18237,Same.
18467,"Definitely. Sadly, though, the lack of single player for that probably ate into the sales of FSA on gamecube."
23164,"But the Four Swords bit was pure multiplayer. So when they come out with a new Four Swords game, people think that it too will be pure multiplayer."
24163,"No, I've seen a fair number of people (myself included) be legitimately surprised that FSA had singleplayer. The original Four Sword's lack of any sort of single player definitely had a negative impact on the sales of FSA for that reason. Multiplayer-centric or not, more people would have bought it if they knew it had single player, and they would have known that had the original Four Swords not colored their perception."

45945,"Content that didn't exist when the game was made, and possibly wouldn't have existed without the figurine (given how little they've added to the last 3 remakes).

Also, how is this not a ""little bonus"" for owning the figurine? It's certainly less than in the oracles."
