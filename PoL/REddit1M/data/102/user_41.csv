51547,"The Bowser (?) Amiibo unlocked a new game mode in Mario Party but didn't do anything special in Mario Maker. The Fire Emblem Amiibo unlocked characters in Code Name Steam but not Fire Emblem Fates. There's no real precedent for an Amiibo doing the same thing in two different games.

Honestly, this seems more geared toward getting people to buy a port of a decade-old game than to boost Amiibo sales (hence the game coming with the Amiibo and the fact that you can't even buy that Amiibo separately anyway at the moment).

Hopefully whatever the case, they release any content as separate DLC anyway (or at least make those Amiibo cards). Content gating is stupid (and this is coming from someone who pre-ordered that game as soon as I saw the Amiibo)."
51918,"Hopefully someone corrects me if I'm wrong about this, but as far as I can find, it's not a limited edition. The standard physical edition release comes with the amiibo, period. They're out of stock right now, but that doesn't mean it's a limited edition; more should be on the way. As far as I could find, only the UK version lists a ""limited edition"" and that's because it also comes with the soundtrack and in a different box."
52016,"Yeah, but there's a huge gap between ""unlock something"" and ""unlock an entire new dungeon."" Every single Amiibo unlocks something in Hyrule Warriors, for example, but it's just random items like rupees.

I get the worry though, I just don't think there's enough precedent to assume it'll be something as large as a dungeon."
55926,"Well it hasn't been confirmed that it'll do that in Zelda U, so no, that's not setting a precedent unless it gets confirmed otherwise.

What I'm saying is the same Amiibo has never done the same thing in two different games before, so currently, there's no reason to assume this one will."
56305,"The Amiibo comes with the game at no extra cost, though."
56661,"Okay, but the point is you don't ""need to pay $13 extra"" to get the bonus dungeon because you can pay literally the regular price for the game and still get it. The game plus Amiibo is regular price, the versions without it are discounted. It's literally the opposite of paying extra to get extra content; you pay regular price to get all content or you pay a discounted price to get like .01% less in your game."
57188,"The full price of TP is $60, the same as the full price of basically every game. You're only paying ""extra"" if you assume the game should be $10 cheaper than regular price just because a different game was. Either way, you're not paying $13 extra for anything."
57307,"Yeah, though I think that doesn't exist in North America (where I am) so I wasn't aware of it, my bad."
58078,"&gt;TP:HD's full price (Stand alone) is 50, not 60

Yeah, and the average price for a video game is 60, not 50. So for the same price as any other video game, you're getting the game and an Amiibo. You have the option of getting the Amiibo-less game for $10 less, but it's really hard to skew getting the game and an Amiibo for standard video game price as ""paying extra."" It looks a lot more like ""game plus free Amiibo"" to me.

Look, I agree with you, content gating is dumb, on-disc DLC is dumb. I think Amiibo should be relegated to cosmetic content only, and I think especially with the troubles they've had producing them, there should be other (and cheaper) means of accessing the content. But getting the game plus the Amiibo for the standard price of a game is a great deal, and even if you break them down to their individual costs, you're still saving $3, so it's *really* hard to see this as some kind of rip-off."
59294,"&gt; That is irrelevant.

It's really not. You're arguing the game itself should be standard priced at $50 and thus the $60 version is an above-average price. It's not. $60 is the standard price of a video game. Yes, most HD remakes are a little cheaper. No, they don't have to be.

&gt;if you really think that is dumb, then you wouldn't be defending their decision to do this.

I'm not defending their decision to do this. I flat-out said it was stupid. However, you made an analogy that one would have to spend $13 extra to enjoy the game with a minor bonus to it. That isn't true. You could (and did) make the argument that you have to spend $10 extra to enjoy said minor bonus, but again, that's only if you take $50 as standard price for granted, which it isn't. Common, yes. Absolute, no.

You're making it out to be a scenario of ""pay extra to get the full game"" when it's really ""pay full price to get the game, an Amiibo, and an extra dungeon or pay less to get the regular game.""

&gt;the amiibo gating has been getting worse and worse, 

Actually, I'd have to disagree. This would be the most substantial content locked behind Amiibo for sure, but in most games they don't really do much of anything.

Not to mention we don't even have full details on this. It's one website that has since been pulled. It might be a little too soon to get up in arms about this.

&gt;wait until entire sections of games or entire characters are locked behind amiibo.

Well, ignoring this being a slippery slope fallacy, I don't really see Amiibo as being all that different from standard DLC. It kind of rings of ""it's okay to charge $20 for some maps in Call of Duty, unless it's in the form of a $13 figurine."" The only problems I have are in the limited quantities (which even now aren't as big of a deal as they used to be) and the future-proofing, but there's a simple solution to that (release it like regular DLC in the future)."
62601,"That's the price of the game if you don't want the Amiibo and extra dungeon. If you do, it's $60, the same price as basically every other video game. $60 for a video game is not extra. It costs more than another version, sure, but it doesn't cost more than standard video game price.

That would be like looking at a game where the retail disc is $50 and the digital download is $40 and saying ""I can't believe they want us to pay $10 extra just to get a stupid plastic disc!""

That's not how it works. One version is regular priced, the other is cheaper than regular price and comes with slightly less content.

&gt;I don't think any of those other day one DLC shits are ""okay"" at all.

Day one DLC is absolutely okay. When you finish making a game, it has to go through QA, certification, printing, and shipping. That usually takes weeks to months. In that time, the devs are usually working on bonus content. They're not going to just sit on finished content and not release it because ""day one DLC isn't okay.""

That said, I'm assuming you meant ""on-disc"" DLC and not day-one DLC, in which case I agree, it's lame as hell. I like Amiibo because I like the figurines themselves, but as a DLC model, I'm not sure I like it. It's a little different from Infinity and Skylanders in that it's not content locking for just one game, but for multiple. On the other side of the coin, you have people upset that they're paying $13 for DLC that doesn't really unlock much. I think Nintendo has to tread a fine line between releasing too much and not enough content behind DLC. Personally, I think the solution is to give the option of having any Amiibo content also available separately from Amiibo, especially when it's on-disc stuff."
63425,"&gt;50 is the price for the game.
60 is the price for the bundle including an amiibo (normally priced 13) and the game (normally priced 50)

Then I guess we disagree on which is the ""normal"" version of the game. Considering they don't even sell the Amiibo-less version in their biggest market, I'm arguing the $60 Amiibo bundle is the ""normal"" version and you have the option to pay less to get it without one, not the other way around.

&gt;Very little (paid) day one DLC is actually made in between the game going gold and it releasing, that's a fucking fairytale and you damn well know it.

That's a pretty big accusation to posit, I'd be interested in seeing if you have any sources on the majority of day-one DLC being 100% confirmed to be finished at the same time as the base game while the developers apparently sit around doing nothing for months yet somehow still have jobs and can pay their bills.

&gt;(what we currently know of )the situation with this amiibo support in TP:HD.

What we currently know is actually nothing. Amazon France posted a sentence they later deleted. Literally nothing has been officially confirmed."
65940,"&gt;Every market except NA put together is bigger then NA.
so the majority have the game for 50, with the bundle for 60

Except every area also has the bundle available...

&gt;I heard from someone in NA that the bundle is called a limited edition,

It isn't. It's officially called ""Twilight Princess HD with amiibo"".

&gt;most of the time spend inbetween end of development and release is spend on bug fixing and the like.

Again, source please. Because as far as I'm aware, most developers have entirely separate teams devoted to bug fixing and DLC development.

&gt;You know well enough what I meant mate, no need to hassle for using the wrong terms.

Not trying to hassle you, just pointing out it's a little early to be upset about how this is going to affect all future Nintendo games; we don't even actually know how it affects this one."
130816,"Close enough I guess. I stand corrected.

There aren't really costumes in Mario Maker and Mario Kart is more like kart skins, but again, close enough. I'd still argue unlocking a dungeon is a little more specific than these, and I'm not convinced it'll do the same thing in Zelda U considering there's really nothing to suggest it will, but when you're wrong, you're wrong, so my bad."
