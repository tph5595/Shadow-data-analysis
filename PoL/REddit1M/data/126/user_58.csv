86424,"&gt;Not easy, I grant. It would have delayed the release even more, to write, create, code rich, deep side quests. But I would have waited for that.

That is just not how it works. You can't throw more money or more manpower at something. There are diminishing returns in software development. We got the best or close to the best version of this game we could possibly get. Now that they have the engine down and a little more experience working in the open world genre maybe the next game will go even further, but I'm not sure. 

I think a lot of people just expect way too fucking much from video games and there is not infinite room for improvement. You want a rich 50 hour story, choices that impact everything that happens in the world dynamically, a killer physics/chemistry engine, engaging combat, great graphics, no glitches. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if nothing like this was ever released because it's just too much work to be feasible. Not in our lifetimes anyway."
