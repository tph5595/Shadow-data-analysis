7047,"Well, it's kind of a zero-sum game given today's tech, budget and time constraints. If we had a BotW map with MM's sidequests, OoT's story, TP's dungeons and the best music from the series, this would undoubtedly be the best Zelda ever made and likely impossible to top. But that just can't happen in a few years when players are starving for a new Zelda, or even with as large a budget as BotW has. There has to be a focus on certain things and less on others.

That being said, I think BotW was a huge risk for Zelda more than anything else - decades of conventions were trashed and an open world of this size with as many tiny details was unprecedented. Having seen the game's success and critical reception (well, fan reception since critical reception was nigh flawless), I'm very confident the dev team will deliver on many hopes that were built on this game but weren't quite accomplished this time around. BotW proved this formula has insane promise. The next Zelda will flesh it out and deliver something we have been subconsciously begging for. ^(Am I *already* hyping up the next Zelda...?)

Also doesn't help that the Switch BotW trailer was probably the best videogame trailer many people have ever seen."
