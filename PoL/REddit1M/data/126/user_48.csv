But the internet tells me the average is way shorter. My mind is blown! But i do everything in those games... I'd 250+ hours down before fighting Ganon in BotW though"
71210,"I agree. The games still a 10/10 for me, and it's my favourite game ever, but I'd have liked more stuff that felt rewarding. I spent 250 hours on my first playthrough, and i loved the first 210 hours, but that's just because the game world was full of quirks like fire swords keeping you warm that were there to discover. In some ways it was like exploring the perfect game engine, but I'd have much preferred having to earn things like the clothing. Few people liked Skyward Sword (i personally loved it even when replaying last year) and one thing i hope they bring back was the gratitude crystals. They really made theâ€‹ side quests feel worth while."
