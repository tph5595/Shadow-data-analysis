*BotW is the perfect (and perhaps the first?) casual-epic game.*

At this point in my life, between job, kids, etc. I don't have time to play 200 hour games with absurdly deep ability and progression systems.  If a game has an online guide longer than 30 pages devoted to the crafting system, I'm out.  20 minute cutscenes used to enrich my gaming experiences... but now feel like an irritation that takes away from my playtime.  I typically only have 20-30 minutes to play in a day.  BotW accommodates this.  My play sessions usually consist of identifying 1-2 things I'd like to do (solve a shrine, take down an enemy encampment, climb a tower, complete part of a Divine Beast, etc.).  Without too much stress or difficulty, I always leave having done exactly this and I always leave smiling.  Quite honestly, many of the puzzles aren't any more challenging than something I would do in ""Pushmo"" or ""Box Boy.""  BUT... Pushmo and Box Boy ARE NOT ZELDA.  This game makes me feel the same way about Zelda games that I used to as a kid... without demanding the heavy investment I used to make in Zelda games.

I would add that the game is approachable enough that my 10 year old LOVES playing it (and she's logged more hours than me!).  My three year old has even gotten into the act (though she just climbs trees and takes photos, lol).  I can't imagine either of my girls having as much fun with a previous Zelda title.

I completely understand that people here frequently wish the game had been more demanding with a deeper system of character progression and more developed story.  I can only say that as an old fart who still loves Zelda, I really can't imagine a more perfect game than this one for me."
