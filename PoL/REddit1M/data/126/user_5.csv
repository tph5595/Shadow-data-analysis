4096,"I can't agree more with your post. I love love love this game. I spent $350 to play it, and I would do that again. I could have beaten the game already, but have so many shrines/areas/side quests left that I don't feel I should. Been working on collecting unique gear and doing shrine/side quests while still having two Beasts to go.

I love the puzzles, how much of a mind fuck moving divine beasts around is, and the physics/elemental aspects to everything. That stuff is so cutting edge and new to me. My issue with the game is that the cities have no character to them. Everyone is just standing around in the same places, and get some changed dialogue once you defeat the local divine beast. Compare this to witcher where there's kids running around, local people having problems of their own, towns burning down or changing in between your visits. It's just a much more dynamic and immersive setting.

Now Witcher doesn't have a lot of the cool puzzle aspects of Zelda. It's not a ""thinker's game"" like zelda. It's a story driven hack n slash, but the story and the world are just so amazing.

I'm so happy that I have gotten to play Witcher 3 and BOTW in the last 12 months. Definitely two of the most innovative games to come out recently and I'm excited to see the impact they both have on the RPG genre in the future.  "
100556,"Yes I love Tarrey town and that whole quest line of course, very fun and rewarding. I actually liked Kakariko(sp?) village a lot too. That had a lot to do, reasons to explore the village like the fairy/first pikango quest. The thing I really liked about Kakariko is when you get there and read the town journal, you find out what is going on. Archer lady is horny, Chicken man lost his chickens, etc. If you figure out all of those side quests then you get the ball behind Impa's throne and can complete the shrine. I loved that, it gave me purpose to explore the town. Meanwhile, the entire Goron volcano feels less interactive than the OOT version. I feel like there's more going on in the southern mining post than the city themselves. "
