37399,"Shigeru Miyamoto said himself that he wasn't focused on the story or narrative for botw, nor was he focused on story or narrative for really any Zelda. Ever since alttp Shigeru Miyamoto had very little to do with the story all he cared about was the players experience from a gameplay perspective. He even had a full version of alttp developed and ready to go that played like an RPG. However, we got the third Zelda installment of alttp that we know and love that was the most story driven Zelda of its time. Miyamoto always had a separate division for narrative in Zelda games and then he primarily directed the gameplay. Botw was so much Miyamoto's project, it was his desire to create his first idea of the original LoZ in a 3D landscape that was truly non-linear and open world. It was his final attempt to recreate the idea of Zelda that comes from his childhood and exploring basically everything he could encounter as a child. However, according to him this was indeed his last attempt due to him not wanting to work on Zelda games anymore in the future. So perhaps we have to take botw as what it truly was meant to be and that was just a re imagination of the original LoZ which clearly had little story or narrative. However, the engine and foundation of botw is there for the future, perhaps we can hope to see the next Zelda installment with a huge emphasis on story and narrative since they already have this near perfect gameplay that botw brings and all they have to do is fine tune it and then they can spend years on story development and awesome side quests that don't involve rushshrooms. Although it is sad to me that Shigeru Miyamoto is done with Zelda I can only hope for the best in the future and think what we will get next will be incredible. Maybe the lack of narrative in botw was Nintendo paying there sort of respect to Miyamoto and letting him focus entirely on the over world and gameplay knowing that his genius was leaving Zelda development forever and they could very easily revamp the story arc with amazing writing in the near future. Just my thoughts on what might and or is happening, coming from a massively huge Zelda fan."
