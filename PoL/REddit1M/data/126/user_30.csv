27702,"&gt; The lack of narrative/progression/stakes was honestly my biggest problem. There was just zero sense of urgency the entire game.

Because it's non-linear? Seriously if they fixed it the way you wanted people would be complaining that it's to straight forward and rigid."
29489,"&gt; Just because you can do the parts of the game in any order doesn't mean those individual parts couldn't have had greater narrative progression

In order to have a cohesive, driven narrative the pieces of that narrative pretty much have to happen in pretty much the same order without writing several different complete scripts (at which point the budget starts limiting gameplay options).

&gt; Maybe the events of one part of the game change based on what you've done previously

They already do, and if they did it more they'd be writing several scripts like I said above

&gt; there are more story bits scattered across the world to fill in the gaps in momentum between ""go to this corner of the world, talk to elder, meet helper, get into beast, find 4 terminals, fight blight"".

This would make the story considerably less cohesive. Sure, it would help fill in the background and help flesh out the world, but it wouldn't do anything to move the story along as a whole. And they're not going to write a novel for every side quest in the game. "
