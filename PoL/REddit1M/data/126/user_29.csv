If there isn't any story or unlockables, and you find yourself not wanting to play the game, then why would you want to keep playing just for the story? Botw made you play 100+ hours without any unlocks or that many side quests, isn't that a good thing? The world should be fun to explore on its own. The last 50 hours I spent in Skyrim was purely for the story, but looking back at it, I would've had more fun spending 50 hours in a new game, or simply reading a book.

Nintendo has always kept story in the backseat, one of the few companies carrying the Doom philosophy, and I love them for that."
27139,"that's not a question. it's rhetorical, implying two things: botw is empty, and an empty world cannot be beautiful. Both I disagree with.  Most people spend easily 100 hours on botw so it's definitely not empty, but even if it is, an empty world can be beautiful"

Nothing in a dungeon is ever explained as to why they exist or tied to the story, they exist because gameplay, period. Also Smash Bros, Pokemon, Splatoon, Metroid. Their philosophy is interesting gameplay first, and then let's write a story around that. Almost every other company thinks the other way."
41736,"Yeah. But that's expecting botw to be something it's not. It nailed the open world in a way that no one else has, and that alone took them 6-8 years. However it does suck for the hardcore fans who have played every zelda game and still want more of that."
55465,"Well yeah, because botw is not an open world RPG with caves in it. You have to get the world right first before you delve deeper into extra stuff. No open world game even did the basic of trees correctly before botw. One step at a time."
284227,"That's what I mean by expecting it to be something it's not. If you want dungeons there're plenty of games with dungeons. There're pretty much no open world games with interactive trees. (it's also not just trees, what about lightning, fire, electricity, ice. everything just works)"
