15525,"BotW definitely seems more like Nintendo testing out the new direction for the series, and it worked for the most part. This game, while not perfect, at least makes me look forward to the future of the series. It's a step in the right direction, and it was a pretty great step. 

I don't know if I can say it has topped my favorite Zelda game, but I can at least say for certain that it's the best one in recent years. "
