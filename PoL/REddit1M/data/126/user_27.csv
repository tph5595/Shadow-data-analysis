24190,"Couldn't agree more. Botw is one of the worst zelda games ive played for sure. It feels like Aonuma ran out of ideas and just started playing skyrim, which they did admit that they had borrowed a lot of ideas from skyrim...


Its still a good game, id put a 7/10 on it easily, its just the game is filled with little tree person poop and micro dungeons. Like wtf? If i had the chance to not buy the switch and zelda and get my money back I would for sure!"
