84583,"I agree with most of what you said. My big concern going forward is Zelda will start to become just another open world series in an already immensely saturated market. The puzzle solving was lackluster in this game, and the dungeons felt like an after thought. Of the 120 shrines, maybe a third even had puzzles? And of those, none made me think very hard like previous zelda games. 

To me, what made a zelda game great was the 50/50 time split between exploring and discovery, and the mind-bending, engaging dungeons and puzzles. To me, this game broke conventions, which in many ways was great, but in the process, I think it forgot who it was. I know that sounds cheesy, but its the best way I can describe it. I hope that the open world stays, but I want a better narrative next time, and I think instead of four very small dungeons and tiny shrines, the world should have some huge dungeons to explore, some on the level of Twilight Princess, Majora's Mask, really any other title. 

So, I just hope the series doesn't lose itself. And despite everything I listed, I think the game is ridiculously FUN. It plays amazing, and its polished a great deal. It plays like a Zelda game, but it was missing some key components.
