8183,"i agree with everything. 
i love this game, but i realised that its far from being a ultimate zelda game they wanted to create. anyways, i do believe that this game is the ultimate foundation for future zeldas. a world like this with more content/depth, bigger dungeons and more enemy variety.... i could go on and on, i even made my first ""review""-like post because of this game. theres so much to improve on and im really exited what the next zelda has to offer


your ""horse chase"" idea is great btw! something like this would have been perfectly fitting. it would have given the horses much more value too.
