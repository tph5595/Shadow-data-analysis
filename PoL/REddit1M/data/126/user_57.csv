84992,"I like this game in general, but idk how to feel about it being a Zelda game.

The combat and learning curve is fun in the sense that it's refreshing, but hardly anything remarkable. The games from ""From Software"" such as Bloodborne and Dark Souls do this a lot better, combat has a lot of tension and the combat mechanics are rock solid and being able to show your skill feels very rewarding in those games.

Exploration is fun to a certain point but it takes away the mystery and becomes a chore at a certain point. The map is just too big, the landscape does offer variety and so on, but in the end it feels like a ubisoft game where I just do checklist activities because I'm an OCD gamer in the sense that I can't let stuff unchecked. Everything the map ends up offering are chests, shrines, towers, Hinox/Talos and Koroks. Unlike ALTTP-SS I don't feel like there's enough drive to explore, just offering a lot of possibilities is not enough drive to explore and that is the main gripe I have with most sandbox games. Games like The Last of Us and Silent Hill have such a powerful world that I can't escape from it's reach, I simply have to know everything there is to know about the environment and story. 

Multiple approaches and so on in open worlds just end up with dicking around. I like dungeons that first allow you to progress when you unlock dungeon items (keys, master keys and weapons) and while ALBW gave an interesting change I think that ALBW ends up feeling a bit generic.

The story/cutscene/dungeon parts of the game are by far my favorite parts, that was when I felt the game was most engaging. At those moments I told myself that this is the game I want to play.

All in all I think it's an original albeit not polished approach, the biggest issue I have is the generic nature of an open world sandbox game and the lack of urgency. This game does not feel like a journey, but rather like a sandbox. In the end I start feeling like the vast map and ""checklist"" tasks end up feeling like a chore to explore, then I get burned out and once I complete the game once I don't feel like going back to it, at least not the full experience. Which is such a shame, because I have completed ALTTP, OOT, MM, SS, ALBW multiple times and I get excited about revisiting those games too.

I don't mind BOTW and I think it is great for Zelda fans that they can enjoy such a hit, I just hope the next games take a different approach."
