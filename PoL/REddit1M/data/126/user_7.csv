5692,"I agree on pretty much all points. The lack of narrative/progression/stakes was honestly my biggest problem. There was just zero sense of urgency the entire game. How could any sort of momentum in the story possibly be kept up when the only slim pieces of narratives are likely separated by hours of directionless wandering? It was clear that this world was largely in ruins but Ganon never posed any immediate danger to the people inhabiting that world. When I finally went to fight Ganon it didn't feel like the climax or culmination of a great journey, it was more like ""I guess I should probably get around to that sometime"". It just didn't feel like a complete story, but rather wandering around doing a bunch of things for 100 hours until I decided to beat the game."

Just because you can do the parts of the game in any order doesn't mean those individual parts couldn't have had greater narrative progression or upped stakes, nor should it mean the way those parts connect couldn't have formed a tighter story. Maybe the events of one part of the game change based on what you've done previously, or maybe there are more story bits scattered across the world to fill in the gaps in momentum between ""go to this corner of the world, talk to elder, meet helper, get into beast, find 4 terminals, fight blight"".
