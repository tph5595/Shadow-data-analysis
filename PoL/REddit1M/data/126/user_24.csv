21426,"My only complaints so far (3/4 dungeons complete):

- wish the dungeons were longer, more challenging, and more rewarding. It didn't give enough closure having the dungeons be so short. The shrines somewhat make up for it, but the dungeons could've been a lot better.

- music was lackluster. I know it was part of the ""wild"" theme but the background music felt very muted even when it did exist. I wish there was a setting to make it louder.

However, I will say that the side quests are pretty fun. I don't really do the boring stuff but I will do the stuff that looks fun or adventurous or leads to a cool item. "
