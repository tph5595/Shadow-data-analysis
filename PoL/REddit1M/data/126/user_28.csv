24587,"I see what you're saying but my problem is that even given that, the game isn't so well made. 75% or so of the puzzle shrines is just a rehash of the skills learned on the plateau. "
24898,"I spent 40 hours being wowed and going ""oh man, I've just scratched the surface of this game,"" and ""I can't wait for some of the better shrines."" But they never came. I had completed the eight or nine unique world events that truly blew my mind, and most lasted around 15 minutes max. "
25245,"That's a... strange question to which the answer is obviously yes. It's a beautiful, beautiful game regardless of its contents. "
25545,"They were the length of the first dungeon in most games. They are comparable to a mini dungeon like ice cave or beneath the well. 

"
27073,"That's fine, what they are called is far less important than their content. 

And semantics aside they were the least satisfying boss-holders/whatever you wanna call it of any 3D Zelda game. "
28017,Honestly the game was more fun before I realized there are no caves or massive dungeons to explore. It was kind of a false hope..
28527,Can you point me to a game that's as beautiful or in a similar style? I would love to play it.
31498,"I'd hardly consider wanting caves and/or dungeons in a fantasy action/adventure game to be a fixation.. They create more compelling experiences than an over world, in my opinion. Dungeons have always been my favorite part of the Zelda series. 

But I honestly just wanted some depth, any depth, to the game and I found there to be none."
32395,"Nope. But the point was those first 40 hours were fun primarily due to my anticipation of the late game. The 20-30 hours I spent in all the other games were amazing, and I felt satisfied at the end."
35409,Would you rather play a 10/10 game for 25-30 hours or an 8/10 for 40?
35487,"The lack of aesthetic variety really kills it for me, though I agree they are amazing in terms of puzzles. But honestly feeling like I am in a dungeon and exploring is around 50% of the fun of dungeons for me."
35929,"There is depth only if you limit yourself to certain items or certain runes. Otherwise, it's all very similar. "
36319,"At the very beginning, I agree. But you scale up so fast that any combat becomes moot with the plethora of shock arrows etc. The plateau was amazing but your character is too OP too quickly."
38164,How? I can kill a hinox before it wakes up and can pretty much stunlock a silver lynel to death.  By the time I got level 3 knights armor it was impossible to hurt me more or less. 
42328,Expecting an open world RPG to have a cave is asking it to be something it's not? I disagree. 
70132,Id prefer dungeons to interactive trees..
