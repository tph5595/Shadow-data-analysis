13274,"In some ways the Maliced Dragon made it worse, because it cast the rest of the game in a more negative light due to how cool the Naedra fight was. I was somewhat down on the game having a lot of weird flaws, and a bizzare sense of endless emptiness that somehow encouraged exploration; aka five minutes of wandering til I found a rare island of activity to interrupt the emptiness. A korok, a shrine, a few enemies, punctuating an otherwise empty and low density world where 90% of gameplay feels like you are just walking to the next 30 seconds of fun.

I encountered the Malice infested Naedra around 20 hours into the game, and it suddenly made me go ""wow!"" for the first time. I found myself thinking ""this is super cool and memorable, maybe this game is better than I thought. I guess this is one of those games where the cool stuff doesn't happen until you are pretty far into the game. Never a good game design choice, but at least now I am looking forward to more cool things finally!""

And then it never happened again. Over 100 hours later there was not one time where I came across something like that corrupted dragon again. The divine beasts were meh, Ganon was meh. The Yiga Base side quest which seemed cool at first, ended in a massive momentum killing joke boss that left me feeling very unfulfilled.

Most of the Shrines wound up being meh too. I encountered The Shrine of Power as the 15th or so shrine I encountered and I was all like, ""oh yay a shrine that lasted longer than 30 seconds. Maybe as the game progresses, the shrines will get better."" 120 shrines later, the number of interesting shrines in the game that lasted longer than a minute can be counted on one hand.

Ultimately, I imagine five years from now that there will be very little I remember specifically from this game other than Naedra and the Zora prince."
