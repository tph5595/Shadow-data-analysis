11622,"This speaks volumes about the general gaming public's recent preference for bloated, time-sucking open-world RPGs ala Bethesda. Part of it is that new games are so damn expensive that we want to get as many hours of gameplay possible from them. Part of it is that jumping from screen to screen has made us so ADD that we'd rather screw around in a giant sandbox than committ to a storyline. Majora's Mask is my favorite Zelda game because I was emotionally invested in it, even though it's the shortest console Zelda game.  Still stoked as hell to play BOTW (just got a second-hand Wii-U from a buddy this weekend!), but will try play it as linearly as possible and avoid frivolous shit like collecting items "
