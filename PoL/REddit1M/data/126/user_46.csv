59006,"I agree. I have high hopes for the DLC (maybe more than I should), especially the hard mode. Combat became way too easy after a while, and I'm hoping they tweak that in the higher difficulty other than giving the enemies more HP/harder hitting attacks.

The sidequests could absolutely be better. Having just completed The Witcher 3 I found them way too simple, though I didnt expect much to start with.

I really enjoyed my time with the game and can't wait to return when all the DLC is out!"
