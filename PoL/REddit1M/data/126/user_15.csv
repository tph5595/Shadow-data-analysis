9883,"I want to second the sentiment whole heartedly. 

As a kid, they couldn't make a game epic enough or long enough to satiate my time I could devote to these endeavors. 

Now? Married, kids, job... This Zelda game gives me those same feelings without the grinding or time investment. The balance between effort and reward is balanced extremely well with Breath of the Wild for the time im able to give. 

And like you, my kids are just as in awe as I ever would have been. 

Well said. "
