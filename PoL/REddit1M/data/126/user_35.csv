29833,"&gt;Yes the view was spectacular from up there, but it was spectacular anyway, what about gameplay?

Honestly, what the heck did people except from this game? When you get to the top of that mountain you can:

1) Get a better view of locations/items of interest 

2) be able to shield surf down it

3) Have a launching point for paragliding, which can give you an aerial combat advantage to nearby enemies 

All game play opportunities. Should there be a magic doodad on the top of every land formation?


&gt;How about: the character that makes armor that lets you sustain the cold has been kidnapped. You have to break him out of prison. Better yet, the army that took him the town for cold gear, so the people are freeing because their cold gear maker is gone. They're living on peppers, but running out of them (they'll pay you more for peppers, in fact--economics and all that). You can decide to help the town out and go rescue the man (Rito, whatever) who makes the cold gear.

To be honest you seem to have specific expectations for what Open world games should do. Also. i think you tend to compartmentalize the content of BoTW too much instead of looking at the bigger picture IMO.

30077,"Have you been playing Nintendo games for the past... forever? In the vast majority of their games the gameplay is the foreground in front of story. The exception to this is Fire Emblem, where the story is integral."
30207,Why the fixation on indoor/underground environments? Sprawling landscapes have more grandeur than room-to-room escapades IMO 
34168,"&gt;I honestly just wanted some depth, any depth, to the game and I found there to be none.

There being *no* depth seems wrong. The physics and mechanics alone offer a huge amount of variety compared to other open world games"
36060,Really? There are so many options in combat though
38030,I'm the late game with lots of arrows but it's still a lot of fun experimenting with different strategies. Of course at some point you'll become powerful but I still found my ass getting kicked occasionally even in the late game
38433,Well that's just cheesing in the late game.
