36206,"Every single 3D Zelda game ever has a balance of what is great and what is lackluster about it, and it will always be true as long as people have different tastes and resources are finite.

Ocarina of Time was basically the only one to sort of ""excuse"" itself from this because there was nothing else to compare it to at the time.

So you have OoT:  It was amazing at the time but is pretty basic by today's standards.

Majora's Mask:  Excellent character/story telling/quest system, but few dungeons, minimized overworld and the time mechanic turned many people off.

Wind Waker:  Great story, extremely free adventuring, but a world that consists mostly of water which is functionally empty space with few dungeons.

Twilight Princess:  (Mostly) great dungeons, extremely well-recieved art-style, solid execution of all the 'classic' Zelda mechanics, but inside an empty, segmented world with items that are more often than not completely useless outside of their dungeon.

Skyward Sword:  Great dungeons and extremely distinct gameplay design/direction, but no ""world"" and is missing many of the classic Zelda ""pieces"".

Breath of the Wild: Fantastic, fun all-around gameplay.  It's a joy just to move around and explore the world, using the various game mechanics.  The towns are fantastic, the world's design is phenomenal and everything that it tried to do it did fantastically.  However it lacks great dungeons, narrative and narrative-driven gameplay.  The music is has is absolutely fantastic, but it has too much silence.  

There is no 3D Zelda that somebody couldn't write up a list of complaints for.  The only time this was ever *sort of* possible was with OoT, but even then you had your fair share of people complaining that it wasn't as great as ALTTP.

There will *probably* never be a Zelda game that won't displease many, because what they excel at is focusing on a certain design direction that is going to please fans of that direction a *whooole* lot.  What really matters is how good of a job they do in that direction, and how well it can hold up everything else as a whole.  So long as Nintendo has limited time and money, they will never be able to produce a game that blows absolutely everybody away in every aspect, and it's doubly impossible because the inclusion of some things (like lots of dungeon gameplay) can be detrimental to many people (like people who don't like dungeons).  The opposite is also true, as many people aren't fans of open worlds.

In the end, what matters is the balance of what is good as what isn't that good.  BotW - like every other Zelda ever - absolutely excels at what it's good at, and for that is an absolutely fantastic game despite the fact that it might not excel at what other Zelda games have.  Likewise, those Zelda games are extremely lackluster in those areas compared to BotW.

The whole ""this is a fantastic game but here's what isn't"" thing is just getting old.  Every single game is going to have parts that aren't fantastic.  What makes it good is how many parts it has that *are*, and BotW has very, very many."

That's almost never the case in open world games, and it has never been the case in Zelda.  In every other 3D Zelda game the best you can find by 'exploring' (not just following the linear path) is usually rupees.  Even in the 2D games you'll rarely find anything  that doesn't effectively say ""you can't do this til the story says"".

But there are things to find; more-so than there has been before.  Some cool, unrelated things I've found:  Evantide Island, that lady's cabin and her shield surfing minigame, or nearby the guy's bowling mini-game, that pitch-black bog above Hyrule Castle, the Hyrule Shield in the mini-dungeon just below there, the *Master Sword* and all related Lost Woods gameplay, the ""Forgotten Temple"" and all of its immediate death, the whole *town* of Lurelin, the Mogdula miniboss that came out of nowhere, etc.

How about all the various Shrine quests?  You'll say ""oh but they're exactly the same"" but then that's true about Zelda's past caves as well and what isn't the same is reaching them.  How about Tarrey Town?

There's a ton of shit to find all over.  It sounds to me like it's more a problem that you didn't find exactly what you wanted, which seems to be minidungeons/story, and yes it is a shame that this Zelda doesn't have much in that department but it's not the first and it won't be the last.  Every 3D Zelda focuses on something different."
