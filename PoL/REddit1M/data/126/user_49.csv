I agree that the game could do with more content. More quests. More of everything - however, you need to be careful for what you wish for.

I firmly believe that this game is one of the absolute best games I have ever played. It does Open World RIGHT in my opinion. 

Most games that does open world (Skyrim, Witcher, GTA, Dragon Age Inquisition, Assassins Creed etc etc) all have a common ""problem"" - the quest content and the open world feels disjointed.

GTA is obviously the king of this type of gameplay - what you do in the open world have absolutely no bearing on the story. It's almost like two different games. 

Most others tend to try and mix the two, which in my opinion tend to be to the detriment of both the open world gameplay, and to the story. Dragon Age Inquisition is a prime example of this.

BotW went another way. You only have a very loose story and quest elements on top of an open world. The world itself is the story, and not just a backdrop to the story.

You could add more things to the world. There are always improvements to be made, but it would have to be done very carefully. It's a thing edge to walk between a truly Open World and a linear game on top of an open world backdrop. 

I'm not saying that these other games I mentioned above is bad. They are good at what they do. What makes BotW great however, is that they decided to do something different and break the mold. While this comes with it's own drawbacks, I believe that it's a big reason for BotW being an absolute masterpiece."

Now, you might shout ""Witcher 3!"" and i'll agree. It had both great narrative story, and good open world - but the two were hardly merged. It was more like two games in one. The massive amounts of good sidequests you did, the exploration and the main story felt like 3 separate things.

That's not nessesarily a bad thing - 3 games in 1! - but BotW did it differently. It's narrative jarring however. You need to do all these massively important things that the story demands from you - or you can go out in the woods and kill wolves for a few days. Whatever... The world will wait around for you anyway.

In BotW almost nothing is mandatory, but everything moves in the same direction. You have only one objective - become powerful enough that you can beat Gannon. You can do this in 10 minutes, or 100 hours, and it still works.

The more limited story is what allows BotW to have the open world and the story that is there more tightly integrated.

Don't get me wrong, there could have been more quests, more things to do, more of everything, but the tightly story driven parts that you see in other open world games (Witcher, Dragon Age: Inquisition, Horizon etc) would fundamentally change the type of game, and in my personal opinion for the worse."
