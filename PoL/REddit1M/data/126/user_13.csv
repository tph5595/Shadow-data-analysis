9766,"&gt;In the end, the game's environment--rightfully lauded as jaw droppingly incredible--isn't filled with enough things to do

I see his type of comment a lot and I don't understand what people want. 

If you say ""I loved it and spent 100+ hours exploring but the world felt empty"" I don't think that means there isn't enough to do, it just means the world is awesome and you want *more* stuff to do.

I don't think this is a hype problem, it's just a human reaction to botw's appeal. 

The initial draw when you step out of the sor is how much there is to do/explore; unless there's a never ending supply of new things to do, you're going to run out of stuff eventually.

&gt;The awe and expectations I felt early in the game were never quite reached. The first time I saw a dragon in the distance--it was a feeling. ""Holy shit."" I wondered what town is it ravaging? What story line is going to require me to fight that dragon, or ride that dragon, or do anything except shoot it with arrows so that I can pick up its scale... But that's all it ended up being.

You weren't awed when you found the maliced dragon?

&gt;How about: the character that makes armor that lets you sustain the cold has been kidnapped. You have to break him out of prison

Sure, we can sit here and come up with in depth side quest all we want, but it's a matter of sticking a whole bunch of extra crap in an already huge game, not just being more creative.

&gt;The similarity of environment/goal/mechanics/bosses was a real heartbreak. Again, the promise was left unfulfilled.

What promise? It sounds more like you had very specific expectations that just weren't met. 

I liked the divine beasts. I also like long traditional dungeons. 

Kind of like how I like oot, but I also ww, but I don't complain about not being able play ww in oot bc that would be silly. 

I agree with some critiques (lack of depth to the champion stories, lack of enemy variety) but a lot seem to be holding it against Nintendo that they made a huge game bc, ""if you made it 9/10, why didn't you go 10/10?!?"" leading to the same sort of jump off complaint: it was great for 100 hours and then there was nothing ...

That's bc you just spent 100 hours doing everything!"
13941,"&gt;But I spent 100 hours and honestly don't feel like I did much.

I felt like I did so much in the first 100 hours. It was more that after that I wanted *more new* but there just wasn't any.

To me that's like loving a 1000 page book but then criticizing it for not being longer since you want more of what you like. 

&gt;""The game does a great job of encouraging exploration but not a great job rewarding it."" 

Agreed

&gt;I don't quite know what this means... 

It mean it's easy to take the finished game and then say ""look at all these side quests I can come up with in 5 minutes, why didn't you do this/why are you so lazy Nintendo?""

But it's not that they don't know what a side quest is, it's probably that they were busy spending all that time building all the other stuff in the game you love but put to the side when discussing the things you don't like. 

&gt;It was great for 100 hours, but I can see many ways in which those 100 hours can be better. It's that the 100 hours weren't as rich in the end as I thought they'd be playing for the first 10 hours.

Again, that's just human experience; it's gonna be more exciting 10 hours in than it is 90 hours in, which leads to the last thing ... 

&gt;Because some of the things that would have brought it closer to a 10/10 are quite obvious.

Maybe ... after Nintendo made a 9/10 game. 

If botw *didn't* have a wildly different puzzle/over world/dungeon system, we wouldn't be saying ""here's the stuff they left out: 1) more things you have to find by line of sight, 2) more physics based puzzles ...""

So, imo, to point at botw and say ""where are the long dungeons? where are the mm style side quests?"" is the same thing.

It's critiquing the game, not for what the game is, *but for not being a different game* that you see in your head."
