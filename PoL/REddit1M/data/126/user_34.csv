29257,"I agree, but I think after 100 hours you're going to start to burn out of *any* game. Not just BoTW. It's an unrealistic expectation that the largest Zelda game to date should be *even bigger*, with *even more* to do. 

I think it's a testament to how great this game actually is that we've all casually reached ~100 hours before even thinking or realizing that we're running out of things to do. "
