32522,"I think people forget how much fun the game is while you're playing it. That, or I just enjoyed the structure of the game more than most people. The way the game constantly weaves the player through a mixture of gameplay, puzzles, and combat, with easily the coolest chemistry system I've ever seen in a game, is beyond reproach for me. The game doesn't have a lot of side quests and dungeons is because it doesn't *need* them. The emphasis of the game is the world itself, and Nintendo structured the content in the game around that brilliantly.

The reason the side quests are usually mundane stuff like ""collect 55 rushrooms"" is because they don't want you to go straight out and do it, they want you to do these things while you explore. That's also why the rewards are never mind blowing; the game desperately avoids telling you what to do, which only emphasizes more exploration. To me the reward of climbing to the top of a mountain, defeating an entire enemy camp, or finding a hidden korok in the forest was never the item I got, but just the experience of doing it. That's why I love the game, and why I'm still trying to figure out what to play next. It all feels boring now."
