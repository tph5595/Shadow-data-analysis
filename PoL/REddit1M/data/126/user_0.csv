0,"120 shrines, ~200 Korok seeds, 4 Divine Beasts, Ganon destroyed,

For the first quarter of the playing time, I was in awe of the game. The map is obviously enormous, the art is obviously beautiful, there are obviously many places to go. In many ways, the game is obviously outstanding. The learning curve is impressive. You start out weak and easily decimated and collect gear and get better at fighting and power up with shrines and such. I like that the enemies don't change, you do. It makes collecting and exploring matter inherently to the game. 

But.

The awe and expectations I felt early in the game were never quite reached. The first time I saw a dragon in the distance--it was a feeling. ""Holy shit."" I wondered what town is it ravaging? What story line is going to require me to fight that dragon, or ride that dragon, or do anything except shoot it with arrows so that I can pick up its scale... But that's all it ended up being. Climbing to the top of mountain tops to lift up a rock to get a Korok seed began to feel as deep a gameplay mechanic as Candy Crush. Yes the view was spectacular from up there, but it was spectacular *anyway*, what about gameplay?

In the end, the game's environment--rightfully lauded as jaw droppingly incredible--isn't filled with enough things to do, and doesn't have enough narrative within it. 

Is getting 55 rushrooms really a fun sidequest? Can you call it a sidequest? I can sell rushrooms to anyone (a great feature! This game has an economy--rupees are worth something, at last! I liked that), is the fact that I have to sell this one person more, for a bit more money really a sidequest? 

How about: the character that makes armor that lets you sustain the cold has been kidnapped. You have to break him out of prison. Better yet, the army that took him the town for cold gear, so the people are freeing because their cold gear maker is gone. They're living on peppers, but running out of them (they'll pay you more for peppers, in fact--economics and all that). You can decide to help the town out and go rescue the man (Rito, whatever) who makes the cold gear.

It's totally optional. You can continue to eat peppers and beat the game, OR you can help the town out, and get cold gear, and have the satisfaction of having done something. This does a few things. It gives a side quest with a meaningful reward. It adds narrative in a game that sorely lacks it. It shows the consequences and stakes of Ganon's presence--another thing sorely lacking. And who knows what sort of gameplay comes about in the side quest. Is it a Yiga like stealth mission? Does it become a horse chase, where you have to ride after the man on horseback across Hyrule? (That sounds pretty epic. How was there not a horse chase?!) I don't know, I spent two minutes coming up with this, but I think it's a pretty good idea. There should have been dozens of these. 

You might say, some of the shrines gave you armor, so they were like a sidequest. But I just... don't agree. There were some great shrine puzzles (though, frankly, a lot of disappointment there, too), but the aesthetic constancy of the shrines and the fact that they don't progress the story much keeps me from counting them as 'side quests.' Yes you don't have to do them all, but unless you're doing a low-heart run, shrines are obviously a required part of the main game. I don't mind the shrine mechanic--mostly--I just don't think they justify the lack of meaningful sidequests in the overworld. How have we not had sidequests on par with Majora's Mask in 20 years? 

Related, the dungeon gameplay was sorely lacking. The similarity of environment/goal/mechanics/bosses was a real heartbreak. Again, the promise was left unfulfilled. The series's most epic overworld should have had the series's best dungeons--not the worst. The Goron Mines in Twilight Princess, the temples in Ocarina, even Skyward Sword had some incredible dungeons--they felt big and grand and epic. The Divine Beasts were fun--as subdungeons. 

And while it was a neat idea to let us go anywhere pretty much immediately, I do think it would have been fun to have some progression, to get some new items or unlock some new ability that might open up new areas--or, at least, give us something new to do or try.

I'm rambling, so I'll sum up the rest:
-Severe lack of narrative/stakes/danger. The desire for non-linearity has some serious drawbacks here. There can still be a linear narrative in a very open world. 
-Holy hell that final fight with Ganon. Especially the 'shoot the circles of light from the horse' bit. That seemed incomplete.
-If we're not going to do proper dungeons, a few more places like Hyrule Castle would have added some needed variety to the overworld.
-the bad shrines--oof.
-cooking could have had a little more depth. Combining of ingredients could have mattered more in interesting ways. (this is a very minor qualm).

I say this not to say I don't like the game. I adore it. But it's a very fine line, and I worry that with all the lavish praise it is getting Nintendo will ignore--and, because it's Nintendo, actually highlight--some pretty glaring flaws in the next game. They threw out a lot of what needed to go in the old games (but not everything; I'm looking at you fetch quests)--but also some of what made them great. I think they ought to bring some of that back.

I have hopes for some great DLC. 

edit: One big reason I want to point out the lacking side-quests is because it has plagued the series for a while now. This game, great as it is, should have been the one to fix it. I've no doubt Nintendo will read this post and make my suggested changes. "
2666,"Me too. The foundation is so, so strong, and that's why I do love the game. But I think they could produce something really out of this world. They knocked this one out of the park--but they could have knocked it out of the stratosphere with some, I think, relatively obvious fixes. "
4448,"Which do you like more, these or the old fashioned, big temple dungeon?"
6244,"It's been a hundred hours and I still have moments where the lighting and aesthetics make me say ""this is beautiful."" "
9013,"Yes it would have undoubtedly delayed the game. I would have been okay with that. But for now, I'm hoping they use the *exact same assets* to make a better game, as they did for MM (not that MM is better, but, you know what I mean). The 'one zelda per console' rule, though, might prevent this. 

I just worry the reviews that make it seem flawless will blind Nintendo to the flaws. "
9091,There are a thousand things they could have done within the world! They did very few of them. 
11281,"&gt;If you say ""I loved it and spent 100+ hours exploring but the world felt empty"" I don't think that means there isn't enough to do, it just means the world is awesome and you want more stuff to do.

But I spent 100 hours and honestly don't feel like I did much. That's my point. I wish there had been more to do. I got tired of moving a rock to get a Korok seed. Or talking to everyone in a town in the hopes of finding a fun side quest only to find one that was ""can you take a picture of this thing?"" or ""I need 10 luminous stones."" The best quote I've heard about this was ""The game does a great job of encouraging exploration but not a great job rewarding it."" I spent 100 hours exploring a *lot*. I enjoyed it! But I would have enjoyed it a lot more if the rewards had been more substantial. 

&gt; You weren't awed when you found the maliced dragon?

I will grant you this was a big step in the right direction! 

&gt;Sure, we can sit here and come up with in depth side quest all we want, but it's a matter of sticking a whole bunch of extra crap in an already huge game, not just being more creative.

I don't quite know what this means... 

&gt;What promise? It sounds more like you had very specific expectations that just weren't met.

The promise of a big, deep, rich world and a grand epic adventure. It gets the 'big' part down. The grand, epic adventure was a little lacking within that big world. I don't think the choice was binary: ""We can have an epic story line *or* we can have a big, beautiful world."" 

&gt; it was great for 100 hours and then there was nothing ...

Not what I'm saying. It was great for 100 hours, but I can see many ways in which those 100 hours can be better. It's that the 100 hours weren't as rich in the end as I thought they'd be playing for the first 10 hours. How much is a huge map worth? It's not worth, *nothing*, no doubt. It's a big, beautiful world. But that's obviously not all it takes to make a great game. 

&gt;a lot seem to be holding it against Nintendo that they made a huge game bc, ""if you made it 9/10, why didn't you go 10/10?!?""

Because some of the things that would have brought it closer to a 10/10 are quite obvious. Not easy, I grant. It would have delayed the release even more, to write, create, code rich, deep side quests. But I would have waited for that. "
17068,...um. Yes?
17157,Well... you'll have to collect items. It's pretty integral. Not for fetch quests but for survival.
17238,It's a fair point. They did a great job allowing short sessions of play. But I think my point is they could have *both*.
17393,"I admittedly play very few games, but the lighting mechanic alone seemed incredibly richer than any I've seen. How vastly different the colors at sunset were. How the grass glows. "
36388,"I spent it going places in the hopes of finding more and never finding it. I spent it scouring the southeast, because if there's no main level there, there's probably a mini-dungeon of some sort, right? Nope. The amount time it took to explore the game has no bearing on whether or not I feel all the exploration fulfilling. It--only slightly, but certainly--wasn't totally. "
42500,"It is fair--I do have a sense of 'who the fuck am I to critique, it's a great game that took 6 years to make.' "
83551,People keep mentioning this game. I play games pretty much Never these days. Do I need to play the first two?
