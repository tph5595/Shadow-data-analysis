3699,"I wouldn't say that this game has the worst dungeons. They're different, but they're supposed to be. They're not supposed to be sprawling mazes like most older dungeons. My real gripe with the dungeons was the bosses. Aside from Thunderblight Ganon, they all just felt the same. You didn't even have to do them in the way they wanted you to. You could just run up and slash at them."
13476,It shouldn't be that specific. I've played Zelda games where the big temple dungeons sucked and others where they were great. Breath of the Wild's dungeons are different and should be in their own category.
13997,"Why, because they're short? Because they don't have many rooms? Neither do many of the dungeons in the franchise. To say that the Divine Beasts are straight up not dungeons is silly and you're letting your hate cloud your judgement."
26814,"Except no first dungeon or mini dungeon was as complex with puzzles and layout as any of the Divine Beasts. Most the longest and most labyrinthian dungeons in the franchises weren't even this puzzle filled. The Divine Beasts may have been short, but the extent that the puzzles played in them was far greater than any older dungeon I can think of.

Again, I think the Divine Beasts should really be in their own category."

In some ways, I agree. In others, I think they were pretty amazing.
