6083,"They made a Zelda game in an entirely different way than ever before. They got the basics of this new style down, really well. But it is still a first try, with so much missing. They removed SO many elements from the previous Zelda games, and replaced them with not enough new elements. What they did introduce was great, but not enough quantity-wise. For a world as shallow as BotW, they should have condensed it to like 2/3 the size.

The only full-on screw-up is the pathetic dungeons and easy bosses"
