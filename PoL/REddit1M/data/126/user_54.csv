80510,"OMG Also, you can leave it for a month and come back to it and still know how to play!

I love the big games (Witcher) but when the military sends me away for periods of time, I come back and I don't even want to touch (Witcher) cause I put 100 hours in and need to finish the main quest, but im so far in the story that I need to be good at the combat and things you learn during the course of the game...but I've forgotten it.

In BoTW the controls are simple and clear and it's up to you if you just fight wacking things w sword or ZTarget and dodge parry etc"
80645,"Also, and this is part of what I love about BoTW's world... walk thru the wilderness IRL, it isn't jammed packed with 'things to do' And sections of Hyrule are the same- they're meant to just be explored and give you a scope of the beauty and size of the world"
81078,"Yeah I kinda agree about the towns. Minus Tarry Town of course. At least most of the towns have a purpose to them other than being a regional hub, I can't figure out the reason for that southern jungle port town. Everyone talks about the goron city or gerudo town etc but this place kinda seems tossed in

I find the various stables to be better hubs actually- every one I find seems to be a bustling place, people travelling through or running inside when it rains"
81226,OMG Where Witcher 3 side quests were better than many full game's main quests
81418,"I get this feeling too. When Nintendo tries new things it almost always changes everything (OOT, Mario64, Wii, Pok√©mon) but when they try to play safe things end up lacklustre (Wii U)

I am very happy they not only tried something new, they basically smashed the open world genre out to space (they COULD have done Zelda in the copycat 'safe' style of GTA/SaintsRow/Farcry/JustCause/ etcetcetc)"
81611,"I think the problem is they were focusing on making cool games back in the NES days, and never thought this would be a 30+ year series that would demand an overarching lore of dozens of games... 

And by the time they realised they had to come up with a damn lore it was too late so they pieced together the various timelines and that link/Zelda are (reincarnations? names for recurring heroes?)

Maybe it is time to reboot the timeline"
