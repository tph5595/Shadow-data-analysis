71878,"The thing is that many people, me included, expected there to be stuff. 

I mean, there are 4 divine beasts and... how many regions? Like 14? So I expected some bigger optional stuff. 

And there seemed to be hints of that. The Akala Tower could have made for an amazing sidequest, so could have the labyrinths. 

I mean the maliced dragon was Imo. the only real amazing thing that happened due to a sidequest as far as I can tell. 

Also there was some stuff, where you were like ""oh, that's cool!"" and then it turns out it is not unique. Examples are the mini bosses and the fairies. 

So you explore, with the expectation to find real cool stuff even after days of exploring like in Witcher, Skyrim, Dark Souls, MM, but it turns out that there is not much. "
