I say that because the structure of this game was extremely ambitious for them, and a huge departure from Skyward Sword, yet they did an amazing job.  It's so close to perfect that the areas for improvement stand out.  Given what they set out to do, and what they accomplished, I couldn't have expected anything more.

That being said, let's hope for some serious DLC.  Take my money, Nintendo!"
