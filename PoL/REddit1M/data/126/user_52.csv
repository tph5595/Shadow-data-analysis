75789,"&gt; The awe and expectations I felt early in the game were never quite reached. The first time I saw a dragon in the distance--it was a feeling. ""Holy shit."" I wondered what town is it ravaging? What story line is going to require me to fight that dragon, or ride that dragon, or do anything except shoot it with arrows so that I can pick up its scale... But that's all it ended up being.
&gt; 

I didn't like this part either.  Why would you make assumptions of something that was never promised or implied?  The dragons blew me away because they were so unexpected, you're just out doing whatever you're doing and suddenly you see a giant flying dragon.  ""What if's"" and ""could have""'s have no place in video game expectations."
