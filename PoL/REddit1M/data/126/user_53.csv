77197,"The transition from OoT to MM gives me high expectations for the next Zelda. OoT estabished the engine and basic mechanics, and I'm sure a lot of development effort went into that. With MM (my favorite 3D Zelda until BotW came along) the work on the engine and mechanics was done and the development effort was put into story and making a world that felt really alive. I expect/hope for that in the next iteration using the BotW system."
