39394,"From what I gather, they haven't.  I haven't found any link to it on any thread here, and I'm 95% certain that if it went up, a link would exist on this sub."
39866,"Yes, I see no reason why only Amazon and GameStop would get copies."

52934,"Reggie emphasized on Treehouse today that it was extremely limited.  As are most super special editions.  Defeats the purpose if they just make it a default edition.  Makes a few more people happy I guess, but in the end, it's nothing in there that you'll likely still have displayed or lying around in 10 years unless you're a serious collector."
54592,"Well I mean, I doubt Reggie knows or cares what retailers do.  It's surely not his say when they decide to set up pre-sales.  So we can demonize him for a poor warning but I mean, whatever, that's not really fair.

As far as manufactured scarceness goes,  I don't really buy that, I've never missed a rare Nintendo drop that I really wanted.  I put in the leg work, which sucks more often than not, but at the end of the day I get what I wanted.  The only difference between Nintendo and any other Publisher that's putting out a 100+ dollar limited edition is that Zelda for sure has legions more fans who will want it.  Ain't no one frothing at the mouth for the cool UC4 ultimate edition, and I suspect they did not print scores more of that then what Ninendo is doing for the Master edition."
