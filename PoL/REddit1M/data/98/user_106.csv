50863,I'm kind of taken aback that this is so hard to get ahold of because I've never had this kind of trouble getting a special edition Nintendo product before. Maybe Nintendo will increase their production run of this thing?
51891,"Yeah, I also settled for the Special Edition. Better than nothing at all, but it's still disappointing. Like I said, I've never had this hard of a time getting ahold of a special edition Nintendo product before. Generally as long as I didn't lollygag about securing a pre-order it's been fine, not something where it sold out in 10 minutes while I was sleeping."

It depends on how you define the purpose. I don't personally think that the purpose should be to create artificial scarcity so that it is hopefully more valuable for collectors down the road, better to let everyone who wants one have a reasonable shot at it. This stuff should exist to be enjoyed, not to be speculated on."
