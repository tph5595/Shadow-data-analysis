Granted the special edition is basically fine. The statue is nice but I can live without it. Now my problem is getting a switch itself."

virtual internet hugs and thank you kindly sir. I had not even thought to try target.

Amazon is back up for switch console pre orders in case anyone is reading this. I do not know how long but they are cheaper than alternatives if you have prime at least. I'm just refreshing the page for the master edition to see if i can get it on a second wave.

EDIT: target charges you up front for a pre order unlike... every other online retailer. great... now my bank account is drained and I have a bill payment pending on the account that no longer has enough money to cover it. It's so ridiculous all you can do is laugh I guess."
