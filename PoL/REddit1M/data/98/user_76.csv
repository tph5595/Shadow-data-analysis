From the treehouse live."

52532,"It's been pretty bad. The Majora's Mask limited editions (both game and console) were incredibly difficult to obtain, same with the Fire Emblem Fates special edition (which was the only way to get the complete game on one cartridge). Same with the Smash amiibos when they were first released. They make very little, and then they sell out almost instantaneously.

For the Master Edition, you had to either be up at 4:30EST/1:30PST for the Gamestop/Amazon pre-orders, or manage to snag one of the Best Buy pre-orders this morning, and all were sold out in minutes. 

And this is after it was just announced in a press release last night.

It's pretty absurd. Make enough to meet demand, Nintendo."
53730,"Reggie unveiled it and emphasized it was extremely limited--after it was already sold out at two of the three retailers you could purchase it from--and after they had quietly announced it in a press release at 1AM the night before; before going on sale at 4AM.

That's some warning, thanks Reggie.

No one's saying they want it to be a ""default"" edition, but they do want Nintendo to instate practices that give most of us a reasonable shot at obtaining it, and to produce a reasonable amount to begin with."
60826,"He should know and care, because this happens all the time. Poor inventory and poor pre-sale timing. They could easily tell or arrange with the retailers when to make it available, and they choose not to.

If you've never missed a rare Nintendo drop, then you've been extremely fortunate. I too, have been lucky--I was able to nab the Collector's Edition of Majora's Mask, both the 3DS and game, as well as the Fire Emblem Fates special edition--but all of them dropped with very little forewarning at odd hours and were gone within minutes. Unless you're someone that works and lives on a computer, you're shit out of luck. 

Lastly, there's no way to know the stock of Nintendo collector's editions versus the various collector's editions of games from other companies. It's entirely speculative. But what is clear is that Nintendo is doing entirely too little to meet demand on these popular releases. The scarcity is either manufactured or ineptitude."
