14547,I could only find the Special Edition at game which I pre-ordered for Â£89.99 plus the neon switch. That version doesn't come with the sword which sucks but honestly I want the map and case most anyway.

15133,I believe it matches up to [this](http://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-special-edition-switch) version so yeah it should. At least I've pre-ordered it under that assumption too :P
19424,I can't see any difference between them though? The one I ordered is the same bundle that Nintendo is showing on their site named Special editon [here](http://www.game.co.uk/en/the-legend-of-zelda-vreath-of-the-wild-special-edition-1791284). 
19636,hmm interesting that the side of the box does show the statue. Got me wondering now.
