13283,"That's the European [limited edition](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2CGy19UkAA4WoG.jpg), the Master and Special editions are US-only. Europe is getting shafted again... "
13313,"Sadly, we won't :("
13334,"Just the Limited Edition which only comes with the Master Sword, Sound Selection cd and game."
19321,"That's the European Limited Edition, Europe doesn't get the American Special and Master Editions... GAME (and other European retailers) misnamed it."
26319,"The differences are the coin, the map, carry case and Master Sword of Resurrection statue. [This](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/C2CeY0BW8AAGBbu.jpg) is the NA-exclusive Special Edition, [this](http://nintendoeverything.com/wp-content/uploads/breath-of-the-wild-limited-edition.png) is the EU/UK-exclusive Limited Edition."
33416,Yep... Wish Nintendo would stop doing that.
46018,Except the only difference was the chest. For Breath of the Wild we're getting less than half of the Master Edition. Not to mention the fact that the US got Collector's Editions since the N64 days while we got nothing and had to wait longer for games to come out. Europe has only started to get a better treatment since Skyward Sword.
95050,"The Adventure Sets were even in Europe hard/near impossible to come by and I never understood why people obsess over them so much. It's just a box with a t-shirt, soundtrack and pins that you can get everywhere else, it's only considered a ""holy grail"" because it comes in a special box that happened to be limited. It's nice to have but imo not worth shelling out $4000 for. 

At least the US had Nintendo Power, E3, Nintendo World Store etc. etc. When I was in the US 10 years ago I was stunned at how much Zelda merch was available there as nothing could be found here in Europe (maybe in France, Germany or the UK but definitely not the Netherlands or Belgium). Up until everyone and their uncle acquired the Zelda license and started making every kind merch you could ever think of. "
