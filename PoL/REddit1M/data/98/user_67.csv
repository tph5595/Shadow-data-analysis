30562,Well bollocks. Woke up just too late to get it from Gamestop it seems and of course Amazon's long gone. Time to play the game with Best Buy at least...

34397,Nice. Unfortunately I want the statue heh.
34962,That is a very good question. Can't even find dimensions for the box which would be a good way to roughly tell the statue's size. Wonder if we can assume everything in the picture is to scale..

Pretty much what I expected. Decided I don't think I'll miss having it, but would still be nice. So staying tuned for Best Buy still.."
