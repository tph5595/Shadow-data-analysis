5848,https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01MT8SWKC/ref=sr_1_5?s=videogames&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1484290574&amp;sr=1-5&amp;keywords=The+Legend+of+Zelda+Breath+of+the+Wild+Nintendo+Switch You are in luck :) ! Its only listed as the wii u version on amazon right now
6139,the special edition has everything besides the sword for 100 dollars. I'm so torn as to which one to get. I swear if that sword ends up being some tiny plastic thing and I get the master edition I'll kill myself.
11534,says its unavailable now
12256,"shit. I'm able to pre order the special edition... Should I just assume the master edition is sold out and get the special edition? I had the master edition in my cart, but accidentally closed chrome, and now its not working :("
13152,I know but now I don't get my amazon prime discount... Do you think it will be back up on amazon?
13974,"Yea I got it off of Gamestop I'm so pissed lmao. With my amazon prime discount the master edition would have been 104 dollars with free shipping, but ofc I clicked out of the cart, so instead I paid 142 dollars on gamestop :D"
14344,Hey its still up on gamestop man.
14468,"Also, It hasn't even gone up on best buy yet, and I might try to rebuy it on best buy and cancel my gamestop order if I get the chance because best buy has free shipping lol"
15115,"Yea I just hope the site isn't glitching, and I don't get some email the morning saying sorry but this item is actually sold out. That would be a heartbreaker, but I would have assumed it would be sold out on gamestop long ago"
