Amazon tends to have inaccurate listings for these late night launches, they'll fix everything along with the correct release date at some point."

The only reason I'm considering it is the timing is perfect with tax return money and not having to deal with Ninty's infamous stocking ability when Splatoon 2 comes out, which would be my preferred time to pick it up. "
