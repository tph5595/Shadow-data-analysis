50063,"Just tried pre-ordering it from my local Best Buy. It was in-stock when I was in line, but the associates couldn't figure out how to set up a pre-order and they sold out in that time frame. I really wish Nintendo would anticipate the demand better and increase production."
50226,"No joke. They did the same with the Fire Emblem Fates Special Edition last year and people threw a fit. Every time it was restocked, it sold out in minutes. Nintendo is beyond oblivious."
51491,"I doubt they will. The exact same thing happened with the special edition of Fire Emblem Fates. MSRP was $79.99, but was selling on eBay for an average of $250–$300 (actual sold listings). I went ahead and settled for the Special Edition of Breath of the Wild before it sells out too.

Edit: Looks like the Master Edition is averaging around $250–$350 on eBay (sold listings)."
