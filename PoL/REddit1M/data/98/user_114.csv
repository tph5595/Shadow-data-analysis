57869,"I wish we would get some *definitive* answer (e.g., not an Amazon listing) as to whether or not the Wii U version will have some sort of Master Edition. It obviously wouldn't have the Switch carrying case, but maybe something similar? 


I do want one for the Wii U, but honestly, I won't be...*too* bummed if we don't get one. I'm just happy we get the game at all. "
