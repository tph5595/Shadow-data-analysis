66999,"I finished all main quests except killing Ganon, doing that today.

The location for the 8th memory... Dunno if I'm stupid but I spent a good 4 hours trying to find it. I immedialy ruled out the correct location because the landscape changed between the photo of the memory and present time but I didn't realize it was normal :x. Also didn't use the painter NPC for that one.

When I saw the 17th memory and [the Master Sword started to glow and make a sound](/spoiler) I just pressed home and walked away. Also isn't this scene a retcon of SS's ending ? At least that's how I interpreted it.

That said after all the memories I really warmed up to Zelda's character, while I was pretty indifferent to her at the beginning. The poor girl.

Now for Hyrule castle ! I stocked on guardian arrows and I'm going in one shotting every guardian on my way. I mean business this time, Ganon."
