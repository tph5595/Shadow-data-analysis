25790,I definitely think part of the problem with the voice acting (in addition to the voice direction) is the translation of the script. A lot of lines seem to be translated literally/word for word instead of semantically and it comes out very unnatural sounding for an English speaker. So it's got tobe difficult to voice act lines that are extremely wordy and poorly phrased.
