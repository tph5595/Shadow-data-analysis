I loved riding Sidon towards Ruta, and the mini fight around it was lovely, yet despite the actual inside of the beast being ingenious and loving the trunk mechanic, I missed that sense of exploring a themed ""dungeon"".

I think I understand why they chose to go with these instead when placed in context with the rest of the world, still getting used to it...

Other than that, I'm absolutely in love with this game!"
