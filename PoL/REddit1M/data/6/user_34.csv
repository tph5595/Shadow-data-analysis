6470,"Hm. I had 4 hearts when I fought Water Ganon. used a +3 defense elixir and blasted him with elemental arrows.

i hid behind the statue in the room in order to dodge his spear attack while shooting arrows. I had around 15-20 of each element, and didn't use half of them. Not sure what bow I had, the 26 damage knight bow I think."

7052,"I swapped up to 10 heart upgrades to get the Master Sword and haven't switched back yet.

Only have 3 stamina upgrades. Probably going to respec two more to get a full bar.

I really enjoy having a lot of hearts mostly so that when I cook really good meals it actually helps me, lol."
7692,"Knowing what weapon to use. There's enemies that will out range you enough that using a two-handed weapon is extremely difficult, and even shield+sword. 

Spears have lower damage but really quick attacks. A guardian spear++ has 20 damage, and Guardian Great Axe++ has 60 damage. 

In combination, pay attention to how fast the attacks of the enemies are. If they're super fast then a shield+sword would be most useful. If they're slow and you can move around them, two-handed weapon.

If you get the Champions Tunic you can see the health of enemies, I like to use this on guardians so that I can get a feel for how long a fight is going to take before I engage. "
7799,I am still unable to find the royal stallion. :(
8206,"Happy to help! 

I mention the tunic because some of those tests of strength, the guardians have 3000 health. 

The test in my opinion is being able to consistently survive that long, or if you just use ancient arrows I guess. Those seem super expensive so I haven't used them or bought them.

There's ways to reduce damage from guardian attacks as well. "

It works across any distance. Selecting ""Take"" would also warp her directly to you at any stable.

It seems your horse is hard coded to be associated with you when its out. Even if your horse dies, there is a way to revive them."
