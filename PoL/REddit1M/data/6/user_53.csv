I won't spoil where it is unless you ask, but somewhere in the world is an entity that will let you trade in your stamina upgrades for heart containers and vice-versa for a nominal fee. I used that to get just enough strength to pull the Master Sword, then traded my containers back for stamina again, playing the sword for a chump."
