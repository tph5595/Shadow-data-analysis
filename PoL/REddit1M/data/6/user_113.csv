Just a note that I personally am someone who played Skyrim and got bored after 2 hours, and played Xenoblade Chronicles and almost entirely avoided any sidequests that sent me out of my way. Open world games have never really gripped me before, as you can probably tell.

That said, this game changes everything. Never before have I felt so compelled to 100% a game. I'm picking up every sidequest I see. I'm making sure every chest I encounter is emptied. Taking out every moblin camp I find and looting it...

I'm even trying to 100% the compendium. And believe me, it's super difficult to do when an enemy you're trying to capture is busy attacking you.

I'm so far behind everyone else I know who's playing but I don't even care. Many issues they've had with the game, I've not had because going the completionist route is so rewarding.

The progression system is great to. There's no leveling. Any advanced battle technique is available to you right from the start of the game. Sheild surfing, perfect dodging. All things you're capable of doing. But the game keeps them from you in such a clever way and the difficulty scaling feels so perfect. I could wander back to the starting area and still feel decently challenged after my stronger weapons have broken."
