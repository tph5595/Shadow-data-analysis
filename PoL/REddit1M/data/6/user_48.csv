9697,"Just stopping in to vent again. I still can't play this game because of crashing on the Wii U. I even bought the digital version to check if it was my disc thats the issue. Nope, digital and hard copy both crash around 10-30min of play time. I also bought a can of compressed air and dusted out the console... And the problem remains. 


I'm seriously at a loss. I dont know what to do. My Wii U has never crashed before up until this game. Tried re installing  the day one patch a million times too. 


At this point I might just wait it out until Switchs are in stock again... And start over from the beginning on a new console."
20828,I know it is. Dont worry I'm not blaming Wii Us. I know this is not a common issue. 
20849,Memory is all fine. I have like 4 gigs free. 
20883,I have like 4 gigs free. Before I downloaded digital I had 15gb free.

25074,It's never happened to me either until this game. Perfect gaming all the way up until Breath of the Wild. 
29573,Just did that. Crashed in 6 minutes.... Lol. Fuck me. 
220028,"Well, for what it's worth, I was eventually wanting to get a Switch down the line anyways. Plus, I'm planning selling my disc copy to someone, and using a store deal to trade in games and make the Switch cheaper. 

I know it's going a little far, but I don't mind. I'm going to call up Nintendo soon for a refund on the digital as well. At least try to explain my situation and I think they might do it. "
