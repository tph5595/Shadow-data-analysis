11491,I'm at the 2nd divine beast boss. Is there a way to level my swords up or increase the max inventory? All my swords are between 30-60. Every time this guy melees I block with my sword but his I have no time to attack him unless I break his shield and this damages all my swords. Help? I've been trying to beat this guy for like 5 hours
14689,Like be able to keep more swords in my inventory instead of having to switch them out all the time
18459,No sir! Please elaborate. Does this apply towards bows and shields?
18834,How many per expansion?
