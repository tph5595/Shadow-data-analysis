7054,"I found the Bridge of Hylia last night and I was really excited and started to cross over it. It was nighttime in-game too and out of the corner of my eye and I saw some yellow, and when I turned it was a freaking lightning dragon there just lazily circling around the lake. It was so close I got an amazing picture of its face with the camera rune. The music changed to something calm and sedate and I literally just stood there watching it and dodging the little lightning balls. It was one of the most amazing moments I've ever had in a game, and I went back the next 'night' to do it again."
