83126,I thought you could only stasis metal objects?

Last night, I got the the Gerudo dungeon. I have to say, I enjoy the pre-dungeon activities MUCH better than the Zora pre-dungeon. The Zora pre-dungeon is set up more like a TP quest while the Gerudo  dungeon is set up like a OoT quest. You even get this cool mini-dungeon in between. "

The mini-dungeon right before that was really cool, though. I hope I'll be able to stumble upon some mini  dungeons like that just by exploring. "

If they had voice acted every line in the game, I'd have been pretty mad."
