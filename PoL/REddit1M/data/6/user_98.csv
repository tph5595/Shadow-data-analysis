29040,I also like the manipulation of the trunk spraying water as a small call-back to traditional Water Temples.
29201,"After running out of arrows once and dying, then going away to stock up, try again, and running out of arrows again, I realized there had to be a way to beat him without arrows.  Milpha gave me some clues during the fight and then I clicked about using Cryonis to defend and Stasis to create an offense.  I'm assuming now that you can beat all the Divine Beast bosses using Runes."
29390,Think about what runes you have.
29556,"I just cant figure out where they got these people?

There is a wealth of voice talent out there, even if you ignore the big names (which they definitely should; as much as I love them I don't want to hear Nolan North as a Zora and Troy Baker as a Goron and Jennifer Hale as Zelda).  How did they get such a middling cast and uninspired direction?

All that said, having extra stamina is fantastically useful but I don't feel like you need that much more?  I'm at three stamina upgrades, and once I complete the single extra wheel I don't think I'll get any more until my hearts are at max."
29924,"I took the Friday off on Switchmas and played Zelda all day, then all day and all night Saturday, then all day Sunday, then all night Monday...  it's probably going to slow down now but I'm probably a good 40 hours in.

Loving every minute, have completed one Beast (Zora) and I think I'm basically about to enter the Goron Beast.  I've done a shit load of exploration otherwise though - I spent a lot of time in Akalla (getting to its Tower was incredible) and also in the Great Hyrule Forest to the north.  Did the extra forest north of that too, and have focused a lot on sidequests.

Side question:  how are people logging their time?  I don't see a playtime record either on the Switch system or on my game file."

30885,So far I've been able to climb anything I need to with just three upgrades.  It helps to have the bandanna on and unequip all your gear.
31137,How can you be a topless rock climber while wearing a shirt?  I'm confused.
