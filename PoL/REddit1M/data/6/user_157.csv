79350,"Spoilers for the zora quest (just beat it for my first one done) and probably the other main quests:

[So I'm about 20 hours in and finally went to complete the zora storyline and vah ruta. I had been playing under the assumption that all of the guardians were asleep within the divine beasts, like Link was. I liked mipha from the start of the storyline, much more than a certain annoying ruto love interest from the past, and was okay with her and link being a love interest (I came in hoping for something like Link and zelda in skyward sword). So, I looked forward to them being together after I restored the divine beast. So yeah the feels hit strong as soon as I realized Mipha was a spirit like the king :(] (/spoiler)"
