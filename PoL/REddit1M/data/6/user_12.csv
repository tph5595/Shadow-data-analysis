2297,"Would anyone like to give me some pointers on combat? Prior to beating my first Divine Beast (Vah Ruta), it took me a solid hour, hour-and-a-half just to defeat the Lynel (I couldn't just stealth-collect the shock arrows because I am stubborn and dumb). 

I know those guys are the baddest of the bad in the game, but it seemed like my backwards flips never triggered the flurry rush - only when I jumped to the side.

Is there a cue I should be listening (or looking) for, or is there something I can do for practice? I suspect this is why I was getting destroyed in the [Adjective] Tests of Strength shrines as well.

Thanks!"
3010,"Thanks! As long as I dodge the attack(s) against a Guardian, the flurry rush will trigger? 

Are there other combat techniques (perhaps later in the game that I haven't yet come across) that I should pursue? I learned about the slo-mo archery on complete accident during the Lynel fight.

Thanks again!"
5442,"Nice, thanks! I completely forgot about parry attacks. I guess I got used to being hand-held by Wind Waker and how it gave you a sensory (through the rumble), auditory, *and* visual cue, haha."
5542,"I've come to appreciate cooking in this game for sure. I made something with meat, rock salt, and radishes and it gave me something like 13 hearts + 3 yellow ones. It felt like a bit of a waste given that I only have 5 hearts (now that I got a container from the Ruta dungeon), but it seems like my next big task is to experiment with elixirs. Thanks again!"
5804,"Huh, I'll have to try that next time! I used Cryonis a lot to bust up the ice he throws at you (and to build barriers when he threw his spear) and shot at him from a distance with shock arrows. Your strategy probably would have saved me a solid 15 minutes on the boss fight. Really creative strategy - thanks!"
5928,"I did it with 4. Use Cryonis (and apparently Statis - I didn't think about using this because I thought it was only for metal and concrete - see above for strategy) and invest in arrows.

Doing this boss first seems to be a good idea based on the reward you earn upon beating it."
8045,"Whoa, this was really thorough. Thank you! I'm not sure if I have that specific tunic, but I got the one from Impa after I recalled a memory. I appreciate the breakdown of weapon types, too. Thanks!"
9888,"I read on here that a shield (and even a soup lid) can deflect their beam attacks, so I'll have to keep practicing! Thanks!"
