700,"Once you finish building Terrey Town there's an armor merchant that lets you buy back armor you've dropped or sold! But at 4,000 rupees a pop! Where do you get the barbarian armor tho btw?"
931,"Been playing since Friday for long hour sessions each day and I've barely finished one of the dungeons (Zora). Idk which one to do next! I also finally finished the map of hyrule, and have done over 50 shrines. This game is insane, I love finding all the armor sets and upgrading them (the climber's gear has made exploring so much easier). Thinking about exploring hyrule castle for treasure after I figure out what region I should head to next for a dungeon."
