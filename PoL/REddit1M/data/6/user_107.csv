33228,"Voice? Perhaps.
Character? Best in the game. ;("
33413,"Yep. I found a pretty great tip is that in the southeastern part of the map, at the most south eastern tower (it's in a jungle), you can warp to a tower. Jumping off of the tower to the east (I think) puts you on a couple of tiered ledges with trees that have a TON of hearty durians. Cooking one of these alone gives full heart recovery and 4 bonus hearts, so there's definitely value in grabbing 10-15 of these in about 2 minutes and cooking them up, especially with a larger hp bar."
33654,"I definitely agree. The story in this game was very very weak. I compare it to the last console Zelda, SS, which was basically all story, with the entire backstory of hyrule. I feel like they totally nailed character interactions in this game, but the story feels really generic. It doesn't have very many iconic characters (all I can think of is Sidon and maybe the champions), compared to Twilight Princess or Skyward Sword's great and varied casts."
33719,Key note is that each labyrinth has a barbarian item. Attack boosts ftw.
33807,It's not scripted. It's just luck that it walked up to you.
33901,"It's just for inventory. But there are diminishing returns. The first upgrade costs 1 seed, followed by 2, followed by 3, followed by 5, followed by 8. So, as you can see, the number of seeds you needs drastically increases as you start upgrading things."
34012,"He gradually moves towards his final location, so take that as what you will. He moves along a river northwards from his first location (road to Kakariko), but you can just find him in the final location that he says he'll go to and start getting upgrades then."
34044,Treasure cave? Tell me more... :)
34101,"1 thing per expansion. But the number of korok seeds it costs increases. 1 for the first upgrade, then 2, then 3, then 5, then 8 seeds, and so on. So, really huge case of diminishing returns."
