204,"Probably the wrong place to ask, but I sold a barbarian chest piece earlier in my play through not realising you can only get one. Is there any way to get another one? If you can't, it sucks :/"
1214,"Thanks. No idea what Terrey Town is but I'm sure I'll find it. I've only downed one of the Divine Beasts so far and just finished unlocking the entire map. I found it in the labyrinth in the desert. Bottom right of the desert. I found the helmet in the labyrinth in the top right of the map, haven't found the legs yet. "

Not to mention the amount of money I spend on arrows. This game is great for distracting you from your goal."
5759,I already mentioned the one in the top right of the map. It's above Robbie's forge. The last labyrinth containing the boots is in the top left of the map.
