68884,"Just beat the Zora beast and I'm curious.  Does the trident break like every other weapon?  Are there key items in this game like the hookshot? Having beaten my first temple I'm absolutely loving this game but I feel like I'm missing my prize from the water temple... if the trident breaks it'll be like I only got that (admittedly sweet) revive spell.  Idk i miss the big chest with the key item.  But I understand they went rouge with the formula: key dungeon item means one strategy for the boss... and it's amazing there are multiple ways to kill every boss.  Totally get it, items and weapons feel a little less meaningful though.  Feels like a Souls/scrolls adventure with Zelda accouterments.  Not a diss just an observation.  Seriously love this game so so much, for different reasons than any other Zelda though, so It's hard to compare this with another Zelda game. "
