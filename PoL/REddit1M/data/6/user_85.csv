I've been in love with Dark souls and Bloodborne the past few years I've been a zelda fan since the 80s and I'm so happy Nintendo really hit a thousand home runs with this game it's pleasure to play in every facet possible!"
27895,Yeah I spotted that too! So full of suprise the world is.
29036,This is exactly how I feel about this game. Discovery is just insane and doesn't leave you feeling empty or that you just was 5 hours. The design is impeccable.
