17317,Have you expanded your sword inventory with the korok seeds?
18099,Did you realize that if you unequip your metal items you won't be struck? It'll give you an little insignia during the storm on the item if they conduct electricity. 
18700,"Exactly! Well, you get to choose each time which one you want another slot for. So have you found any korok seeds? The koroks are hiding throughout the land up trees, or if you see a tree stump with a leaf stamp on it that might be a puzzle, or sometimes there might be a block you have to slide into place. Take these to the very large korok on the way to Kakariko village and he will allow you to expand. "
