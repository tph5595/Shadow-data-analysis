52889,"I had to force myself to stop reading Metacritic reviews because they infuriate. I've probably put a good 35ish hours into this game, and I'm super impressed with so many aspects.

Is it just me, or does the memories you chase hit you in the feels every time? To see this emotive, sassy, struggling Zelda for the first time like this is just fantastic. I've focused and chasing these memories down first and foremost and they've been some of my favorite parts thus far.

The little details, down even to the music that everyone keeps complaining about. That first scene [with the king](/spoiler) and the multiple themes that swelled in and out during it... nothing short of magical. Not to mention the other themes that just barely play, enough to hit you right in the nostalgia bone, when you're visiting some of the main areas (Zora, Goron, Rito, even Epona's Song, etc). Hate all you want, but I absolutely love how they deconstructed the classic music we all love.

Not to mention... man oh man is there so much to do. I've put a ridiculous amount of time into games like Fallout and Skyrim, but those titles just haven't gotten the ""you're doing the same stupid fetch quest over and over"" problem down yet. I haven't once felt like that playing this game. I feel like every mountain I climb, every island I explore, every book and cranny has a purpose to it. The Koroks and the shrines are almost just like additives along the way of my adventure, there only to distract me until I head in another direction. Exploring the map, etc, doesn't feel like a chore like most open world games.

There's so much more I could say but I need to stop lol. Maybe I'm just biased, being the Zelda crazy person that I am, but I am truly loving this game in a way I haven't felt in a while. I'm actually struggling forcing myself to do the Divine Beast temples because I don't want the game to end, though I know there's plenty more after. Can't wait to put another mass amount of hours into it ‚ù§"
