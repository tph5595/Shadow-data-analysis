39287,"I was also scared shitless of lynels but i finally bit the bullet and took out the one in the colliseum. I died like 7 times but the trick is have a really strong weapon, and a bunch of tough shields (if you go thru the top theres a ton of dudes w/ royal shields). Basically, always have that shield up and if they are about to yell run the fuck away. You can also stasis them (need upgraded stasis) and whale on em, and that gives you a good chance. "
