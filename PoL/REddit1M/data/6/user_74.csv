16358,"Here's a pro tip for people like me who could only have put like 9 hours in total thanks to work, although it's a good tip in general:

You can perfect parry the big ass guardians and kill them with three shots. The timing is a little hard because they walk real close to you but if you do it right you can go anywhere you want and get a shitload of ancient springs and gears and things like that early on with your super parrying skills.

Good luck!"
