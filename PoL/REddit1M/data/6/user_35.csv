6780,"I'm almost 26 and haven't played a Zelda since OOT. This game is making me feel like 12 again and watching my older brother play. This fucking game, they nailed it. I'm not even that far. Just got to Hateno village. Love the subreddit with all the positivity and everybody helping each other along with blocking spoilers. 

Truly a special game, they only come every once in a while, let's take our time, explore, and enjoy it!"
