8934,"After exploring the Lost Woods, the Thyphlos Ruins, sneaking through ruins of moblins and finding a shrine hidden behind bombable walls in otherwise inconspicuous cliffs, I decided to see what this ""Forgotten Temple"" in my map was.

A colossal canyon stood before me, so I jumped down to the depths. There it was, a massive temple carved into the walls. I went inside, paraglided through endless Guardians, leaving a trail of explosions behind. At the end of these huge ruins, a shrine and a Goddess Statue. Wonderful rewards.

I left the temple, and noticed I didn't have enough stamina to climb the cliffs that surrounded me. So, instead of fast-travel, I followed the canyon floor for miles. On my way I found another shrine, mysterious windmills and a goron who taught me how to play golf.

At the end of the canyon (I spent almost an hour there), I climbed a rocky mountain and found an extremely hidden shrine under the ground - I was in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by nothing but generic rocks, and there was a shrine. Not just any shrine, but the largest shrine I've seen so far, with multiple floors and plenty of almost sadistic air puzzles. Incredible shrine.

Leaving the shrine, I found a Great Fairy Fountain, a ruined citadel with hundreds of collumns and finally the region's tower. At this point I stopped and went to bed.

All of this, from the Lost Woods to the tower near the Ritos, in only 5 hours. 5 hours of non-stop, top-notch adventure. I am about 35 hours into the game and every second so far has been non-stop, top-notch adventure, with surprises and rewards at every turn.

I am in love."
