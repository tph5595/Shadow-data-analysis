44803,"So, I've been playing this game for the past few days now. This is my first Zelda game ever. I am someone who loves turn based RPGs so playing this game is a bit out of my comfort zone. I continue to struggle with the fights, I panic, I keep clicking the wrong buttons because I'm used to the xbox/ps4/pc controllers (which are opposite Nintendo's setup) and I find the scope of the game really overwhelming. Because of this, I find the game drag to play. I don't think this game is for me. 

In addition to being overwhelming I find it repetitive. To me, Zelda Breath of the wild has a similar formula to a lot of Ubisoft open world games. There's a bunch of regions with towers in them. These towers allow you to fast travel between them. The towers act as a home base for all your quests. This repetitive nature is the reason I couldn't get into Shadow of Mordor or Assassin's Creed despite them being rather cool games.  For some reason Skyrim doesn't feel as repetitive as Zelda, shadow of Mordor or assassin's Creed. So in my opinion, Skyrim is still the champion.   "
