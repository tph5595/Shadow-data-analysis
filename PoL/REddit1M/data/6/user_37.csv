I just got the timing down after fighting him for a while, you gotta back flip at the last second.  Also, whenever he backs up and charges at you, make sure you have your shield out (if you're using a 2 handed weapon, put it away so you're holding your shield up.)

Avoid getting out of melee range, because then he'll just pull out his shock arrows and own you (You may actually be able to deflect these with a shield parry.)  Whenever he get's low on health, he'll start to shoot fireballs.  Just run in a circle around him until he stop's shooting fireballs and continue the melee fight and you'll be able to chip him down.  Attack or Defense boosting items will help too.

A much easier strategy is to use the upgraded stasis rune, if you already have it, to stop time on him and just go to town with little to no risk. "
