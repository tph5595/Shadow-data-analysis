4413,Well that's a good idea haha.  
6416,I had six but I think 5 is definitely enough. Just keep trying!
7996,Honestly though just hit him with a rain of arrows. I used all the shock arrows I had then switched between types until I finally ran out and had to throw stuff at him. Just take lots and lots of arrows!
8971,Is anyone else playing without getting a horse? I much prefer running around on my own.
