612433,There's a thunderstorm everyday at four pm in that Island. So I attacked the main monsters camp at that hour. Two moblins were attacked by lighting and then I exploded the fire barrels with bombs to get rid of the other monsters. I love how you can use even the weather to advance in the game.
