62860,"Just beat the game. Probably my favorite Zelda overall. My second favorite story(maybe tied for second, OoT first WW might be tied), but by far my favorite gameplay. I was thrilled that there was *zero* hand holding, and I made it a point to not google anything and figure anything out on my own. It made it so much more satisfying.

A lot of the issues people have with the game, some didn't like the story, some didn't like the sword breaking mechanics, I didn't really have any trouble with. I thought the story was incredible...I thought the concept was amazing and the execution was nearly flawless. When I saw the 12th memory I was right before fighting Ganon, and shit man, I got fired up."

Zelda had a couple off moments, but for the most part that's what I expected her to sound like. Everyone else sounded fine to me too.

I think people are taking their weeb hatred of dubs and translating it here when it doesn't apply. Dubs in anime suck because studios don't have money for good voice actors and it seems weird on anime in general most of the time. Nintendo ain't the type of company to skimp on shit like that, the voice actors did fine imo."
63306,I thought Mipha sounded fine. Sounded like she was a bit shy about confessing her feelings towards another species. Like that's a bit awkward to bring up...
