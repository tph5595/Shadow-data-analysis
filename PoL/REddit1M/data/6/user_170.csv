325655,"I did a lot of what you did in complete reverse. I had just helped the Gerudo with their Devine Beast and floated over in that direction. I came across those windmills and decided to float on down to the bottom of the canyon. There I found the Goron, played some golf the followed the canyon, finding ore and herbs, a shrine or two, a lot of coyotes, bokoblins and moblins and of course koroks. Then I saw the Forgotten Temple, but the guardians scared me off.

That's when I decided to climb over the temple instead since it looked like it had a lot of ledges to rest on. I get up on the roof and the thing was huge, with more ore veins and three or four korok puzzles. One of the korok puzzles was one of the more complicated ones I've seen, but it was the most hidden away. Ended up climbing on and wound up in the snowy far left region and climbed some mountains, did a few more shrines and snagged the frozen tower. 

Now I need to find the lost woods and trade in more of these korok seeds."
