11459,"Made it to the Gerudo Desert last night and got both towers in the region. Also managed to infiltrate Gerudo Town and I've got to say that I am in love with the depiction of the Gerudo in this game. They live a harsh life in the desert so they wear clothing and engage in militant lifestyles that best help them survive, but there's also a number of skilled merchants, and then a random treasure hunter, and an archaeologist, and not all of them like living in the desert. But then there's the factor that male children are so Hyliadamned rare that they have entire courses on how to pursue relationships and get married so they can have kids. Reminds me a bit of the Asari actually. This is so much better than how they were in Ocarina and I think I might be a bit smitten. 

And they all look different too! They have ranges in skin tone (including one surprisingly pale Gerudo captain) and hair design and body type while still maintaining the standard features of Ganondorf's people. It's the single best improvement of a race in Hyrule since the Zora of Ocarina. 

But then they have sand seals because... Why not! And the desert is gorgeous. My wife is a native of the California desert and she was awestruck by this corner of the map. And she cheered that the desert was actually hot in the daytime but freezing at night like it should be. 

I'm infiltrating the Yiga now (heh, sounds like Yuga) and having a bit of a tough time since you have to be so stealthy and for once guards actually leave their patrol routes to come after you if they think they see something. I need to use more bananas. 

I love this game so much. I need to go climb more mountains though. Sticking to the roads a lot. "
