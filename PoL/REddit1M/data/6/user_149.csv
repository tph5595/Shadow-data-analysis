68775,"Day 3. Decided to try that shrine off the coast. I got  some food, a resistance potion, 2 fairies, 78 wooden arrows, some decent weapons (lightining sword and cavalier sword the best ones), 4 shields and hero's cape.
Oh, and 5 hearts total.
Ok, advanced strenght trial does not bode well, but everybody says I was a freakin' hero a hundred years ago so...how difficukt can it be?!
....yeah, those bigass weapons of his might just be for show...
..or not.
....
12 minutes later there's just two columns, the damned guardian still has about a thousand hps,  I'm down to my cavalier sword, 20 arrows and almost no food......and the sonofabitch starts targeting me with a cannon?!?!
...
(After 2 minutes of avoiding and trying to get close) Ok he has 350 hp left and my last sword deals around 50 per reeeeally slow swing, so it's around 7 hits to go....but one shot up close and I'm done for so the question is: can I avoid the 3 shots, get close enough and deal 7 blows before he recharges and blows me to smithereens?
Ok, go!
..he grazes me, and I'm down to half a heart..
1..2..3...miss....4......5.......cavalier sword is about to break...6....shiiiiiiiiiiiiit!!!!!!...
...and 7.
Sword broke on last hit: he's down.
On first try.
WITH 5 HEARTS TOTAL.
I do feel like a hero, a bit.
This is The Videogame.
It's pure wonder.
..and most of all, I get exactly the same feeling I got 26 years ago, first time I put that golden cartight into my beloved NES.

BotW: just passed the advanced strenght trials..with 5 hearts!!!!!! https://imgur.com/gallery/sY5Aq"
