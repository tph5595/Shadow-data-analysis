6068,"I'm probably only about 25 hours in, but God I'm loving the hell out of this game.

Spent the first 15 or so hours just dicking around exploring, doing shrines and stuff. Then finally decided to do a dungeon which ended up being the Zora one first. Must say that I love the new dungeon dynamic where it is more of a puzzle than previous games and no fighting. 

After this I made my way to the Gorons and did that dungeon too. Very much in love with the build-up to both of them.

Finally I went back to some dicking around and exploring and I found the Master Sword after the Goron chief mentioned it, but I don't have enough hearts to draw it yet. Gonna head west now and scout out the rest of the map and probably spend the next 10 hours just exploring before going to whichever dungeon is closest.

This feels so good to type out, hopefully people will read it. Nobody I know plays Zelda and this is such a wonderful experience I just need to talk about it.

6301,Are you playing the WiiU version to know such specific time? I can't seem to find gameplay stats on the Switch.
6425,I literally just found it after getting a hint from the Goron chief :)
6689,Haha wow man that's intense. You've probably got at least double that left with just exploring and completing stuff.
7049,"I just finished my second dungeon. I still feel like I have to cheese the bosses with elemental arrows rather than going hand to hand. Was there a time in the game when you started to feel badass enough to go head to head?

As far as moblins/bokoblins/lizalfos go I can H2H them easy even when there are a group. But the prospect of guardians or lynels just makes me want to run and hide."
7682,"I did Water then Fire. The water one was rough, I kinda did a hybrid H2H and Arrow cheese against it. The second was fire which I just basically hid behind the console and killed him with 30 Ice Arrows lol.

I loathe electricity in Zelda games, I'm scared now.

I killed my first guardian today with the ancient arrow someone gave me. Haven't gotten around to finding this other lab to get more yet though, so I've got nothing to kill them with yet. I heard you can tip them with the buff horse, but I've yet to try. Speaking of the buff horse, that was my first Lynel experience, there's a couple in that valley which I sprinted past on the way out getting the horse to the stable.

Fuck this game is amazing."
7806,I got struck the fuck down by lightning in a storm. It was brutal. I can't say enough good things about this game.
