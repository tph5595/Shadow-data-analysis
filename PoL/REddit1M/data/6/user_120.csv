47166,"Finding Rito village reaally took a long time. I enjoyed every bit of it. I was balancing through these wood planks on cliff sides and accomplished a side quest i forgot i accepted. I finally got all divine beasts and compared to waterblight ganon, everything else was easier. I'm completing the Korok trials right now cuz I still dont have enough hearts for the master sword. My goal right now is to find all the shrines to increase health and stamina so im ready for that motherfucker ganon

Edit:
