773,"I'm just not progressing closer to Ganon, it feels like. I don't mind it very much, getting distracted just, happens. Plan yesterday was to tackle Vah Medoh, but it just didn't happen. I unlocked a fair amount of towers though and approached Hyrule Castle for one of the memories, which was both terrifying and stunning. The music is incredible. It being so minimal in the overworld really adds some weight to it. 

Something pretty cool though; I freed a horse from a Bokoblin and used it to get close to Hyrule Castle, went inside, got the memory and when I left, probably a day later in-game, the horse was still there where I left him. I took him back to the stable with me. 

Found the Master Sword after tripping over my own feet in the Lost Woods for about an hour and a half. Eugh, shrine farming. The quests in the Korok Forest are so cool though, I'm having fun. I'm just hoping I can leave while on horseback. I brought Epona with me and I don't want to lose her here. I'm thinking I'll just do some strategic exchanging with the statue in Hateno to get two extra hearts and just farm the rest. 

So when I get home after work today I'm not sure what to approach first; Master Sword or Vah Medoh. Either is gonna be tough as nails."

3158,"Alright, thanks! I really need to tackle more shrines tbh."
10921,"Yep, I took him with and had him boarded! I was so surprised he stuck around. Good horse, best friend."
11016,"This will probably happen, but it's good to set goals for yourself. I think."
11217,"Just bolt it when it happens. The blademasters are assholes, the archers are manageable. They slow down in number eventually but I haven't found out yet how to make it stop as a whole."
11279,If you're low on memory it might be worth looking into expanding. Dunno how much that'll help but it's worth a shot I think.
17239,"Yep, I know about that! Ill still be a bit short though, so I need to complete some extra shrines regardless, but I'm gonna do that once I'm done in the forest. Thanks though!"
101948,"Hylian shield does break but it has like, 800 endurance, so it takes a while and you can find multiple around Hyrule. The master sword doesn't break, but has an use limit followed by a cooldown timer, and then you can use it again!"
