8627,"I have only two problems with this game.

***One is the voice acting:*** The english dub is absolute bokoblin guts. Voices don't fit their characters, the inflections are wrong for the emotions portrayed, and there is no direction toward their intent. So monotone...

***Second is that you can't sit in chairs:*** It seems like a small thing, but as Skyrim has taught me, sitting down is a great way to change pace. The fact that I can't sit down at an inn irritates me far more than it should, but I can say that it would certainly do wonders for immersion."

I like voice acting, I just hate the way the actors portrayed the voices. It feels like they're reading the script for the first time with little to no context."

97274,"I've been hearing Zelda's voice more and more, and I feel like her voice gets better throughout the game. In some of the memories, her voice acting is actually pretty decent!"
97519,"While I found the Old Man's voice actor to be great, I feel that the voice itself was wrong for the role. Y'know what I mean?"
