16767,If you haven't beaten him yet (or for anyone else having trouble with this boss or any other) cook up some food that increases your hearts. By this point in the game you should've passed by some things that will allow you to do that. Makes this fight a bit easier. You could also cook something that increases defense. Make sure you're stocked up on arrows and/or have a decent weapon. Good luck! :)
