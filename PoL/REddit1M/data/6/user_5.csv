894,I beat the game last night at just over 54 hours. I'm just amazed by how well this game was crafted and well-thought out. I can't wait to dive back in after work and just wander Hyrule and find more Shrines and sidequests.
3230,I have 15 hearts and the entirety of the map was accessed/all towers visited around the 48 hour mark

I believe you can track Switch playtime with the Parental App on mobile"
6807,"yup, I can't wait to just fool around and see where the world takes me. I just wanted to beat the game before I had to go back to work so I wouldn't be sitting at my desk fretting over lack of closure"
7337,"I think the only boss I ever went totally ham on and brute forced was the last one (which for me was the fire boss). I got my ass absolutely kicked by the Electric one for like 3 hours straight before I finally figured out how to beat the damn thing. Water was my first, I was really understocked and used a lot of puzzle-y shit to get my way through it. Wind was pretty straight forward for me, I think it's the only one of the four I beat in one try (as with final boss, I somehow beat that in one try despite crying lol)

Moblins/Bokoblins/Lizalfos I've been taking on no problem. I still scream like a little girl when I see a Guardian despite the fact that I can kill them now. 

I do not fuck around with Lynels. I might actually be able to beat them now, but I still remember the shock arrow fetch quest so no thanks. "
7919,"Water I used the ice rune to create a shield for when he was about to attack me with a lance so it would break his weapon and then I'd zoom in to wail on him. Back off and hit arrows until he tried to hit me again. Second phase I would shoot him in the eye to break his ice throws then dive in the water when he threw the lance :D Water was also my first and man was that a learning curve for me. That fight made me understand the game much better :D

Yeah I want to get to the point that Guardians don't phase me... I'm aiming for three years :P They scary ;-;

Anytime I see a Lynel I cry myself to sleep"
17466,"short answer: yes 

long answer: 

[it takes you back to your last save/right before you fight Ganon. Your save is now marked with a star going forward. You never play post game per se, but it does acknowledge you've beaten the game](/spoiler)
