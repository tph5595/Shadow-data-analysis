14457,One thing that really impressed me about that dungeon is an incredible feeling of presence in the world. It's not like older games where you have a bunch rooms sealed off in a mountain somewhere or whatever Tardis level magic was going on with JabuJabu's belly. There's windows all over the thing that let you see out into the world not to mention the shenanigans that you pull off with his trunk. I can't wait to see what they do for the other dungeons. 
14738,Just went to a random island off the coast only for it turn into a Robinson crusoe shrine challenge where I had to fend for myself without any equipment. Definitely the most involved shrine I've seen so far. To the point I'm disappointed I only got one orb out of it.
