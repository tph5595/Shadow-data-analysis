I ended up paragliding onto his belly from the mob post nearby, and stole the ball from necklace. He stayed asleep the whole time, until I ran over his crotch and hit the ground running. I never looked back and booked it up the path to deliver the ball to the pedestal. He disappeared after that, and I was quite thankful for that.

I did this trial and the ""moderate"" and ""major"" tests of strength trials nearby with five total heart containers. It felt incredibly rewarding all around."
