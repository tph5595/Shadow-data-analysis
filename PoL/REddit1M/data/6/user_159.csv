79918,"I have my first major complaint of the game. I still think it's outstanding, but, I'm pretty disappointed in the main dungeons. In a game that is as epic as this, for the levels to all be--and maybe I'm wrong here--'go inside the giant robot animal' is a bit of a let down. Dungeons are my favorite part of Zelda. I love how they each have their own distinct feel. I love how they have a lore attached to them. Ancient elemental temples, tucked away in their regions and elements? Venturing deep into a volcano temple, or down to the bottom of a lake, or onto an ancient pirate ship, or into a desert prison, or down the mouth of a giant fish--and the way each one had a theme and a feel. I don't know. I was really excited to see this amazing game's amazing temples, and the fact that every one is 'inside the robot,' I presume that each one has a similar aesthetic and feel. 

I still love the game, but this is a bit of a bummer. Unless I'm wrong. I've only just entered Vah Ruto. But I thought I was saving/releasing it, not going inside of it.

Anyway. Still love the game much. Just one thing I don't care for. "
