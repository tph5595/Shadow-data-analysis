34904,"I think I am around 40+ hours in at the moment, just did my second main dungeon. I got a funny irl story, I was playing the whole weekend and started working again on Monday, I hated it with passion. So I pretty much made jokes ""-Insertnamehere- can't you break both my legs so I can stay at home and play Zelda?"" and ""I really hope I get sick."" It all was jokes even though it was a nightmare to not play the darn game. Come tuesday and I went out for lunch to eat at IKEA, on the way I slip on some ice (it looked like ground since it was gray) and I sprained my ankle. So now I am off on sick leave and can play the game all I want, irony isnt it. So tomorrow I am sitting and doing the million side quests I have in my log, cant wait!"
