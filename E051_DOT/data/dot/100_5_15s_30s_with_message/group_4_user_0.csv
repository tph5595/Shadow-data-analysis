1683907684,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"As we all know, side quests in BOTW are sort of ""forgettable"", plus they have horrible rewards. No matter what you do, the rewards are simple items, rupees.... or. That's it, just those. 

Here's my very simple theory on why:

The world is a real world. If you do something for someone in real life, what will they give you? Their cars? A Switch? A special amiibo? No.

People who you do favors for in the real world may invite you to a thank you dinner or give you money for your troubles.

The designers didn't want the people to know about Shrines, hearts, inventories that are infinite, nothing. They wanted people to be just people.

I'm not sure this approach is the best one (or if this is true), but this is just a theory. A game theory."
1683907685,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"I usually did as well, because I knew the result would be useless... but I couldn't help myself wanting to show that kid all those weapons, he was so happy, or the love Gerudo-Hylian couple at the lake, among some other cool ones. The rewards were weak, but the little life tidbits on the people were great."
1683907685,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,They rushed the game out? I found 1 game breaking bug in the whole world. Have you played actually rushed games? I think they just didn't invest enough money in them to have great rewards.
1683907686,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,I've completed most I could find. To say a few good other examples - Finding the Eighth statue of the Gerudo warrior woman (or something) was a thrill. Leviathan bones? Wonderful! The reward was bad but finding the bones is an experience in itself.
1683907686,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,I think I'll probably do the same thing. Not avoiding them right now but I'm just focusing on shrines and such. 105 so far.
1683907686,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"I probably had a different experience than you - I found so much to do, everything felt new and exciting. The memories, korok seeds, shrines, all the characters, the bothersome Yiga people, all the sidequests, locations, little monster locations. If you know anything about game development, you know this game had a lot of value put into it, the world feels alive. They need to release at least 4-8 more monster types honestly, but BOTW is all about that negative space being used correctly.

I understand where you're coming from, but I disagree with your opinion. Not trying to make it less valid - everyone's experience is different."
1683907686,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"It's not too Zelda, that's true. I always have that argument with myself. "
1683907687,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"Not just that, 900 korok seeds? All the positionings in the little rock mines? All the hidden chests? My dad has played for 150 hours! And he hasn't had ONE bug. He's extremely casual so any weird thing he would've complained. Not just that - I also have well over 100 hours, only one time I clipped into a wall and that's because I tried really hard and could only do it once (got off a horse in a specific wall in a specific angle). Bugs man, bugs are the definition of whether a game is rushed or not. Specially for open world games. 

"
1683907687,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"They're not - Tarry Town and about 10-15 other quests were on par with Anju and Kafei or Biggoron. Thing is Majora's Mask was BUILT around sidequests. Also Biggoron's Sword is a major weapon in the game, the only other weapon aside from Master Sword and Hero's Bow that Link actually wields.... well, Hammer I guess too... and Boomerang. But those are not fight worthy."
1683907694,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,The locations are all planned out. Do you really think that's how a game of this scope is made? Copy paste? 
1683907694,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"Agreed. I found many things while side questing, not necessarily rewards, that were rewarding. The locations, the views, the small stories. "
1683907695,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"They're not as precisely planned, but the environment has to be very very exact for them to exist. The rocks are usually located on interesting places for the circle puzzles, the ones where you have to put them inside a rock circle in the water are few and far between . The ones where you have to reach a spot are planned, most require a specific mechanic. The balloon popping ones aren't planned? They all have special movement patterns, different numbers. I'm gonna tell ya: at least an intern was tasked with putting them in. Game development has no copy paste. Specially in the scope of 900 puzzles that can't overlap or be too close. "
1683907695,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"I think you're the Korok seed guy! And yeah, making a game is about following ideas and implementing them in a consistent way. They set out to break conventions in zelda and create a world that felt incredible. I think they achieved it. "
1683907695,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Dude. Find the giant horse quest! 
1683907695,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"They need to push some extra story, I agree with ya"
1683907695,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Which quest was this? 
1683907696,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"Also, for them, fruits can be rare and expensive. They don't know the effects on you. (going with my small theory) "

1683907703,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,I agree with you. You want to just be free. Free! 
1683907704,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,I will confess to you I was mad at the end of ALL THE MEMORY Hunting to not get anything for it. But the experience of the memories was so satisfying. So memorable. I may be weak in the knees for Zelda as a series? But I felt goosebumps in some of them. 
1683907704,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Lol what. Why would I make excuses for someone else? 
1683907704,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,This is a theory. 
1683907704,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"They were indeed game objectives that were beyond the main game story. So they were side Quests. This game isn't just meant for hard-core gamers, the easy shrines make lots of sense when I see my dad playing. People don't see that on their fancy reviews. "
1683907704,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Agreed on your two examples. The house was a nice addition. Also Beedle gives potions for his beetles. Others could've done similar stuff. But I feel people would STILL complain.

1683907705,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"Dude, yeah. I think that was to make the game a bit more accessible to newer people. My dad will never solve Tarry Town, but he could solve 'hey kid bring me 55 shrooms'. "
1683907705,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Yup I knew that after I finished :) but that was fifty hours later. 
1683907705,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Hahaha but it was good! I escaped so hard. 
1683907705,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"That's also true. But I see it as budget allocation in this case. The budget went to physics, world building, art, seamless loading, etc. "
1683907706,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"This is my point in some discussions - I myself had some issues because I game a lot, at the start I went against a Major Test of Strength with 3 hearts and weak weapons, I did Eventide Island with 3 hearts and no divine beasts, among other great experiences. My dad? Yeah no. He had to farm really hard. Hard. Still after having everything, sword, powers from the beasts he can't beat a Lynel without using Urbosa three times. 

Then we see major reviewers saying there's too many free or easy shrines? I wish there was a way to sit them with a bad player and see them suffer through the mid difficulty ones. "

1683914781,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"As we all know, side quests in BOTW are sort of ""forgettable"", plus they have horrible rewards. No matter what you do, the rewards are simple items, rupees.... or. That's it, just those. 

Here's my very simple theory on why:

The world is a real world. If you do something for someone in real life, what will they give you? Their cars? A Switch? A special amiibo? No.

People who you do favors for in the real world may invite you to a thank you dinner or give you money for your troubles.

The designers didn't want the people to know about Shrines, hearts, inventories that are infinite, nothing. They wanted people to be just people.

I'm not sure this approach is the best one (or if this is true), but this is just a theory. A game theory."
1683914783,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"I usually did as well, because I knew the result would be useless... but I couldn't help myself wanting to show that kid all those weapons, he was so happy, or the love Gerudo-Hylian couple at the lake, among some other cool ones. The rewards were weak, but the little life tidbits on the people were great."
1683914783,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,They rushed the game out? I found 1 game breaking bug in the whole world. Have you played actually rushed games? I think they just didn't invest enough money in them to have great rewards.
1683914783,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,I've completed most I could find. To say a few good other examples - Finding the Eighth statue of the Gerudo warrior woman (or something) was a thrill. Leviathan bones? Wonderful! The reward was bad but finding the bones is an experience in itself.
1683914783,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,I think I'll probably do the same thing. Not avoiding them right now but I'm just focusing on shrines and such. 105 so far.
1683914783,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"I probably had a different experience than you - I found so much to do, everything felt new and exciting. The memories, korok seeds, shrines, all the characters, the bothersome Yiga people, all the sidequests, locations, little monster locations. If you know anything about game development, you know this game had a lot of value put into it, the world feels alive. They need to release at least 4-8 more monster types honestly, but BOTW is all about that negative space being used correctly.

I understand where you're coming from, but I disagree with your opinion. Not trying to make it less valid - everyone's experience is different."
1683914784,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"It's not too Zelda, that's true. I always have that argument with myself. "
1683914784,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"Not just that, 900 korok seeds? All the positionings in the little rock mines? All the hidden chests? My dad has played for 150 hours! And he hasn't had ONE bug. He's extremely casual so any weird thing he would've complained. Not just that - I also have well over 100 hours, only one time I clipped into a wall and that's because I tried really hard and could only do it once (got off a horse in a specific wall in a specific angle). Bugs man, bugs are the definition of whether a game is rushed or not. Specially for open world games. 

"
1683914785,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"They're not - Tarry Town and about 10-15 other quests were on par with Anju and Kafei or Biggoron. Thing is Majora's Mask was BUILT around sidequests. Also Biggoron's Sword is a major weapon in the game, the only other weapon aside from Master Sword and Hero's Bow that Link actually wields.... well, Hammer I guess too... and Boomerang. But those are not fight worthy."
1683914791,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,The locations are all planned out. Do you really think that's how a game of this scope is made? Copy paste? 
1683914791,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"Agreed. I found many things while side questing, not necessarily rewards, that were rewarding. The locations, the views, the small stories. "
1683914792,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"They're not as precisely planned, but the environment has to be very very exact for them to exist. The rocks are usually located on interesting places for the circle puzzles, the ones where you have to put them inside a rock circle in the water are few and far between . The ones where you have to reach a spot are planned, most require a specific mechanic. The balloon popping ones aren't planned? They all have special movement patterns, different numbers. I'm gonna tell ya: at least an intern was tasked with putting them in. Game development has no copy paste. Specially in the scope of 900 puzzles that can't overlap or be too close. "
1683914792,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"I think you're the Korok seed guy! And yeah, making a game is about following ideas and implementing them in a consistent way. They set out to break conventions in zelda and create a world that felt incredible. I think they achieved it. "
1683914792,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Dude. Find the giant horse quest! 
1683914793,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"They need to push some extra story, I agree with ya"
1683914793,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Which quest was this? 
1683914793,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"Also, for them, fruits can be rare and expensive. They don't know the effects on you. (going with my small theory) "
1683914793,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Gotcha. I respect that.

1683914800,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,The thunder helm was extremely strong! I feel maybe parts of a suit for each town's bundles of quests.
1683914800,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Congratulations and see you on the other side. 
1683914801,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Skyrim had more to do maybe but the bugs were rampant. 
1683914801,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,I agree with you. You want to just be free. Free! 
1683914801,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,I will confess to you I was mad at the end of ALL THE MEMORY Hunting to not get anything for it. But the experience of the memories was so satisfying. So memorable. I may be weak in the knees for Zelda as a series? But I felt goosebumps in some of them. 
1683914801,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Lol what. Why would I make excuses for someone else? 
1683914801,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,This is a theory. 
1683914802,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"They were indeed game objectives that were beyond the main game story. So they were side Quests. This game isn't just meant for hard-core gamers, the easy shrines make lots of sense when I see my dad playing. People don't see that on their fancy reviews. "
1683914802,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Agreed on your two examples. The house was a nice addition. Also Beedle gives potions for his beetles. Others could've done similar stuff. But I feel people would STILL complain. 
1683914802,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Some other comments on this thread have amazing insight on my idea's ramifications. I urge you to read them. 
1683914802,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"Dude, yeah. I think that was to make the game a bit more accessible to newer people. My dad will never solve Tarry Town, but he could solve 'hey kid bring me 55 shrooms'. "
1683914802,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Yup I knew that after I finished :) but that was fifty hours later. 
1683914802,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,Hahaha but it was good! I escaped so hard. 
1683914803,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"That's also true. But I see it as budget allocation in this case. The budget went to physics, world building, art, seamless loading, etc. "
1683914803,102.0.0.30,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource4.html,"This is my point in some discussions - I myself had some issues because I game a lot, at the start I went against a Major Test of Strength with 3 hearts and weak weapons, I did Eventide Island with 3 hearts and no divine beasts, among other great experiences. My dad? Yeah no. He had to farm really hard. Hard. Still after having everything, sword, powers from the beasts he can't beat a Lynel without using Urbosa three times. 

Then we see major reviewers saying there's too many free or easy shrines? I wish there was a way to sit them with a bad player and see them suffer through the mid difficulty ones. "
