If it were a character like Samus or Mario, I agree it would make no sense and there would  be no reason to change gender as it doesn't make sense with the story.

Personally I would be excited about a gender swap as it would essentially be a new story element (further explaining the specifics of how the reincarnation works in the Zelda universe).

It would be a bit different if they overly feminized a female link (hair farther below the shoulders,  heavy makeup, etc...).  That would just feel cheesy. "
