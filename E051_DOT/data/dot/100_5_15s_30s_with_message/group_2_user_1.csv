1683908646,102.0.0.21,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource2.html,"Eyelashes? Seriously, Eyelashes are't exactly the defining anatomy of a woman or girl.

I look at all the physical and noticeable qualities.  The shape of the legs, the width of the hips and the curvature of hips versus the width of hip to waist ratio, the broadness of the shoulders (Links shoulders in previous games have been broad enough to be masculine, and his hip/waist ratio have been masculine and his legs have been masculinely shaped).

Eyelashes aren't something I'd judge gender on.  Eyebrows, though, would be... and this particular characters eyebrows are thin, like a womans.  Previous Links have had eyebrows that were larger.  Not bushy, per se, but masculine."
1683908646,102.0.0.21,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource2.html,The kind of fan that hinges their fandom upon the gender of the main character is perhaps the kind of fan that the fandom doesn't need.
1683908647,102.0.0.21,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource2.html,"Are we referring to Dante from DMC? Because that particular fandom is way smaller than Zelda, and way younger, and I'm not surprised changing it at this point caused some dissatisfaction.

Of course, there may have been other reasons the reboot failed.  Probably several that had nothing to do with the character change."
1683908648,102.0.0.21,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource2.html,"I think you're confused.  Where did I say that the still images I linked were authentic? 

I'm well aware that still images can be shopped... Which is why I said ""I can post still images too"".

My determination as to the femaleness of the character isn't based on the still images, they're based on frames from the original video."
1683908649,102.0.0.21,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource2.html,$10 it's Link and a girl.
1683908650,102.0.0.21,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource2.html,"It was in rebuttal of someone posting a still image and saying ""See? Male"".

If you look at the rest of this thread, you will see where I specify the specific time stamps for the video that indicate the female gender of the protagonist in the video, whether Link or some other girl."
1683908653,102.0.0.21,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource2.html,"And what you don't seem to be understanding is that I wasn't using it as evidence, I was using it as a rebuttal.

In regards to the comparison image of the shopped and unshopped versions, you'll notice in both versions that Link's chest follows a curvature and overlaps the chest strap for the leather across their chest.

Booooob."
1683908659,102.0.0.21,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource2.html,"Wow, your reading comprehension needs some work.

I said that I'd watched the video multiple times.  Then I said that I was going to disagree with you on the subject of this thread; that Link in this video is male.

Also, I'm going to go ahead and ignore your request and do whatever I feel like, because this is the internet, and what are you going to do about it?

You ordering me to not do something is stupid.  Mostly because I was not ""Misleading"" people in this conversation thread.

Get over yourself.  I'm going to continue disagreeing with you as to the gender of the person in the reveal video, because you really seem to be of the same sort who just want it to be a male link for reasons unnamed and unsubstantiated."

1683908702,102.0.0.21,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource2.html,"I've seen two articles on this, both do indeed verify it is link.  However, the non-femaleness of the character is ambiguous, as nowhere does he actually say not female.

He does, however, say not to get hung up on how the character looks.

So I think the answer is still ambiguous, but this is indeed link."
1683908706,102.0.0.21,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource2.html,"Let's be clear; the other articles said that the character in the video wasn't Link based off of Aonuma saying ""No one explicitly said this was Link"".  They were wrong, as Aonuma turned around and is now saying it was in fact Link.

NOW the articles are claiming that Aonuma said that the character wasn't female.  Which is nowhere in anything they quoted.

Considering they were wrong the first time, I think I'm going to wait for more information before deciding that I'm wrong."
