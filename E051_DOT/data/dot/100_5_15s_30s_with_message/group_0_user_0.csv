1683907656,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Ok Witcher 3 is visually flashier... but the actual combat is incredibly simplistic to the point of being trivial. Dodging has a ton of i-frames, Quen is ridiculously overpowered from the beginning, and beyond looking pretty the combat is basically a button masher."

1683907657,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,The signs break the combat. If you are any decent at the game and cast Quen you can get through a lot of fights entirely untouched. Add onto that enemies telegraph their attacks about a month in advance and dodging is extremely fast and makes you invincible for a time and you have an incredibly simple and easy combat system.
1683907657,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"I was listening to the Podquisition (whatever his podcast is called) and he had a friend who was reviewing the game on. She was singing Zelda's praises all the stuff that was great, and she mentions weapon breakage and Jim immediately latched onto that and said that sounded awful, boring, etc. 

He wanted to dislike this game from the start, and like anything someone wants to find a way to dislike, he latched onto the littlest gripes and blew them up."

1683907657,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"The further you progress the *less* they hold true, weapons become pretty high durability. You go from wood weapons lasting a few hits to some metal weapons that will last you multiple enemy camps."
1683907658,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Run into a high level enemy camp and button mash for me, tell me how it goes.

If you're fighting things far below you button mashing is viable, things at your equipment level and above, absolutely not. If you are in the middle of 3-4 enemies you will get annihilated. The game heavily emphasizes strategically attacking camps through environmental weapons, stealth to pick off the sentries, and then using tools like bombs to damage the heavier enemies before going in to finish them off.

Witcher 3 you can... cast Quen and then press light attack a bunch? Maybe dodge once in a while for good measure."
1683907658,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"That's not even remotely true due to dodging i-frames. Also Quen alone will usually do the trick, but one of Quen's first upgrades is a blast that knocks all enemies back when Quen is exhausted, just furthering the OP that is Quen. In Witcher I might get hit occasionally, but it hardly matters because 9 times out of 10 Quen is active anyways. 

Idk, maybe it's because I play a lot fo the Souls series, but Witcher is ungodly easy if you're any kind of decent at dodging. I've also found lock on is more of a detriment than a benefit during combat, I could see multiple enemies being tough if you tried to use the lockon in Witcher, but get rid of it and you can see and anticipate the enemies moves in your surroundings.

1683907659,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"I suppose so, I'm a pretty big proponent of ""gameplay first"" and Witcher 3 just didn't hit that very well imo."
1683907663,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Ehhh I see his point, but he seemed to miss the point of the adventure. If it's raining, try a new route. Sure you could wait it out, but there's always a way there that doesn't involve climbing. They encourage you to find new paths and try new things, and if you resist that I could definitely see it being annoying.

I do agree once you are strong enough there's less need for variety, but I think that's just how games in general work. I could see them fixing that with bonuses for stealthily clearing a camp, or something along those lines, but just by the nature of most games without ""score"" incentive, if you have good equipment you don't have to be that careful.

I'd argue at any point in the game you have to be smart and careful engaging things like silver Lynels though. That's just the games progression system; tough enemies require smart planning, easier enemies dont, and as you progress more and more enemies inevitably fall into the easier category.

In my experience, the challenge does subside a bit as you get used to your old stomping grounds, but you can usually find the challenge again if you look around just a little. Go to the far west and there are long stretches of like 3+ lynels to fight if you're bold."
1683907663,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Exactly! That's one thing I've loved about Dark Souls; you can find interesting weapons but they never feel that OP.

Zelda approaches that in a different, interesting route. You can get OP weapons, but you can't rely on them. You can make things briefly easier but you'll have to keep scavenging weapons if you want to keep it up."
1683907663,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Well yes ""git gud"" is always an option lol, but if you're just good enough then I agree it doesn't really require too much planning.

Idk man, it seems like you give up. Lots of times when it's raining I find a better vantage point and hangglide to my previous goal. If not, I explore one of the other bajillion things right in my vicinity. That's the beauty I think, maybe you can't get that korok on the mountain right now, but just turn around and you'll find another thing to do, and by the time you finish you can probably go get that korok.

The game does discourage certain actions at certain times, but it feels to me like a way of getting you to be more observant and aware of your surroundings, and sometimes that means exploring something entirely different for a bit.

Worst comes to worst, make a campfire and wait til morning to get through the rain. It's only your own creativity that limits what you can do. Sometimes i have felt that ""the games dangling this in my face"" feeling, but I almost always find a solution."

Without the rain I would've just climbed it normally. It's faster and easier, but it's not more fun and it's far less interesting.

Dead Rising is much more of an action game from what I've seen, so it makes sense that weapons last longer, especially when using weapons is really your only main method of fighting.

Zelda tries to encourage players to find different methods of attack, they even have hints and tips on other ways to avoid direct attacks with weapons.

On top of that, high level weapons are extremely durable, it's only really early game that you'll be constantly losing weapons."

If you just think the whole idea of combat is trivial of course you find the weapon system trivial lol. Can you honestly not see how having a Guardian Battleaxe ++ that is unbreakable would just fuck the game? I could maybe respect a repair system, but unless they want to restrict the loot you can get from the beginning, permanent weapons just wouldn't fly.

One thing I thought they should have is an easy mode for players who don't want to deal with breaking equipment. I think that would be an extremely easy game, but some people don't want to deal with the weapon stuff."

I agree the game is fairly easy, but I think that's why weapon durability is important. It adds an element of item management that keeps me engaged even when the combat encounters get less difficult. I know I need some weapons that can hit lightning without shocking me, some ranged weapons, stuff like that, because even with the ease of combat there are some encounters you just can't go in and tank."
1683907816,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"But the game is in some parts trying to have survival elements to it, and item management is integral to survival game. Some people may dislike it but it wouldn't be much of a survival game with unlimited high power weaponry.

Take Minecraft for example: weapons and tools are often easy to break. This adds a layer of depth to the game, because you constantly have to find or craft equipment to survive. Similarly with Zelda you have to keep finding equipment. I think one way they could make this better would be enemy encounters that you can't just run away from, and some which are just sprung on you, sort of like the Khoga tribe enemies."

So if having too many weapons is the issue why is weapon breakage even a problem or a barrier for you? You just said you have more than enough weapons at any given time."

I'd say they do give you a ton of weapons, but you have to decide which ones are truly ones you want to keep.

It also doesn't make any sense to say you are given too many weapons AND it's a nuisance when they break. If the breaking is annoying because you lose a weapon, but you're given weapons..."

Zelda is similar, it incentivizes searching for stronger, more durable weapons.

And no, if you constantly head-on attack enemies you wont have a large selection of great weapons, you'll have a lot of boko clubs and boko spears.

Weapon durability also drives you to use weapons with varying utility. To avoid breaking good weapons you can do a myriad of other methods of fighting."

So you are telling me you do have plenty of equipment all the time, so how is that really any different from having unbreakable weapons? You're going in circles here.

If you manage them well you can play with only high level stuff, if you manage them poorly you'll be working mostly with basic weaponry.

Rare weapons are key. Elemental weapons as well. It's the design that if you want to keep having strong weapons you have to vary playstyle or you'll just have boko shit to work with.

Again, you don't have to learn up on game design, just recognize it. What you're arguing is item management isn't fun, but that's how survival games are built.

It's ok to admit when you are wrong. The system is incredibly well implemented here. Comparing to Dead Rising is pretty idiotic given that Dead Rising is an action game first and foremost, comparing to Minecraft makes sense because the two, while obviously different, share survival and exploration elements with each other. Similarly Dark Souls is also an action game first and foremost, so the comparison there is equally weak.

Resource management is key to survival games, and the weapon durability in Zelda is a sign of that. Without it the game would be fundamentally broken. As with any game, smart play is rewarded, in this case with a strong set of weapons.

You're showing more and more that you just don't like survival elements, and that's your opinion.

You clearly don't know what you're talking about, given that weapons are not ""constantly breaking"" in any sense of the word once you're more than a few hours into the game. Even midrange weaponry is durable enough to last an enemy camp or two. So as the game progresses, if you are constantly fighting enemies head on you likely will end up running out of rarer equipment, but if you're smart and minimize weapon damage you can get a full set of great weapons, otherwise you'll likely be working with weaker bokoblin weapons. The weapon breaking system is a great way to make direct attacks on all enemies a less desirable tactic than using the dozen other tactics in your repertoire. In fact, each tactic has it's downsides that force you to try out a variety of tactics in tandem. Stealth is the most rewarding, but also more slow and difficult to execute, archery is great but in close quarters becomes less effective, and many enemies block arrows, environmental attacks are the least resource intensive, but also require the most forethought and tacking a tactical approach. It's a great balance between the multiple systems at play, and a lack of weapon durability would completely botch that.

You really truly do not understand game design, but that's ok, you don't have to appreciate solid game design.

If you're fighting things far below you button mashing is viable, things at your equipment level and above, absolutely not. If you are in the middle of 3-4 enemies you will get annihilated. The game heavily emphasizes strategically attacking camps through environmental weapons, stealth to pick off the sentries, and then using tools like bombs to damage the heavier enemies before going in to finish them off.

Witcher 3 you can... cast Quen and then press light attack a bunch? Maybe dodge once in a while for good measure."
1683908811,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"That's not even remotely true due to dodging i-frames. Also Quen alone will usually do the trick, but one of Quen's first upgrades is a blast that knocks all enemies back when Quen is exhausted, just furthering the OP that is Quen. In Witcher I might get hit occasionally, but it hardly matters because 9 times out of 10 Quen is active anyways. 

Idk, maybe it's because I play a lot fo the Souls series, but Witcher is ungodly easy if you're any kind of decent at dodging. I've also found lock on is more of a detriment than a benefit during combat, I could see multiple enemies being tough if you tried to use the lockon in Witcher, but get rid of it and you can see and anticipate the enemies moves in your surroundings.

Sure you could wait it out, but there's always a way there that doesn't involve climbing. They encourage you to find new paths and try new things, and if you resist that I could definitely see it being annoying.

I do agree once you are strong enough there's less need for variety, but I think that's just how games in general work. I could see them fixing that with bonuses for stealthily clearing a camp, or something along those lines, but just by the nature of most games without ""score"" incentive, if you have good equipment you don't have to be that careful.

I'd argue at any point in the game you have to be smart and careful engaging things like silver Lynels though. That's just the games progression system; tough enemies require smart planning, easier enemies dont, and as you progress more and more enemies inevitably fall into the easier category.

In my experience, the challenge does subside a bit as you get used to your old stomping grounds, but you can usually find the challenge again if you look around just a little. Go to the far west and there are long stretches of like 3+ lynels to fight if you're bold."
1683908816,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Exactly! That's one thing I've loved about Dark Souls; you can find interesting weapons but they never feel that OP.

Zelda approaches that in a different, interesting route. You can get OP weapons, but you can't rely on them. You can make things briefly easier but you'll have to keep scavenging weapons if you want to keep it up."
1683908816,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Well yes ""git gud"" is always an option lol, but if you're just good enough then I agree it doesn't really require too much planning.

Idk man, it seems like you give up. Lots of times when it's raining I find a better vantage point and hangglide to my previous goal. If not, I explore one of the other bajillion things right in my vicinity. That's the beauty I think, maybe you can't get that korok on the mountain right now, but just turn around and you'll find another thing to do, and by the time you finish you can probably go get that korok.

The game does discourage certain actions at certain times, but it feels to me like a way of getting you to be more observant and aware of your surroundings, and sometimes that means exploring something entirely different for a bit.

Worst comes to worst, make a campfire and wait til morning to get through the rain. It's only your own creativity that limits what you can do. Sometimes i have felt that ""the games dangling this in my face"" feeling, but I almost always find a solution."

Without the rain I would've just climbed it normally. It's faster and easier, but it's not more fun and it's far less interesting.

Dead Rising is much more of an action game from what I've seen, so it makes sense that weapons last longer, especially when using weapons is really your only main method of fighting.

Zelda tries to encourage players to find different methods of attack, they even have hints and tips on other ways to avoid direct attacks with weapons.

On top of that, high level weapons are extremely durable, it's only really early game that you'll be constantly losing weapons."

If you just think the whole idea of combat is trivial of course you find the weapon system trivial lol. Can you honestly not see how having a Guardian Battleaxe ++ that is unbreakable would just fuck the game? I could maybe respect a repair system, but unless they want to restrict the loot you can get from the beginning, permanent weapons just wouldn't fly.

One thing I thought they should have is an easy mode for players who don't want to deal with breaking equipment. I think that would be an extremely easy game, but some people don't want to deal with the weapon stuff."

I agree the game is fairly easy, but I think that's why weapon durability is important. It adds an element of item management that keeps me engaged even when the combat encounters get less difficult. I know I need some weapons that can hit lightning without shocking me, some ranged weapons, stuff like that, because even with the ease of combat there are some encounters you just can't go in and tank."
1683908969,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"But the game is in some parts trying to have survival elements to it, and item management is integral to survival game. Some people may dislike it but it wouldn't be much of a survival game with unlimited high power weaponry.

Take Minecraft for example: weapons and tools are often easy to break. This adds a layer of depth to the game, because you constantly have to find or craft equipment to survive. Similarly with Zelda you have to keep finding equipment. I think one way they could make this better would be enemy encounters that you can't just run away from, and some which are just sprung on you, sort of like the Khoga tribe enemies."

So if having too many weapons is the issue why is weapon breakage even a problem or a barrier for you? You just said you have more than enough weapons at any given time."
1683908972,102.0.0.10,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"I mean you're basically calling the survival genre busy work, which is fine, but you have to recognize it develops unique gameplay scenarios and encourages different approaches.

I'd say they do give you a ton of weapons, but you have to decide which ones are truly ones you want to keep.

It also doesn't make any sense to say you are given too many weapons AND it's a nuisance when they break. If the breaking is annoying because you lose a weapon, but you're given weapons..."

Zelda is similar, it incentivizes searching for stronger, more durable weapons.

And no, if you constantly head-on attack enemies you wont have a large selection of great weapons, you'll have a lot of boko clubs and boko spears.

Weapon durability also drives you to use weapons with varying utility. To avoid breaking good weapons you can do a myriad of other methods of fighting."

So you are telling me you do have plenty of equipment all the time, so how is that really any different from having unbreakable weapons? You're going in circles here.

If you manage them well you can play with only high level stuff, if you manage them poorly you'll be working mostly with basic weaponry.

Rare weapons are key. Elemental weapons as well. It's the design that if you want to keep having strong weapons you have to vary playstyle or you'll just have boko shit to work with.

Again, you don't have to learn up on game design, just recognize it. What you're arguing is item management isn't fun, but that's how survival games are built.

And yes, even in survival games you have to choose what stays and what goes. Play Resident Evil 4 and notice the limited storage."

It makes it so weapons almost become a resource, and one you don't want to expend. For instance, in horror survival games you typically conserve bullets right? Well here you conserve your weapons, and it drives you to find unique and resourceful solutions to combat instead of diving in head first and breaking most of your stuff."

It's ok to admit when you are wrong. The system is incredibly well implemented here. Comparing to Dead Rising is pretty idiotic given that Dead Rising is an action game first and foremost, comparing to Minecraft makes sense because the two, while obviously different, share survival and exploration elements with each other. Similarly Dark Souls is also an action game first and foremost, so the comparison there is equally weak.

Resource management is key to survival games, and the weapon durability in Zelda is a sign of that. Without it the game would be fundamentally broken. As with any game, smart play is rewarded, in this case with a strong set of weapons.

You're showing more and more that you just don't like survival elements, and that's your opinion.

You clearly don't know what you're talking about, given that weapons are not ""constantly breaking"" in any sense of the word once you're more than a few hours into the game. Even midrange weaponry is durable enough to last an enemy camp or two. So as the game progresses, if you are constantly fighting enemies head on you likely will end up running out of rarer equipment, but if you're smart and minimize weapon damage you can get a full set of great weapons, otherwise you'll likely be working with weaker bokoblin weapons. The weapon breaking system is a great way to make direct attacks on all enemies a less desirable tactic than using the dozen other tactics in your repertoire. In fact, each tactic has it's downsides that force you to try out a variety of tactics in tandem. Stealth is the most rewarding, but also more slow and difficult to execute, archery is great but in close quarters becomes less effective, and many enemies block arrows, environmental attacks are the least resource intensive, but also require the most forethought and tacking a tactical approach. It's a great balance between the multiple systems at play, and a lack of weapon durability would completely botch that.

You really truly do not understand game design, but that's ok, you don't have to appreciate solid game design.

All you need is to look into game design a little bit, it would make things a lot clearer for you.

Yes, you've made a few contradictions, arguments like you feel like you can't use your best weapons even though you go on to say you constantly have enough. Really just a poor grasp of game design."
