1683848502,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,Everyone seems so bitter in this thread... what's happening?
1683848503,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"I saw that... Which prompted me to make this comment, among others. 

Why is everyone in such a sour mood? :/"
1683848503,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"The whole new costume dynamic is being introduced!

The game might be multiplayer centric, but that doesn't mean it still won't have a kick ass single-player experience! This is definitely not a half-assed game! This is a whole-new Zelda adventure. I wouldn't worry about it."

1683848504,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"I was asking for it. In fact, I knew a lot people asking for another multi-player Zelda game! 

First of all, 3DS is the most wirelessly connective device Nintendo has ever made. They made two multi-zeldas that required cables for christ's sake, now that they've created this wireless juggernaut, why woulnd't they release a new Zelda game?!  You're totally wrong on all three of your points...  I don't usually play 3DS on the go, I play it in my home, on the couch or something while the TV's on. I know a lot of other people who do this too, including practically ALL of Japan.

 How do you know that you wont be able to communicate with other people? Have you played the game yet? The online aspects of this game are enormous! You might even meet new people online! Who knows?!?!

Also the levels probably won't be too long because of the online commitment, which might be a gripe, but it's only speculation at this point...

They said they were going to have a single-player experience worthwhile, and I trust them...

Don't sulk, be happy! We're getting another Zelda game that no one expected. We weren't even sure we were going to get anything at this year's E3 for Zelda, and we needed up getting a whole new game! It's a bonus! Be grateful!"

1683848504,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"It'll probably be treated like the FS games in that, they're main series spin-offs lol"

1683848504,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"1. it is a new game

2. you have no idea what you;re talking about apparently because experimenting is what Nintendo (and Zelda for that matter) is all about

3. It's not a mini-game

4. Why can't people wrap their head around the fact that it's a new, bonus Zelda game!?"
1683848505,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,What if I told you it was a different development teams?

I'm extremely excited by this announcement! Everyone is so ungrateful! We weren't expecting ANY new Zelda content this E3, instead we got a completely new Zelda adventure! People need to get their heads out their asses and realize that we're getting 2 new Zelda games in 2 years and stop being so pissy"
1683848507,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"But Triforce Heroes *is* an exciting new project! I don't know... Besides, this r/Zelda, we're here to talk about the new ZELDA announcements at E3, not the other stuff that may have dissapointed people."
1683848507,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"I don't think Triforce Heroes will be a party game. I wouldn't worry about that! I'm sorry about the other games, though:/ Not being a big Metroid or Animal Crossing fan (not that I dont like them, just that I haven't played them) I guess this whole conference was overshadowed by the new Zelda announcement for me"
1683848507,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"Yeah, you're being a bitter asshole, and *I'm* the one with no brain...

*Uncharted (already announced, got gameplay for it)

*Halo (already announced, got gameplay for it)

*Battlefront (already announced, got gameplay for it)

Out of the 5 games mentioned, 1 is a remake and 3 were alreaedy announced!!

Nintendo reveals a new Paper Mario/Mario and Luigi Cross Over, gives us a ton of gameplay for starfox, Xenoblade X trailer, a couple of other new games, what the fuck are you looking for?! Just cause you don't like the new games announced, doesn't mean they didn't announce new games. Youre a selfish, childish, shit-brain of a fan who lacks reference... It's embarrassing...

"
1683848508,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"I understand, i'm saying instead of being so negative about the new announcement (at least for Zelda) try to be positive! Let yourself believe that Nintendo will pull this off! They've never let us down with Zelda yet!"
1683848509,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"It seems that we both agree. I think people need to realize that this a bonus game we're getting while we wait for Zelda Wii U. We weren't expecting anything new but we got this and i think people should be a little more grateful for this announcement. And i really try to stray from using the term ""spin-off"" cause even spin-offs in Zelda are treated like main games."
1683848509,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"It's also easy to forget that Nintendo has an entirely different demographic piled on on top of us, and that they need to cater to that demo too!"
1683848510,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"Jesus Christ.... this comment hurt me. you're lack of understanding for what you're talking about physically hurts me. Okay, where should we start?!

3DS Mario RPG games. I know a lot of people who actually really enjoy them and look forward to getting the next one when they're announced! So, they're pretty happy about aht announcement.

Your love for Super Mario RPG 2 tells me you had a Super Nintendo growing up and that you're one of those nostalgic asshat gamers who hate Nintendo because they've changed since you were a kid in the 90's. 

Then, you go on to talk about Xenoblade X. Don't like a game? Insult it's audience! That's the intelligent and level headed thing to do!:D Something tells me  you probably still need more growing up there, sport!

What would you call Mario Maker then? Is it a mario game? Yes. Is it on console? Yes. So..... console mario game... cool.

Nintendo told us *eons* ago that they weren't gonna show any Wii U Zelda game footage because they delayed the game. The fact that you were not aware of this, doesn't mean they fucked up. That   means you were ill informed (a trend I'm beginning to really pick up here) Everyone knew except you apparently.

HAHAHAHA Steaming hot dump! THAT'S SO FUNNY. You sound like a 5th grader learning how to use dirty words in a sentence! Keep practicing, buddy:) As for the Metroid thing, i can see why some people would be disappointed, as it's a spin-off and not a true Metroid game. Looks pretty cool, but I can understand your disappointment.

""The graphics aren't good!!!!!!!!!"" is literally the stupidest excuse for disliking a game I've ever sen. WHO THE FUCK CARES THAT IT LOOKS LIKE GCN GRAPHICS?! Is it gonna be fun, you don't know yet. Does it look like it keeps in spirit with the star fox series? Yes. But you're such a shallow moron, all you care about is the graphics...

Sony was very lackluster in their conference, are you kidding?! They gave us Uncharted and................. uhhhhhhh Last Guardian? 3 years too late? A remake of a 10 year old game? No Man's Sky looked cool. Dreams was just a tiny teaser with no release date and we got 5 minutes of Uncharted gameplay. What E3 have you been watching?!

Microsoft did a lot better. The backwards compatibility was a great feature to add and mod support for Fallout 4 was cool too. But we didn't ""get **Motherfucking Fallout 4 and Doom**. Fallout 4 was announced two weeks ago. We got gameplay footage. WHICH IS WHAT NINTENDO GAVE US. Same with Doom.

Safe to say, you have no clue what you're talking about, you have the mindset of a 3rd grader and there really isn't any talking to you because your skull is too thick for any information to pass through it to your incredibly tiny brain."
1683848510,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"We weren't expecting ANYTHING new for Zelda. We get something new and everyone throws a hissy fit! I don't get it... we weren't even expecting this. This was a total surprise. It's not like they said ""Hey guys, new Zelda 3DS game this E3"" they just came out and gave it to us... That's pretty awesome. People need to stop complaining about a BONUS Zelda game..."
1683848510,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"Those are very good counters to all my points! I'm so glad you realized I'm right:) I'm not even defending Nintendo, I'm countering your incredibly shitty points! Out of all of those series the only one I even care about is Zelda, that's it. I couldn't care less about anything else, youre just so bad at not sounding like a whiny prick that I couldn't resist!"
1683848511,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"What? They can't create spin-offs using popular IPs? And you say ""approaching"" so we're not there yet. You *really* think Nintendo isn't working on something for the 30th. Have a little more faith than that!"
1683848511,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"(well that is one of their demographics:/)

1683848517,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,Go back and watch A Link Between Worlds' reveal trailer. Then think about how awesome that game was...
1683848517,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"Okay

1. How do you know it doesn't have a full story? Watch ALBW reveal trailer and tell me if you thought it had any story then

2. Zelda is ALL ABOUT GIMICKS! Have you ever even played a Zelda game?

The clothing system in general is a very cool concept! Think about. Spending time unlocking an outfit with a certain perk to it, then replaying levels with that perk. It makes for a different experience every time you play, I think that's really cool!"

1683849623,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"It'll probably be treated like the FS games in that, they're main series spin-offs lol"
1683849623,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,I almost cried!!!!
1683849623,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,Online!!!!
1683849623,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"1. it is a new game

2. you have no idea what you;re talking about apparently because experimenting is what Nintendo (and Zelda for that matter) is all about

3. It's not a mini-game

4. Why can't people wrap their head around the fact that it's a new, bonus Zelda game!?"
1683849624,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,What if I told you it was a different development teams?
1683849625,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"Wait, are you kidding? It's the same art style as ALBW...."
1683849625,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"You're right, Majora's Mask sucked /s"
1683849625,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,Well I'm just going by past Zelda experiences...
1683849625,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"Except I know a lot of people who do... *You* might, but don't lump your sorry ass into the rest of us. I'm extremely excited by this announcement! Everyone is so ungrateful! We weren't expecting ANY new Zelda content this E3, instead we got a completely new Zelda adventure! People need to get their heads out their asses and realize that we're getting 2 new Zelda games in 2 years and stop being so pissy"
1683849625,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"But Triforce Heroes *is* an exciting new project! I don't know... Besides, this r/Zelda, we're here to talk about the new ZELDA announcements at E3, not the other stuff that may have dissapointed people."
1683849626,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"I don't think Triforce Heroes will be a party game. I wouldn't worry about that! I'm sorry about the other games, though:/ Not being a big Metroid or Animal Crossing fan (not that I dont like them, just that I haven't played them) I guess this whole conference was overshadowed by the new Zelda announcement for me"
1683849626,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"Yeah, you're being a bitter asshole, and *I'm* the one with no brain...

*Uncharted (already announced, got gameplay for it)

*Halo (already announced, got gameplay for it)

*Battlefront (already announced, got gameplay for it)

Out of the 5 games mentioned, 1 is a remake and 3 were alreaedy announced!!

Nintendo reveals a new Paper Mario/Mario and Luigi Cross Over, gives us a ton of gameplay for starfox, Xenoblade X trailer, a couple of other new games, what the fuck are you looking for?! Just cause you don't like the new games announced, doesn't mean they didn't announce new games. Youre a selfish, childish, shit-brain of a fan who lacks reference... It's embarrassing...

"
1683849626,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"I understand, i'm saying instead of being so negative about the new announcement (at least for Zelda) try to be positive! Let yourself believe that Nintendo will pull this off! They've never let us down with Zelda yet!"
1683849627,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"It seems that we both agree. I think people need to realize that this a bonus game we're getting while we wait for Zelda Wii U. We weren't expecting anything new but we got this and i think people should be a little more grateful for this announcement. And i really try to stray from using the term ""spin-off"" cause even spin-offs in Zelda are treated like main games."
1683849627,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"It's also easy to forget that Nintendo has an entirely different demographic piled on on top of us, and that they need to cater to that demo too!"
1683849629,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"Jesus Christ.... this comment hurt me. you're lack of understanding for what you're talking about physically hurts me. Okay, where should we start?!

3DS Mario RPG games. I know a lot of people who actually really enjoy them and look forward to getting the next one when they're announced! So, they're pretty happy about aht announcement.

Your love for Super Mario RPG 2 tells me you had a Super Nintendo growing up and that you're one of those nostalgic asshat gamers who hate Nintendo because they've changed since you were a kid in the 90's. 

Then, you go on to talk about Xenoblade X. Don't like a game? Insult it's audience! That's the intelligent and level headed thing to do!:D Something tells me  you probably still need more growing up there, sport!

What would you call Mario Maker then? Is it a mario game? Yes. Is it on console? Yes. So..... console mario game... cool.

Nintendo told us *eons* ago that they weren't gonna show any Wii U Zelda game footage because they delayed the game. The fact that you were not aware of this, doesn't mean they fucked up. That   means you were ill informed (a trend I'm beginning to really pick up here) Everyone knew except you apparently.

HAHAHAHA Steaming hot dump! THAT'S SO FUNNY. You sound like a 5th grader learning how to use dirty words in a sentence! Keep practicing, buddy:) As for the Metroid thing, i can see why some people would be disappointed, as it's a spin-off and not a true Metroid game. Looks pretty cool, but I can understand your disappointment.

""The graphics aren't good!!!!!!!!!"" is literally the stupidest excuse for disliking a game I've ever sen. WHO THE FUCK CARES THAT IT LOOKS LIKE GCN GRAPHICS?! Is it gonna be fun, you don't know yet. Does it look like it keeps in spirit with the star fox series? Yes. But you're such a shallow moron, all you care about is the graphics...

Sony was very lackluster in their conference, are you kidding?! They gave us Uncharted and................. uhhhhhhh Last Guardian? 3 years too late? A remake of a 10 year old game? No Man's Sky looked cool. Dreams was just a tiny teaser with no release date and we got 5 minutes of Uncharted gameplay. What E3 have you been watching?!

Microsoft did a lot better. The backwards compatibility was a great feature to add and mod support for Fallout 4 was cool too. But we didn't ""get **Motherfucking Fallout 4 and Doom**. Fallout 4 was announced two weeks ago. We got gameplay footage. WHICH IS WHAT NINTENDO GAVE US. Same with Doom.

Safe to say, you have no clue what you're talking about, you have the mindset of a 3rd grader and there really isn't any talking to you because your skull is too thick for any information to pass through it to your incredibly tiny brain."
1683849629,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"We weren't expecting ANYTHING new for Zelda. We get something new and everyone throws a hissy fit! I don't get it... we weren't even expecting this. This was a total surprise. It's not like they said ""Hey guys, new Zelda 3DS game this E3"" they just came out and gave it to us... That's pretty awesome. People need to stop complaining about a BONUS Zelda game..."
1683849629,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"Those are very good counters to all my points! I'm so glad you realized I'm right:) I'm not even defending Nintendo, I'm countering your incredibly shitty points! Out of all of those series the only one I even care about is Zelda, that's it. I couldn't care less about anything else, youre just so bad at not sounding like a whiny prick that I couldn't resist!"
1683849629,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"What? They can't create spin-offs using popular IPs? And you say ""approaching"" so we're not there yet. You *really* think Nintendo isn't working on something for the 30th. Have a little more faith than that!"
1683849630,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"(well that is one of their demographics:/)

And what makes you think next years E3 wont have new metroid for the holiday season?"
1683849635,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,Seriously! These people are ridiculous!  They get a brand new Zelda game and all they do is whine and bitch...
1683849635,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,I'm with you on that...
1683849635,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,Go back and watch A Link Between Worlds' reveal trailer. Then think about how awesome that game was...
1683849636,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"Okay

1. How do you know it doesn't have a full story? Watch ALBW reveal trailer and tell me if you thought it had any story then

2. Zelda is ALL ABOUT GIMICKS! Have you ever even played a Zelda game?

1683849638,102.0.0.45,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource7.html,"May have overreacted. But my pet peeve with Zelda fans is the want for remakes. You should ALWAYS want new original content. You have to be crazy not to, even if it's multiplayer you don't know how it'll play single player!"

The clothing system in general is a very cool concept! Think about. Spending time unlocking an outfit with a certain perk to it, then replaying levels with that perk. It makes for a different experience every time you play, I think that's really cool!"

2. You're right, touch screen controls were totally necessary for Phantom Hourglass's story! Fashion consciousness plays in line with the new mechanic, so you backed yourself into a corner there. It will be canon. Just like four swords and FSA.

3. There is no such thing as serious Zelda. Anyone who thinks so is delusional."
