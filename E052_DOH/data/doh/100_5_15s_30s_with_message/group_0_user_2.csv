If you've played the game with even a scrap of imagination, you'd see how much the game encourages varied playstyles. You don't like your weapons breaking? Find a way to sneak up on enemies and deal a ton of damage without using your weapons. Drop a metal block on their heads. Roll bombs down a hill until they're dead. Use an elixir and sneak up on them and kill them in their sleep. There's so many ways that BotW encourages players to be imaginative. 

This man is playing to find the flaws in this game rather than playing to find the joy in it. Why? Because a 7/10 on a game like grabs more attention than a 9/10.

1683848375,102.0.0.12,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"While I disagree with the weapon complaint, I do understand it. My theory is that I always  have more weapons than I need. Any time I come to a chest I think ""well shit, what am I gonna throw away this time?"" so eventually I decided to just use the weapons I have, even if they're super strong and rare. If they break, oh well. I can always get new weapons. And after fighting a monster camp, I always come out with more weapons than I started with. 

And I also understand the stamina complaint although I don't find the wheel to be ugly or it to be excruciatingly slow while not sprinting (and the game gives you several different modes of transportation other than jogging). There are food and elixir to replenish stamina when you're low and after you do a few upgrades, you really don't need them anymore. So I don't think it's detrimental to the gameplay.

The standard bokoblins and moblins are kind of boring to fight, but lizalfos aren't, wizrobes aren't, and any of the larger enemies aren't, like Lynels and mini bosses. And they do do more damage, but that's because they have better weapons and they are encouraging you to dodge or block their attacks, which the game teaches you about pretty much day 1. 

The biggest complaint that I have is that it's so hard to avoid the rain. If it's raining and you can't find an overhang to make a campfire at, you really are SoL. I was climbing some mountains the other day and it started raining and I just had to wait it out because I really couldn't progress any further without climbing, and I had gone so far that I didn't want to turn back.

1683848375,102.0.0.12,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Yep. Weapons breaking isn't a big deal at all. If a weapon breaks, that means you're fighting an enemy. You know who has weapons that you can take? Enemies. And it takes 0 time at all there's a quick selection right on the D-pad for new weapons, shields, bows, and arrows. They don't even make you go into the pause screen. 

You don't even need to go into a shrine to have it be useful. Once you scan your slate on it, it shows up as a teleport point and shows up on the map. You don't get the spirit orb until you complete it, but even on the map you can tell if it's a shrine you've completed or merely scanned.

But after playing for over a week now, I can confidently say that this is the best game that I've ever played. I like Zelda games but they're not the end all of video games IMO.

The great fairies do take a while and it is annoying. I do wish there was a more streamlined process for them. 

Cooking isn't perfect but I don't have a huge problem with it. I wish it had an option to cook while looking at the pot, and didn't require you to pause and go into your inventory on your own, but whatever. And cooking 1 dish at a time is really the only way that cooking could work. How can you specify ""I want 5 apples cooked individually"" rather than ""I want 5 apples cooked all together in one dish"" without cooking everything one at a time? It only takes a few minutes to cook a good amount of food so I don't think it's that big of a deal. 

Weapons breaking is only annoying for a moment because you have to pause your attack. Running out of weapons is never a real problem, even early on. There's always the next guys weapon for you to pick up, and no weapon is one of a kind. Everything resets after a blood moon (except for shrines). 

The menu isn't perfect and I do fumble with the controls a bit. I've noticed other people saying the same thing, although I don't think that the multiple pages is any worse than scrolling up or down. I think it's easier to lose track of what you have if everything is on one long page.
