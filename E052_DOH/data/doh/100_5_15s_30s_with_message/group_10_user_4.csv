I'm not sure I can take that as anything other than an easter egg. I'd have to see a reference to them in the original release of TP for that to convince me of their existence in that timeline.

Beyond what I mentioned earlier, you've also got a living Deku Tree (Ocarina - WW), the ancient sea mentioned in an item description (Ocarina - WW),  the location of the master sword (Link to the past), Zelda's referencing of TP. That sounds to me like all of these stories exist in some form in BotW's extremely distant past.

So it's irrelevant when I use it

&gt;The Master Sword is buried underwater

but relevant when you do? If you're going to use this as a disqualification, you must also apply the same logic to TP since the master sword is returned to the Sacred Grove near the Temple of Time, and there is no location for the master sword near the ruins of the temple of time in BotW.




&gt;But beyond any of this. BOTW CAN'T be in Wind Waker's timeline. The Master Sword is buried underwater, and they leave Hyrule.

There's nothing to say that the sea didn't recede, and that they didn't come back to Hyrule, is there? 

&gt;the Rito thing... why would that be an easter egg? They ACTIVELY added Rito to the game in the form of carvings, why would they do that?

Why wouldn't it be an easter egg? There's nothing to say it has any more significance than that, is there?

If you're gonna take the stance ""Maybe its all coincidental"" to all of my points, I think this conversation has run its course.
