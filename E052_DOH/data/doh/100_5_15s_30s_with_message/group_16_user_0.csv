1683848692,102.0.0.90,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource16.html,"I had a big long drawn out post for this but I guess I need to save it for my Youtube video I plan on starting and booting up a channel soon but here are some main points I want to bring up: 

There are two central themes that continue throughout EVERY. SINGLE. MECHANIC. in Breath of the Wild and those are: 

1. Adaptability
2. Exploration

You can argue a lot of things but those two themes motivated the mechanics in the game almost entirely. One might even call it a survival game due to this. The two biggest complaints I keep seeing are stamina wheel and weapon durabilities and neither of them make sense. Let's start with Stamina since that's an easy one to get over. 

Stamina starts out small, resulting in you as a player having to critically think about how you're going to use the limited resources given to you, much like Shadow of the Colossus. You're going to have to use that stamina you've got and find ledges and look and EXPLORE to find where you need to go. A million things can happen between now and the top of that cliff, thus promoting the adaptability. It could start raining, you could run into an enemy encounter, you could find that the top of the mountain has a temperature drop. All of these things are part of the ongoing themes of exploring the game world and adapting to what it gives you. 

A lot of shit talking I see about the stamina system ignores two MAJOR things in the game and I'm not sure why. Maybe they just didn't play the game beyond the tutorial level or maybe they just didn't care to do what the game tells you and experiment but cooking in this game is the great equalizer. 

Not one thing can not be handled by food, as taught in the beginning of the game in the tutorial where the player either A.) makes cold resistant food or B.) Makes food to get the warm doublet from the old man, helping to explain that there are multiple ways to fight the elements in the game. 

Ignoring EVEN THAT you can eat MID CLIMB, thus making the stamina wheel something that is only limited if you yourself are not planning (or adapting even) to the climb.

So the stamina wheel to me feels like a moot point because even a gajillion hours into the game with a ton of upgrades I never felt like anything was out of reach at the beginning, just that I am stronger now as a player to know where to go and have the stamina to do so. So as Link grows in strength in the game, I too have grown as a player by learning how better to handle the cliffs and mechanics the game has given to me via food, boosting items, etc. 

Onto Durability. 

Ignoring that a majority of the people I see complaining about it either haven't played the game or only talk about sticks and stuff, I've seen a few comments on here that have made me look at a few things. I think some people are just plain not thinking out their encounters. I think you're just going in, swords blazing, hitting shit with shields and then wondering why your stuff breaks. Or you're just ignoring the weapon mechanics completely. 

I haven't run out of weapons completely since the tutorial. I haven't upgraded my shield inventory at ALL in the game because I've yet to have an issue where I needed more than 4 at a time on my person. I've upgraded my melee weapons almost solely so I can keep things like Sledgehammers and axes around for utility and have the same few bows that I originally only had from Hyrule Castle that now spawn on a lot of enemies due to fighting things at my level and/or the natural enemy progression built into the game's design. 

I have never once had to ""avoid combat"" and to think the game encourages you to do so is absurd. Not only that but you do not have to use the item menu due to the dpad menu being a time stopper (I actually thought I'd hate this menu but it makes perfect sense as more time is spent with the game, another thing that I don't get people complaining about). 

The game does more than enough to give you everything you need to adapt to any battle. You can create ice at a whim, you can make infinite bombs, you can strike from above, you can use weather to your advantage, you can use metal to your advantage. All of these things allow you to adapt. If the weapons were unbreakable and powerful you'd just run in fight and leave. There's nothing the game is doing in that scenario that is teaching you or making you think about anything going on. It's just more of the same. 

Hell I got my shit wrecked more by a whole skull full of moblins on a cliff to the southeast than a Guardian  because my cocky ass thought that ""oh I have powerful weapons I can just walk up and faceroll them now"" Nope. Arrows in my face and swords in my gut. 

There's so many ways to go into combat that to list them all will make this already lengthy post even worse to read. You can upgrade your armor, you can make food to buff your defense or give you attack, you can use your elemental arrows to turn the fight in your favor. 

If avatar strength is what you're looking for (i.e. irrelevant numbers that correspond with how good or bad you are at fighting something) then yeah this isn't your game. You're meant to play smarter, not be given the illusion of progress with ""rpg elements"" that are just points you get to put into things like ""do more damage by doing the same thing you do every fight"" like a majority of games. 

That's not to say I don't enjoy rpgs and stuff, and turn based rpgs are some of my favorites and they fall into the numbers trope easily, but that's not what this game is about. It's about you adapting to your environment as you explore it and tackling what challenges are presented to you using the multiple mechanics and chemistry system within it. RPG elements from other games have given them a fake sense of progression that is all numbers based and not actually skill based, you're not actually getting stronger the game is just letting you do more damage (if you need another example of this see: Egoraptors Castlevania sequelitis for a more thorough example) 

Hell on the subject of ""Well I found this weapon and I don't know if I can find it again."" I have to just face palm because the game gives you 100 stamps and 5 pins for simply that purpose. The whole game is you being the cartographer and mapping out where you want to go what you find and how you want to do it. My game is littered with symbols and stamps on where good mineral deposits are, where chests I didn't have room for weapons are, where I found a neat shield, etc, all with the mechanics the game provides to you. 

The whole point is NOT getting attached to a weapon in the game, and I'll never understand how/why/when that became a ""mechanic"" or ""progression"" tactic in the first place. In fallout 4 if I mod a gun to do ridiculous damage I literally never need to worry about another gun in the game. That's not progression, that's just me putting big numbers on a projectile and making a majority of the game irrelevant as a result. 

So while I can get why people would not enjoy not having upgrades and ""rpg elements"" as they're so often called the game is not punishing you for not having those things, the game is balanced around those things not being a source of gameplay enjoyment and/or fun. So they are not a detriment to the game itself because it was designed with those questions in mind.

Again, this is all ignoring that the entire game is based around giving you tools to tackle every situation and if your only way of tackling that situation is ""mash the Y button to swing weapon"" then yeah you're not going to enjoy this game at all. That's not why this game is here. 

tl;dr the game is built around adapting to your environment as you survive, the game gives you all the mechanics you need to adapt to any scenario and deal with any shortcomings (including stamina) and the game isn't meant to be aimed at delivering Avatar Strength, but player agency and growth in the game systems.

1683848692,102.0.0.90,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource16.html,"Like I get it guys, but I can't express enough how awesome it is to think back on my progress as a player where I would be like sneaking around shit andi trying to do the most with a fucking stick and some bombs before and now I can plan out bomb traps, throw fire arrows, fuck up people's days and then beat them in the face with their own weapon. It's one of the most satisfying examples of player agency I've ever had in a game. 

As a player I can be happy that I know where to get sledgehammers, axes, swords, etc. As a player I can enjoy the fact that I've grown in learning how to tackle even toughest of scenarios (still fucking hate Lynels) without just upgrading the numbers I take off someone's health arbitrarily. As a player I enjoy knowing that if I go over that mountain over there I'll be ready to fight whatever's there because the game has already given me everything I needed to tackle it, and it's only my own mind that will limit me. I can explore to my hearts content and thanks to the game's steady progression I can adapt to whatever comes at me, and to pretend like a stamina wheel or durability limits you when the game isn't about doing the same thing you do in Dark Souls or Horizon is doing the designers a disservice to me.

As right out the gate in front of the tutorial level is a bunch of city ruins with tons of equipment all scattered through out and not difficult mobs defending them. 

I also notice the things you're asking for are the shoehorned in ""RPG"" elements that people continue to put into games to give the illusion of progress, i.e. bigger numbers = better player. You want more numbers based gameplay which this isn't about. PRimarily you also have food that can make up for shortcomings with weapons and things that you have less/weaker of. 

I'd also argue that weapons are the ONLY non permanent thing you get in the game, which balances out the core issue present in games like Dark Souls where you can literally shoot the tail off a dragon and faceroll most the game. "

Many of the things he talks about are circumvented by mechanics already in the game and/or taught to you but he decided to overlook that because of reasons, and/or if you'd believe some people is biased against Nintendo.

Whatever the reason myself and a lot of people have no issue with the 7/10 rating itself, even if it knocks it down a peg, but moreso the illogical and edgelord looking reasoning he took to denounce the game's mechanics while putting no emphasis on its benefits other than a few lines to quote back when people call him out for it as a manipulative defense. 

Saying ""but it's a good game"" doesn't mean anything if you spend most of it shitting on arbitrary mechanics that are not as deadlocked as someone makes them appear to be, but that's just my personal opinion, and I respect anyone with an opposing one.

It is fun game design but you have to play it to know, because it's NOT avatar based, it's player based. I think people have become too pampered by ""rpg elements"" being shoved into every game that unless you get something with moar numbers and moar coolness you can't progress in a game, which isn't the case. 

I would argue that Egoraptor's Sequelitis makes a really solid case for this, as the weapons and such in Castlevania 1 allow you to traverse obstacles in unique ways and have you plan out stuff, whereas C2 is more padding to make you buy things. One is ""rpg like"" grinding and one is as the player progresses. 

It's not that either is bad, it's just that we've catered and fostered a very avatar strength and numbers based progression system in modern day gaming and any departure from that (I feel) doesn't ""feel right"" to people used to just getting level ups and upgrade points and beating games. "

Except what you've just described is another type of grinding added into a game to elongate the player experience and pretend like you're doing better when you could feasibly use all 5 of those scimitars by the end of that process without going to farm for them. 

You're being punished for systems like the ones you describe more if not the same because instead of getting to just run around and play the game you are now having to:

1. Farm enemies and chests for the items you're looking for
2. Trek to specific locations to get weapons repaired 
3. take time you could be using to explore on your own and have your own adventure to strengthen a weapon that would ultimately become meaningless later on.

Like I get where you're coming from but the seamless transitions of exploration and gameplay/combat are the way they are to work against the type of gameplay you're describing, which is simply there to make you grind. 

One could argue the armor system in the game does simply this, and I would agree, but I'd also say that the increased armor being at the cost of grinding is the way the game keeps you from just facerolling the game, much like the durability system. "

While his complaints are valid from his own personal experience, saying ""I hate having to wait for rain"" without explaining the reason for it and/or not seeing why it's there is just as bad in my opinion. If you're going to trash something and not question why it exists than why even review things. 

I get what you're saying completely, but you're talking about breaking weapons against silver lynels, arguably the best enemies in the game and tougher than all the rest. If you're not breaking something I'd be worried. 

In no point in a game like this should you just be able to go ""okay I don't need anything else"" because it stifles the gameplay, but that's a different tangent. Jim can have all the opinions he wants, but when I read the written review it feels like he just played an hour of the game and whined about it rather than thought about why any of it existed in the game.

This is one of those other things that leads me to believe he thought he was playing a 3d platformer and didn't look at any of the mechanics the game teaches you. I got to the top of dueling peaks with three hearts and no stamina upgrades in the game. 

As reductive as it sounds and I'm sure everything I said before this will be thrown out for saying it, ""git gud"" is all I have to say to a guy who looks at a game that asks you to think about how to approach something and then whines because he can't just muscle his way through it. "

Saying ""it's not fun to me"" is super honest and cool, saying it ""sucks"" is where a lot of the conflict arises as people continue to confuse personal preferences with observations, with things like the review's hatred of the stamina wheel despite there being multiple mechanics built around overcoming said obstacles. 

I'm super stoked for hard mode to be honest. With how the difficulty was so far I'd be happy to get my ass handed to me by more Moblins. That being said I want more of this Hyrule and worry that Nintendo won't offer it.

The two biggest complaints I keep seeing are stamina wheel and weapon durabilities and neither of them make sense. Let's start with Stamina since that's an easy one to get over. 

Stamina starts out small, resulting in you as a player having to critically think about how you're going to use the limited resources given to you, much like Shadow of the Colossus. You're going to have to use that stamina you've got and find ledges and look and EXPLORE to find where you need to go.

It could start raining, you could run into an enemy encounter, you could find that the top of the mountain has a temperature drop. All of these things are part of the ongoing themes of exploring the game world and adapting to what it gives you. 

A lot of shit talking I see about the stamina system ignores two MAJOR things in the game and I'm not sure why. Maybe they just didn't play the game beyond the tutorial level or maybe they just didn't care to do what the game tells you and experiment but cooking in this game is the great equalizer. 

Not one thing can not be handled by food, as taught in the beginning of the game in the tutorial where the player either A.) makes cold resistant food or B.) Makes food to get the warm doublet from the old man, helping to explain that there are multiple ways to fight the elements in the game. 

Ignoring EVEN THAT you can eat MID CLIMB, thus making the stamina wheel something that is only limited if you yourself are not planning (or adapting even) to the climb.

So the stamina wheel to me feels like a moot point because even a gajillion hours into the game with a ton of upgrades I never felt like anything was out of reach at the beginning, just that I am stronger now as a player to know where to go and have the stamina to do so. So as Link grows in strength in the game, I too have grown as a player by learning how better to handle the cliffs and mechanics the game has given to me via food, boosting items, etc. 

Onto Durability. 

Ignoring that a majority of the people I see complaining about it either haven't played the game or only talk about sticks and stuff, I've seen a few comments on here that have made me look at a few things. I think some people are just plain not thinking out their encounters. I think you're just going in, swords blazing, hitting shit with shields and then wondering why your stuff breaks. Or you're just ignoring the weapon mechanics completely. 

I haven't run out of weapons completely since the tutorial. I haven't upgraded my shield inventory at ALL in the game because I've yet to have an issue where I needed more than 4 at a time on my person. I've upgraded my melee weapons almost solely so I can keep things like Sledgehammers and axes around for utility and have the same few bows that I originally only had from Hyrule Castle that now spawn on a lot of enemies due to fighting things at my level and/or the natural enemy progression built into the game's design. 

I have never once had to ""avoid combat"" and to think the game encourages you to do so is absurd. Not only that but you do not have to use the item menu due to the dpad menu being a time stopper (I actually thought I'd hate this menu but it makes perfect sense as more time is spent with the game, another thing that I don't get people complaining about). 

The game does more than enough to give you everything you need to adapt to any battle. You can create ice at a whim, you can make infinite bombs, you can strike from above, you can use weather to your advantage, you can use metal to your advantage. All of these things allow you to adapt. If the weapons were unbreakable and powerful you'd just run in fight and leave. There's nothing the game is doing in that scenario that is teaching you or making you think about anything going on. It's just more of the same. 

Hell I got my shit wrecked more by a whole skull full of moblins on a cliff to the southeast than a Guardian  because my cocky ass thought that ""oh I have powerful weapons I can just walk up and faceroll them now"" Nope. Arrows in my face and swords in my gut. 

There's so many ways to go into combat that to list them all will make this already lengthy post even worse to read. You can upgrade your armor, you can make food to buff your defense or give you attack, you can use your elemental arrows to turn the fight in your favor. 

If avatar strength is what you're looking for (i.e. irrelevant numbers that correspond with how good or bad you are at fighting something) then yeah this isn't your game. You're meant to play smarter, not be given the illusion of progress with ""rpg elements"" that are just points you get to put into things like ""do more damage by doing the same thing you do every fight"" like a majority of games. 

That's not to say I don't enjoy rpgs and stuff, and turn based rpgs are some of my favorites and they fall into the numbers trope easily, but that's not what this game is about. It's about you adapting to your environment as you explore it and tackling what challenges are presented to you using the multiple mechanics and chemistry system within it. RPG elements from other games have given them a fake sense of progression that is all numbers based and not actually skill based, you're not actually getting stronger the game is just letting you do more damage (if you need another example of this see: Egoraptors Castlevania sequelitis for a more thorough example) 

Hell on the subject of ""Well I found this weapon and I don't know if I can find it again."" I have to just face palm because the game gives you 100 stamps and 5 pins for simply that purpose. The whole game is you being the cartographer and mapping out where you want to go what you find and how you want to do it. My game is littered with symbols and stamps on where good mineral deposits are, where chests I didn't have room for weapons are, where I found a neat shield, etc, all with the mechanics the game provides to you. 

The whole point is NOT getting attached to a weapon in the game, and I'll never understand how/why/when that became a ""mechanic"" or ""progression"" tactic in the first place. In fallout 4 if I mod a gun to do ridiculous damage I literally never need to worry about another gun in the game. That's not progression, that's just me putting big numbers on a projectile and making a majority of the game irrelevant as a result. 

So while I can get why people would not enjoy not having upgrades and ""rpg elements"" as they're so often called the game is not punishing you for not having those things, the game is balanced around those things not being a source of gameplay enjoyment and/or fun. So they are not a detriment to the game itself because it was designed with those questions in mind.

Again, this is all ignoring that the entire game is based around giving you tools to tackle every situation and if your only way of tackling that situation is ""mash the Y button to swing weapon"" then yeah you're not going to enjoy this game at all. That's not why this game is here. 

tl;dr the game is built around adapting to your environment as you survive, the game gives you all the mechanics you need to adapt to any scenario and deal with any shortcomings (including stamina) and the game isn't meant to be aimed at delivering Avatar Strength, but player agency and growth in the game systems.

It's one of the most satisfying examples of player agency I've ever had in a game. 

As a player I can be happy that I know where to get sledgehammers, axes, swords, etc. As a player I can enjoy the fact that I've grown in learning how to tackle even toughest of scenarios (still fucking hate Lynels) without just upgrading the numbers I take off someone's health arbitrarily. As a player I enjoy knowing that if I go over that mountain over there I'll be ready to fight whatever's there because the game has already given me everything I needed to tackle it, and it's only my own mind that will limit me. I can explore to my hearts content and thanks to the game's steady progression I can adapt to whatever comes at me, and to pretend like a stamina wheel or durability limits you when the game isn't about doing the same thing you do in Dark Souls or Horizon is doing the designers a disservice to me.

I also notice the things you're asking for are the shoehorned in ""RPG"" elements that people continue to put into games to give the illusion of progress, i.e. bigger numbers = better player. You want more numbers based gameplay which this isn't about. PRimarily you also have food that can make up for shortcomings with weapons and things that you have less/weaker of. 

I'd also argue that weapons are the ONLY non permanent thing you get in the game, which balances out the core issue present in games like Dark Souls where you can literally shoot the tail off a dragon and faceroll most the game. "

Whatever the reason myself and a lot of people have no issue with the 7/10 rating itself, even if it knocks it down a peg, but moreso the illogical and edgelord looking reasoning he took to denounce the game's mechanics while putting no emphasis on its benefits other than a few lines to quote back when people call him out for it as a manipulative defense.

I would argue that Egoraptor's Sequelitis makes a really solid case for this, as the weapons and such in Castlevania 1 allow you to traverse obstacles in unique ways and have you plan out stuff, whereas C2 is more padding to make you buy things. One is ""rpg like"" grinding and one is as the player progresses. 

It's not that either is bad, it's just that we've catered and fostered a very avatar strength and numbers based progression system in modern day gaming and any departure from that (I feel) doesn't ""feel right"" to people used to just getting level ups and upgrade points and beating games. "

Except what you've just described is another type of grinding added into a game to elongate the player experience and pretend like you're doing better when you could feasibly use all 5 of those scimitars by the end of that process without going to farm for them. 

You're being punished for systems like the ones you describe more if not the same because instead of getting to just run around and play the game you are now having to:

1. Farm enemies and chests for the items you're looking for
2. Trek to specific locations to get weapons repaired 
3. take time you could be using to explore on your own and have your own adventure to strengthen a weapon that would ultimately become meaningless later on.

Like I get where you're coming from but the seamless transitions of exploration and gameplay/combat are the way they are to work against the type of gameplay you're describing, which is simply there to make you grind. 

One could argue the armor system in the game does simply this, and I would agree, but I'd also say that the increased armor being at the cost of grinding is the way the game keeps you from just facerolling the game, much like the durability system. "

If you're going to trash something and not question why it exists than why even review things. 

I get what you're saying completely, but you're talking about breaking weapons against silver lynels, arguably the best enemies in the game and tougher than all the rest. If you're not breaking something I'd be worried. 

In no point in a game like this should you just be able to go ""okay I don't need anything else"" because it stifles the gameplay, but that's a different tangent. Jim can have all the opinions he wants, but when I read the written review it feels like he just played an hour of the game and whined about it rather than thought about why any of it existed in the game.
