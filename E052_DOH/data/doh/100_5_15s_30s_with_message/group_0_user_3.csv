Just because I don't agree with him about this doesn't spoil my enjoyment of the game at all. It's flaws are very much present, it's not perfect, and I can see how some of them might be dealbreakers for some people.  Not me, personally, but my viewpoint is not the only one that matters. "

1683848422,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"I don't know, i feel like things have started to get a bit samey. Once you're powerful enough, a lot of the initial creativity the game forces you to use becomes less efficient than just charging in head first. I miss the time when doing that would get me killed.

I do also agree with his points about sometimes the game just doesn't want you to play it. Mostly the rain thing. Want to climb? You can't. Don't have revali's gale up? Tough shit. Want to wait it out? Oh wait you can't because you can't make a campfire because it's raining and to find shelter you'll have to backtrack truth everything you just did. 

I personally like the game more than he did, but that doesn't stop me from seeing his point. "
1683848424,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Yes but what if you want to get to the top of that mountain to reach one of the 900 korok seeds that might be up there? If the top of the mountain is your goal, then there often another way. It's restrictive, but it doesn't feel like it's in a way that forces me to be creative, it feels like it's just laughing in my face and stopping from doing one of the things the game supposedly wants the player to do. 

As for silver lynels... Parrys and perfect dodges into flurry rushes. Job's done. You don't really need to prepare for that, just execute it well. You might run out of weapons but by that point it's not likely."
1683848425,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,That's my point though - you can't make a campfire in the rain! 
1683848425,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"This is my point though, there often isn't shelter to be found. I know you said go explore elsewhere but that doesn't mean that the game isn't dictating my actions at that point. It's irritating and a waste of time while providing little interesting gameplay experience. 

I realise this is just one gripe and i do like the game a lot. I just wish it would let me explore it sometimes. The more i try to climb towards 100% completion the more i hate rain. "
1683848430,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"This happens quite frequently. I don't have much free gaming time. Being forced to wait 2 minutes is quite frustrating when I'd rather be exploring. This was way worse before i got revali's as well, as it was the last power i got. "
1683848430,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,Expand it how exactly?

My point is that it adds frustration without challenge, which you are treating as a problem that you're trying to help me with, where as i am treating it as a design flaw that i begrudgingly have to work around to play the game. I think these are incompatible view points. We don't agree, so there isn't much more to say. "
1683848431,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Look, I'm trying to say let's agree to disagree. Could you kindly accept that and stop trying to assign blame?"
1683848432,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"It's not my lack of understanding. It's not a case of me not understanding your point and if i just understood, I'd agree with you (which is how you're behaving). 

I actually don't think it's good design when a game punishes you for trying to play it. I have considered this and this is my viewpoint. You're not challenging my view of the design, asking ""why is this in the game?"", you're challenging my playstyle. Tell me what this feature adds to the experience. Tell me what about it adds to the experience such that it wouldn't be a better game without it."

There's no way to solve ""if I'm trying to climb this mountain the only way that didn't involve a 3 mile detour then i will continually slip down and make no progress"". There's no puzzle, no skill, no challenge to that, unless there is something I'm missing. That's just the game arbitrarily laughing at you while kicking you back down the mountain. It's not fun, it's not interesting. It takes you out of the flow of the game and slows you in a way that feels very forced. 

Again, prove me wrong. And don't just say ""think outside the box"" again because that's a non answer. The game's tools are literally not working for you in that situation. Unless you actually meant take that 3 mile detour in which case... Yeah that's still a design flaw. That's not enabling interesting gameplay that's forcibly changing your playstyle without good reason to. "
1683848458,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Once again, you make personal attacks rather than talk about the game design or try to grasp what I'm saying. It's not a fun or engaging challenge, it's a pain in the backside.

1683848459,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"And I'm asking where the puzzle is in that particular game mechanic. There's nothing to solve, you just have to wait or take a massive detour since it takes most of your tools away. I don't think that adds much to the game and it's a frustrating experience. 

And you did get personal with that last comment. Read that back and think about how that comes off. You've been implying I'm stupid throughout​this whole discussion as well which doesn't help. 

I did say agree to disagree but you don't want to even accept this is a valid criticism. "

1683848463,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"I don't know what game you're referencing. 

Yes you gave a list of solutions that situationally work and aren't always available, the gust power in particular you can't expect the player to have and there is often no shelter in the places this is a problem. There are plenty of situations where the player is forced back and it breaks the flow of play and causes frustration. Giving up and coming back later I particularly feel is a cop out of a solution. 

That in mind, i ask again, why is this feature here? I'd the gain in immersion (which i didn't particularly feel) worth the frustration of such an arbitrary obstacle? You don't seem to have an answer to this one, you just give a bunch of in game solutions where I'm trying to talk about the bigger picture. "
1683848465,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Not all of them are. The rain thing doesn't feel like a puzzle so much as a forced obstacle. 

Puzzles are intended that way, yes, but there's also a right way and time to introduce them and ""randomly because rain"" doesn't feel right, it feels forced. 

Sorry i didn't address every one of your points there, but i believe i made my position clear all the same. 

That said, you still haven't answered my question​. You haven't touched on it really at all, so I'm thinking you don't have an answer. That's fine, and you can say that you don't, that's ok. But since that's what I'm trying to understand from people who like this feature, I'm going to stop taking part in this discussion. 

I'd like to say it was productive but I'm not sure you actually listened to my point so much as found the easiest problem to solve and did that. 

Enjoy the game."
1683848467,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,And you still haven't answered why this is a good design choice. Still.
1683848468,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"It's great when these options are around, I agree, but you don't seem to appreciate that these options aren't always present. Sometimes you do just have no options. 

So would the rain not being an artificial obstacle to progress stop you from making a link catapult? So why is it there?"

Once you're powerful enough, a lot of the initial creativity the game forces you to use becomes less efficient than just charging in head first. I miss the time when doing that would get me killed.

I do also agree with his points about sometimes the game just doesn't want you to play it. Mostly the rain thing. Want to climb? You can't. Don't have revali's gale up? Tough shit. Want to wait it out? Oh wait you can't because you can't make a campfire because it's raining and to find shelter you'll have to backtrack truth everything you just did. 

I personally like the game more than he did, but that doesn't stop me from seeing his point. "

If the top of the mountain is your goal, then there often another way. It's restrictive, but it doesn't feel like it's in a way that forces me to be creative, it feels like it's just laughing in my face and stopping from doing one of the things the game supposedly wants the player to do. 

As for silver lynels... Parrys and perfect dodges into flurry rushes. Job's done. You don't really need to prepare for that, just execute it well. You might run out of weapons but by that point it's not likely."

I know you said go explore elsewhere but that doesn't mean that the game isn't dictating my actions at that point. It's irritating and a waste of time while providing little interesting gameplay experience. 

I realise this is just one gripe and i do like the game a lot. I just wish it would let me explore it sometimes. The more i try to climb towards 100% completion the more i hate rain. "

1683852394,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Look, I'm trying to say let's agree to disagree. Could you kindly accept that and stop trying to assign blame?"
1683852395,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"It's not my lack of understanding. It's not a case of me not understanding your point and if i just understood, I'd agree with you (which is how you're behaving). 

I actually don't think it's good design when a game punishes you for trying to play it. I have considered this and this is my viewpoint. You're not challenging my view of the design, asking ""why is this in the game?"", you're challenging my playstyle. Tell me what this feature adds to the experience. Tell me what about it adds to the experience such that it wouldn't be a better game without it."

There's no way to solve ""if I'm trying to climb this mountain the only way that didn't involve a 3 mile detour then i will continually slip down and make no progress"". There's no puzzle, no skill, no challenge to that, unless there is something I'm missing. That's just the game arbitrarily laughing at you while kicking you back down the mountain. It's not fun, it's not interesting. It takes you out of the flow of the game and slows you in a way that feels very forced. 

Again, prove me wrong. And don't just say ""think outside the box"" again because that's a non answer. The game's tools are literally not working for you in that situation. Unless you actually meant take that 3 mile detour in which case... Yeah that's still a design flaw. That's not enabling interesting gameplay that's forcibly changing your playstyle without good reason to. "

And you did get personal with that last comment. Read that back and think about how that comes off. You've been implying I'm stupid throughout​this whole discussion as well which doesn't help. 

I did say agree to disagree but you don't want to even accept this is a valid criticism. "
1683852426,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"I don't know what game you're referencing. 

Yes you gave a list of solutions that situationally work and aren't always available, the gust power in particular you can't expect the player to have and there is often no shelter in the places this is a problem. There are plenty of situations where the player is forced back and it breaks the flow of play and causes frustration. Giving up and coming back later I particularly feel is a cop out of a solution. 

That in mind, i ask again, why is this feature here? I'd the gain in immersion (which i didn't particularly feel) worth the frustration of such an arbitrary obstacle? You don't seem to have an answer to this one, you just give a bunch of in game solutions where I'm trying to talk about the bigger picture. "
1683852428,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Not all of them are. The rain thing doesn't feel like a puzzle so much as a forced obstacle. 

Puzzles are intended that way, yes, but there's also a right way and time to introduce them and ""randomly because rain"" doesn't feel right, it feels forced. 

Sorry i didn't address every one of your points there, but i believe i made my position clear all the same. 

That said, you still haven't answered my question​. You haven't touched on it really at all, so I'm thinking you don't have an answer. That's fine, and you can say that you don't, that's ok. But since that's what I'm trying to understand from people who like this feature, I'm going to stop taking part in this discussion. 

I'd like to say it was productive but I'm not sure you actually listened to my point so much as found the easiest problem to solve and did that. 

Enjoy the game."
1683852430,102.0.0.13,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,And you still haven't answered why this is a good design choice. Still.

So would the rain not being an artificial obstacle to progress stop you from making a link catapult? So why is it there?"
