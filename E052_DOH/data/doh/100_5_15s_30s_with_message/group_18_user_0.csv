Especially since they didn't even keep Red when they made G/S. It was a completely new trainer who looked completely different and had a completely different name. Completely different from taking an icon of a character who's been established over 30 years and 17 games and changing him.

And yeah, I suppose you can't exactly argue against ""options,"" but don't act like it won't change the game. It will. It will change it from playing a real character in a classic adventure to playing some lifeless self-insert RPG. Should we maybe add an option to make it a shooter or a strategy game as well, to expand the market and appease the people who don't like action adventure. This sort of stuff is just stupid, really. 

And why does Zelda need to be a ""progressive"" series? What the hell is so great about being ""progressive"" that 30 years of established artistic vision should be thrown out the window?"
1683848798,102.0.0.100,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource18.html,"No, he hasn't. He's been his own character a good number of times. It wasn't the player whose sister was kindapped, it was Link. It wasn't the player who was angry at that, it was Link. It wasn't the player who ran off a cliff trying to save her, it was Link. If you make Link a blank slate, a carboard cutout, you *will* notice a significant drop in quality of the game, because no one can talk with him jovially about something which is personal to him. No one can call him son, or brother. No young girls could swoon at his celebrity, and plenty of people would just be confused with ""why is Link a girl now?""

And I'd hardly say it's a false equivalence seeming as you can make the exact same argument for it. Just because you don't like it doesn't make it a false equivilence. Actually tell me why I shouldn't have the option to play it as a strategy game, or the option to play it as a top-down game. Maybe I like that better. Maybe that would help me be better immersed in the game and it would increase the player base or whatever. After all, we obviously can't just make a new thing. No, we have to change what is already established, because change is in and of itself a good thing.

And you know what, I would be upset if this game gets rid of the tried and true green tunic. Because there's no good reason to do it. It'd be stupid, like changing an established character's gender and then just shrugging it off like it's a hair style. People don't have an identity crisis over hair styles. So stop trying act like Link's gender is some ""minor thing."" It's not, it's quite a major thing and will have to inherently change the game in order for anything to feel natural. Men and women are different, and people treat them differently. Adding the option to change Link to a woman wouldn't make the game better, it would just make the writing worse and damage the reliability of the image of the brand.

And contrary to popular belief, some people think it's a bad and distasteful idea without being some ""mean old sexist"" boogeyman. Maybe, just maybe, people like established characters to stay as they are. They like batman to dress up like a bat, for superman to be arrayed in red, blue, and yellow. They want Link to be a young man in green with a sword. They want Mario to be an overweight Italian plumber with a mustache. They want Sherlock Holmes to be a middle aged English bohemian consulting detective with a drug problem. People want characters to stay consistent, and doing things like changing their traits or their gender or their color scheme will piss off these people."

2. Considering those 11 are 100% of the heroes we know of, and that most of those thousands of years are peaceful, I'd say that yeah, that is a majority. I mean, technically, we could have a million Links be male and you might say ""well, it's not a majority"" because in theory there could be 2 million more in the future. But the fact that 11 times the Hero incarnates almost exactly the same, and that he does so even with thousands of years to change his mind is pretty telling. And maybe you don't care about canon, but many others do and have for a very long time. And so do the creators, it would seem, as they are willing to tie the games to each other. So to throw something out and make a change just because you don't care about its implications when countless others and even the game's creators obviously do, well, that's pretty selfish."

I especially don't care if this change they want to implement then negatively effects the quality of writing in the game because the game has to become super generic and Link can't be referred to directly at all in any sort of personal way other than ""you."" But yeah, keep telling yourself that these people are worth pursuing and that a generic character won't create generic writing and take the series backward 20 years."

Women and men are not the same, they do not react to the same situation in the same way, and people do not have the same relationships with them. The relationship of a brother to his sister is very different from the relationship of a sister to her sister. If you can't recognize that, then I'm sorry, but you're an idiot.

Do you really think that women are just men with a vagina? Because that's what you're implying. Now do you realize how ridiculous *your* reasoning (or lack thereof) sounds?"

But, I mean, it's not like you would actually know much on the topic, being the only child that you are. I shouldn't be too upset that you don't recognize the fundamental and subtle differences between how a brother and sister interact compared to how two sisters interact. Even on an individual basis, I think you'd be hard pressed to find any woman who would act exactly like a man like you are suggesting they would. I mean, heck, these people that you are suggesting want Link to be a woman to better relate to him or whatever, I kind of doubt that a set of breasts and a vagina is all that they are looking for. I somehow doubt that if (s)he acted exactly like a man that they would be very impressed or get that ""immersion"" that they are asking for."

How there are no subtleties introduced to personality and behavior due to inherent differences in how the two genders perceive the world. And tell me more about how a brother and sister act the same as two sisters, or how everyone will treat a young girl the same way they would treat a young man. Tell me more about how having a father/son dynamic won't be really awkward to most people when the son is suddenly a daughter (yet nothing about the relationship changes).

Because I'm pretty sure that that's what you had claimed earlier.

Also, since you are claiming to be so completely familiar with women, then are you honestly going to say that there are not various subtitles in a woman's personality versus a man's even when they can be described with the same traits?"
1683848816,102.0.0.100,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource18.html,Something that they stated 30 years ago and has since been replaced with the concept of Link being a real character.
1683848820,102.0.0.100,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource18.html,"Actually, he's got the best of both worlds. He's silent, so the player can insert as his dialogue whatever sounds coolest. But he still shows some well defined character traits. They may be fairly generic, yes. But to say that having generic traits makes him not a character is missing the point, I think. There are numerous characters who have such generic traits. No, they haven't necessarily stated that. But I can hardly call him a vessel. Maybe I was glad that his sister got kidnapped. Maybe I wouldn't have rushed ahead off a cliff to chase after her. Maybe I would prefer being Zelda's childhood rival, or being the apprentice of a merchant. Any given Link in the past 20 years has so many defined traits of history and character that to call him a self-insert really kind of misses the point of both established characters and self inserts. Not speaking doesn't automatically make him a vessel for the player, it just means he doesn't have to be beholden to the limitations of the skill of the writers.

And have you ever played a game where gender is ""written around""? Or really just taken a close look at anything? It doesn't work. It's bland as hell or really awkward when you aren't playing as the ""right"" gender. It's more limiting for the writers than it is liberating for the small number of players who can't enjoy the game without being able to make their own character."

And why does Zelda need to be a ""progressive"" series? What the hell is so great about being ""progressive"" that 30 years of established artistic vision should be thrown out the window?"
1683850227,102.0.0.100,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource18.html,"No, he hasn't. He's been his own character a good number of times. It wasn't the player whose sister was kindapped, it was Link. It wasn't the player who was angry at that, it was Link. It wasn't the player who ran off a cliff trying to save her, it was Link. If you make Link a blank slate, a carboard cutout, you *will* notice a significant drop in quality of the game, because no one can talk with him jovially about something which is personal to him. No one can call him son, or brother. No young girls could swoon at his celebrity, and plenty of people would just be confused with ""why is Link a girl now?""

And I'd hardly say it's a false equivalence seeming as you can make the exact same argument for it. Just because you don't like it doesn't make it a false equivilence. Actually tell me why I shouldn't have the option to play it as a strategy game, or the option to play it as a top-down game. Maybe I like that better. Maybe that would help me be better immersed in the game and it would increase the player base or whatever. After all, we obviously can't just make a new thing. No, we have to change what is already established, because change is in and of itself a good thing.

And you know what, I would be upset if this game gets rid of the tried and true green tunic. Because there's no good reason to do it. It'd be stupid, like changing an established character's gender and then just shrugging it off like it's a hair style. People don't have an identity crisis over hair styles. So stop trying act like Link's gender is some ""minor thing."" It's not, it's quite a major thing and will have to inherently change the game in order for anything to feel natural. Men and women are different, and people treat them differently. Adding the option to change Link to a woman wouldn't make the game better, it would just make the writing worse and damage the reliability of the image of the brand.

And contrary to popular belief, some people think it's a bad and distasteful idea without being some ""mean old sexist"" boogeyman. Maybe, just maybe, people like established characters to stay as they are. They like batman to dress up like a bat, for superman to be arrayed in red, blue, and yellow. They want Link to be a young man in green with a sword. They want Mario to be an overweight Italian plumber with a mustache. They want Sherlock Holmes to be a middle aged English bohemian consulting detective with a drug problem. People want characters to stay consistent, and doing things like changing their traits or their gender or their color scheme will piss off these people."
1683850228,102.0.0.100,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource18.html,"1. What do you mean we ""never knew how they were connected?"" We knew exactly how they were connected, you just said it!

2. Considering those 11 are 100% of the heroes we know of, and that most of those thousands of years are peaceful, I'd say that yeah, that is a majority. I mean, technically, we could have a million Links be male and you might say ""well, it's not a majority"" because in theory there could be 2 million more in the future. But the fact that 11 times the Hero incarnates almost exactly the same, and that he does so even with thousands of years to change his mind is pretty telling. And maybe you don't care about canon, but many others do and have for a very long time. And so do the creators, it would seem, as they are willing to tie the games to each other. So to throw something out and make a change just because you don't care about its implications when countless others and even the game's creators obviously do, well, that's pretty selfish."
1683850228,102.0.0.100,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource18.html,"If those players are so fickle that they both can't enjoy a game without a female protagonist and have to change established male protagonists into female protagonists instead of making something new, then I don't care if their enjoyment is being stifled. I especially don't care if this change they want to implement then negatively effects the quality of writing in the game because the game has to become super generic and Link can't be referred to directly at all in any sort of personal way other than ""you."" But yeah, keep telling yourself that these people are worth pursuing and that a generic character won't create generic writing and take the series backward 20 years."
1683850229,102.0.0.100,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource18.html,"Not when that woman has to be flopped for a man at any given point, no. Women and men are not the same, they do not react to the same situation in the same way, and people do not have the same relationships with them. The relationship of a brother to his sister is very different from the relationship of a sister to her sister. If you can't recognize that, then I'm sorry, but you're an idiot.

Do you really think that women are just men with a vagina? Because that's what you're implying. Now do you realize how ridiculous *your* reasoning (or lack thereof) sounds?"
1683850231,102.0.0.100,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource18.html,"I'm not putting them ""in boxes,"" I am acknowledging that they act differently. But, I mean, it's not like you would actually know much on the topic, being the only child that you are. I shouldn't be too upset that you don't recognize the fundamental and subtle differences between how a brother and sister interact compared to how two sisters interact. Even on an individual basis, I think you'd be hard pressed to find any woman who would act exactly like a man like you are suggesting they would. I mean, heck, these people that you are suggesting want Link to be a woman to better relate to him or whatever, I kind of doubt that a set of breasts and a vagina is all that they are looking for. I somehow doubt that if (s)he acted exactly like a man that they would be very impressed or get that ""immersion"" that they are asking for."

I'd be interested to hear about how you think that a woman and man will ever be 100% alike in their personality and behavior. How there are no subtleties introduced to personality and behavior due to inherent differences in how the two genders perceive the world. And tell me more about how a brother and sister act the same as two sisters, or how everyone will treat a young girl the same way they would treat a young man. Tell me more about how having a father/son dynamic won't be really awkward to most people when the son is suddenly a daughter (yet nothing about the relationship changes).

You're not saying that you can take a guy, change him to a girl, and have every single thing about his personality and interactions with other people make complete sense? Because I'm pretty sure that that's what you had claimed earlier.

Also, since you are claiming to be so completely familiar with women, then are you honestly going to say that there are not various subtitles in a woman's personality versus a man's even when they can be described with the same traits?"
1683850246,102.0.0.100,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource18.html,Something that they stated 30 years ago and has since been replaced with the concept of Link being a real character.
1683850250,102.0.0.100,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource18.html,"Actually, he's got the best of both worlds. He's silent, so the player can insert as his dialogue whatever sounds coolest. But he still shows some well defined character traits. They may be fairly generic, yes. But to say that having generic traits makes him not a character is missing the point, I think. There are numerous characters who have such generic traits. No, they haven't necessarily stated that. But I can hardly call him a vessel. Maybe I was glad that his sister got kidnapped. Maybe I wouldn't have rushed ahead off a cliff to chase after her. Maybe I would prefer being Zelda's childhood rival, or being the apprentice of a merchant. Any given Link in the past 20 years has so many defined traits of history and character that to call him a self-insert really kind of misses the point of both established characters and self inserts. Not speaking doesn't automatically make him a vessel for the player, it just means he doesn't have to be beholden to the limitations of the skill of the writers.

And have you ever played a game where gender is ""written around""? Or really just taken a close look at anything? It doesn't work. It's bland as hell or really awkward when you aren't playing as the ""right"" gender. It's more limiting for the writers than it is liberating for the small number of players who can't enjoy the game without being able to make their own character."
1683850252,102.0.0.100,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource18.html,"That's not the only thing that would be odd. Young boys treating her like an older brother, mentors treating her like a son, her sister treating her like a brother, etc. His gender is not as inconsequential as you make it out to be."
