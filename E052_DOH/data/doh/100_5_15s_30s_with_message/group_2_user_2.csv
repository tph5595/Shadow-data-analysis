First thing he says. 

Also, your argument only works for samus because literally every metroid game has the exact same samus. She's the same person. No alternate timelines or reincarnations. 

All of the princess zelda's of the series are direct descendants. Blood descendants. 

Meanwhile, every link is a different person. There is a chance some may be family, but it's uncommon. Skyward sword canon says that the godess picks agents to protect zelda and ensure the legend makes its logical end, and if you don't recall, impa was one of those agents. 

Some links aren't even the same legend. Twilight princess link is another incarnation of the hero of time, while wind waker link is not, he is the hero of the winds. 

There are a million reasons the person in the trailer, or the hero of the game could potentially be female. Anything can happen in the zelda lore and there is MUCH to be explored, if majora's mask wasn't any indication. 

Finally, coming from a guy so you don't make any stupid assumptions, male representation in gaming is far different than female representation. 

Making samus a man would be bad because it would alter one of the VERY FEW prominent female protagonists gaming has, which would be a shame, considering how much damage Other M already did to her. A LARGE MAJORITY of gaming's protags are male, and no more obscure female protags don't count because they don't influence perception and representation as much as prominent ones. I love jade, but beyond good and evil is simply not popular enough to be used as a counter argument. 

Meanwhile, having ""link"" be female for one go would at the best add another good female protagonist to the gaming world, in an extremely popular game series. Male representation would take 0 damage as it already dominates the gaming scene hands down, and the worst that would happen would be some pissed off fans. 

Or I could just take the angry sexist turbonerd side of the argument and decided that decent representation should take a backseat to how ""iconic"" a character is. FALSE EQUIVALENCE HO!"
