Not that I'm saying you're wrong, or anything.  Link *never* was *only* who you are.  He's always been a courageous, righteous, kind person who does the right thing, regardless of the player, and in most modern games (mostly Wind Waker) he certainly has his own personality, though I feel its one that Nintendo feels most people would be able to relate to, to some degree.

They also said they're 'rethinking the conventions', and that perfectly fits in with it.  It also makes more sense, from a business perspective, to let players choose, rather than alienating people who specifically want to play as either a male or female.  You want to play as a female, I personally don't care, and many want to play as boy Link as they always have.  It'd be most appealing to the largest amount of people if you could simply decide for yourself.  Wouldn't you be happier, if instead of being forced to play as a boy again, you could simply choose to be a girl?

&gt;Far and above more interesting than being able to customize your character.

Why?  What difference does it make if Link has male parts, or female parts?  It dictates nothing about the actual character, other than imaginary levels of testosterone.

To me, being female, or gender is general... is entirely irrelevant.  It truly changes nothing, unless they take a sexist approach and make the character stereotypically 'girly' and revolve elements around that.

That's why I think being able to pick your gender is so feasible.  It really doesn't matter whether Link(or whoever) is male or female.  It's purely aesthetic."
