1683848583,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"The game flat out tells you. Which part specifically? Right at the beginning you get turned into a deku scrub and meet the happy mask salesman. The HMS tasks you with getting his mask (Majora's Mask) back for him, and he'll turn you back to normal. Easy.

So Tatl tells you what you should do first: go find the great fairy. Again, pretty easy. Just run around clock town for a bit looking for the great fairy. Maybe ask around.

The game is fairly straight forward. Once you get back to human form, it opens up a lot but has the main goal always right in front of you, as Zelda games typically are.

If you dislike that, I feel like you don't really like Zelda games in general and probably will start disliking them in the future as they return to their roots. The next game's supposed to be even more open than any of the others."

I rushed the swamp area and tried to beat both the general area *and* the dungeon in one go. Bad idea. I learned that each area generally takes *2* cycles. One for exploration and generally unlocking the dungeon, and the second for rushing through that first part again (which you know how to complete) and actually beating the dungeon (or just warping to the dungeon itself)."

IMO the problem wasn't the rails. That was fine. It's that it was just a complete waste of time to have to avoid the demon trains. It wasn't fun, it was just bothersome and annoying.

On top of that there wasn't that many good dungeons, no new imaginative items, the story was meh, etc. Just a whole lot of meh."

I'm just gonna regurgitate your fallacy and agist remarks by saying that older people are more prone to nostalgia and can't make a sensible and fair claim as to which is better, while people that see them at the same time have no nostalgia and memories attached so they can make a better decision as to which is better.

Mostly the train mechanic. It's stale, boring, and just generally awful. The story is pretty lame and almost non-existent.. The dungeons weren't that great, but were easily the best part of the game. It's just overall a bland game.

&gt;It is pretty much PH, worked out better and with set tracks instead of drawing your own path.

Not even close. PH still isn't that great, but it's leagues better than ST. ST felt more like it was a 3rd party game trying to copy what made PH a fun game, and the just failing at it.

The main difference comes down to enjoyment. PH was *fun*. It didn't quite do everything right, but in it's own way, it was a charming game. ST just felt forced and almost as if it was a cash-grab title. It got to the point where I put down the game *for years* before picking it back up and forcing myself to play through it."
1683848585,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,Fair enough. Objectively it's strays quite far from the Zelda norm though. It's the same reason AoL gets a lot of hate.

I did.

&gt;OR take issue with his trivialization of people who like lttp

Your wording is a bit weird here. Are you saying I trivialize lttp fans? If so, that is incorrect, as I personally enjoy LTTP (it's one of my favorites). Or are you saying that I'm taking issue with others trivializing lttp fans? If so, then I'd agree. There's a lot that goes into selecting a favorite. Nostalgia can be part of that selection.

Nothing wrong with having nostalgia, or even picking a favorite on it.

To contribute more to the discussion, LTTP *is* a flawed game. It's not perfect, but it's definitely good.

As for the topic of ""perfect"" games, I hold the opinion that if you are able to get tired/bored of a game after playing it constantly for a long period of time, then the game is not perfect. By that definition, no game has been perfect yet. And when one finally *does* show up, it's going to be procedurally generated.

Regardless, age has nothing to do with a discussion on the quality of games. LTTP is great, and you don't need to be an agist asshole to see/say it.

Some people don't like it though. Just like some people don't like Mario, or GTA, or any other game. People have different tastes and preferences. Personally, I find that the several LTTP sequels show it up. LBW is better in almost every way, LA is one of my favorite games of all time, and the oracles are both amazing as well.

I also find it amusing that someone who can't even get his grammar and spelling correct says ""learn to read"". Even though you have no idea if I've never read the thread, read it several times, or just once."
1683848586,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"I apologize, PH is still a bit hazy for me since I only played through it once when it was released. And it's still not one of my favorites (it's actually towards the bottom of my list).

&gt;PH had even less story then ST,

More =/= better. Portal has one of the best stories I've seen, yet the game is only 2 hours long.

&gt;and less characterization

Customization or characterization? Customization isn't something that appeals to me. Again more =/= better. As for characterization, and I can't say, as I don't remember much of either game. ST IIRC just rehashes PH's characters, and throws in a few new ones.

&gt;I honestly don't see how you can find one ""carming"" and the other ""a moneygrab"" seeing as they are practically the same, just that ST has more work put into it.

As I said, it mostly comes down to details. PH was also released first. PH had a unique control scheme, and generally just felt like yet another Zelda game. It wasn't the greatest, and had quite a bit of flaws, but was a fun little game. It had a lot of inspiration from WW and was pretty cool. The map system was neat, and the sailing (IMO) was better than WW's. I think that the world was too small and that was really my only complaint. Not the best Zelda, but a solid experience nonetheless.

Then comes ST. It obviously is banking on PH's engine. We've seen this before, with the oracles, MM, etc. The train thing seemed weird, but I went with it. The game literally took everything that was good in PH and just bastardized it to the point of the game *feeling* like a money grab. There wasn't any thought put into it, the movement in the over world was limited (rather than free like in PH), they didn't fix any of the control issues, they still had revisiting he same central tower, they added in *even more* gimmicks (stamps anyone?), they completely removed any previous plot development (fully settling into 'new' hyrule), and tried to include zelda while also keeping the same rehashed 'save zelda' plot.

On top of that the train mini game (that you were forced to play every time you moved around) was really tacky, annoying, and generally not fun. PH I actually enjoyed sailing around, unlike in WW. The map drawing was charming. I remember doing *something* like that in ST, but it just felt forced and not really something I remember fondly.

Granted, my opinion will probably change a bit when/if I replay PH, but overall it just felt like ST tried to grab on to PH's innovation to stay afloat, while literally everything that is unique to ST simply sucked.

PH wasn't *that* great, but I appreciate that it tried to do new things and generally did them alright. It has that Zelda core to it. ST lacks it and just feels like a Zelda themed game.

It's kind of like if MM wasn't great. If it didn't have the neat 3 day system, lacked the super in-depth characters, and lacked the generally dark atmosphere, interesting dungeons and bosses, etc. You are left with a short, mediocre 4 dungeons, bland NPCs, and generally a shitty game with rehashed assets and ideas. The original (OOT) would be *okay*, as it had a lot more going for it, and it came out earlier (so it could own the good parts), but the sequel would just feel like a forced money grab.

Perhaps if you played ST first, you'd see it the other way around. They are pretty similar, which is part of why I dislike ST. It feels like a knock-off 3rd party clone of PH that wasn't done right."
1683848587,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"&gt;so much so that the Whip returned in SS and Sand Rod appeared in ALBW.

Amusingly, those were my least favorite items in both of those games.

&gt;I enjoyed all of the dungeons in the game, honestly. They might have taken the easy route on the themes of the dungeons Forest/Fire/Water/Sand/Ice, but that doesn't make them inherently bad. They had good puzzles, interesting mechanics and fun.

I should correct myself (and you) here. ST (and it's dungeons) was *overall* pretty decent. No doubt. It's just compared to the *rest* of the Zelda games, it sucked.

&gt;but it's a Zelda game, and they never really are fantastic plots, are they?

The story/plot/lore is one of the main reasons I play Zelda. In a lot of the games it really shines. Sure, some of the plots suck, but the bigger picture they paint is fascinating. ST throws that all out the window and just starts spewing out crap.

&gt;I've just looked at some of your other comments on the subject of ST, and it appears you just didn't have fun playing it. That's fine, but it also sounds like you didn't want to enjoy it. As if you were playing it out of obligation, that's obviously going to impact how much you enjoy the play through.

Right. At first I approached like any other Zelda. I love the series and typically try to play/beat all of them (I've now played all of them, and beaten all but FSA). So naturally I'd play ST as well. At first it was alright. A bit strange. But it just kind of dragged on. Nothing really kept me going, and it all was just lackluster. I got about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way before I just dropped it. Came back to it a few years later and forced myself to finish. The ending was probably my favorite part TBH. That last boss battle (with the train) was pretty awesome.

But yea, in general if it wasn't a zelda game, I wouldn't have returned and finished it, and it would just sat in my ""mediocre games I'll never play again"" pile. Which really bums me out, since Zelda is my favorite series and I typically *love* all of the games (AoL and PH included). ST just really left a bad taste in my mouth. Like it's a non-zelda game with a Zelda skin or something."
1683848587,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"Not quite. I just don't expect games to keep rehashing the same thing over and over and over again. It's part of the reason I thought the first CoD game was alright, and then the rest completely sucked. And it's the reason I typically don't play many shooter games. What's the point in just buying/playing the same thing over with a new name?

It's more about imaginative design. The first time, it's unique, awesome, and generally a great experience. The second time it just looks like you copied the first time over again. If I wanted that first experience again, I'd go back to it, not buy a new game with a different name.

To summarize, ST simply looks like PH 0.5. A clone that doesn't quite do things as well.

Portal 1 is superior to Portal 2, but at least portal 2 introduces new things, adds a charming story, and generally has lots of things going for it.

To relate to another Zelda game. LA has the same gameplay elements as LTTP. Like, quite literally, since it was intended to be a port. Yet, LA is my favorite zelda game (tied with MM), and LTTP is still up there as well. What happened? LA wasn't relying on it being a LTTP clone. It went out of it's way to do interesting things and do things that other Zelda games didn't do. The characters were unique/interesting, there were plenty of neat items, and the game was really well thought out. LTTP was still great, and I like both of the games.

PH was already mediocre for a Zelda game, and ST just took all of those features and threw them onto an even more mediocre game. It comes out looking like a lousy rehash cash grab. It's not that fun to play, and it's overall just a lazy clone.

I mean, PH isn't winning any awards here either, but at least it kept me interested throughout the experience. ST was relying on gimmicks, and once those gimmicks were done, there was nothing left.

So I guess you can put me as someone who ""hates it when the same game is released more than once but marketed as a completely new game even those it's just the same thing but worse."""
1683848587,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"That comment is a bit interesting, it's not trivialization LTTP fans. It's trivialization those who use nostalgia for a reason to like LTTP and claim it's objectively good.

Nostalgia, almost by definition, is the opposite of objective. Which is why it's hilarious.

Nostalgia, as I mentioned, is a fine reason for liking something. But if you have nostalgia, it's hard to claim that you like it because it's objectively good.

Your agist comments make it seem as if 'old' people naturally can point out better games *objectively*. And he responds with saying that there's a lot of nostalgia at work (there is) and that it doesn't mean it's a better game.

Lots of bad wording there. He never actually trivialized LTTP fans."

1683848588,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"&gt;You keep saying ageist like its a trump card yet fail to recognized that youth are limited due to age for a variety of reasons. Experience and decision making ability cheif among those reasons.

There's a difference between saying ""LTTP is objectively the best Zelda game. I get to say that because I'm older."" and saying ""look, I have 15+ years experience in software engineering, I know how things work out, so take my advice and cut down on some of these features"".

The first is obviously ridiculous and has no basis in anything and is just using age as a trump card. The second is saying that you have experience in the field and know how things tend to go. The second is a valid reason (you have way more experience in dealing with things and knowing how they turn out). While the first is using your age as reason for saying your *opinion* is better. For no reason other than that you are older.

One is being agist and saying ""older people are always right"" while the other is using age as a way of showing that you have experience in all sorts of situations. The younger person still may be correct, but the older person has a lot more to go on.

&gt;Anywho, its not nostalgia that drives my argument it is objective reasoning which I was unable to provide before being lumped into a nostalgia group. But you can have your opinion and ill have mine

I'm not saying your reasons for liking it *are* nostalgia. But ""kids these days"" makes it seem like that as an ""old"" person, you are always correct as to what is good. And generally that means you are running off nostalgia.

It's not like we *can't* play these games. I did, and LTTP is one of my favorites. It's not nostalgia for me (for sure) because I played it only recently. For you, it could possibly be nostalgia. Maybe, maybe not. No way of knowing.

If you hold the opinion ""all new games suck and LTTP is king"" then generally that's received as nostalgia fueling your opinions. Not always, but many times it is. And from the other side of the screen, we can't tell."
1683848589,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"&gt;But those items are still new and imaginative, even if you didn't particularly enjoy them or their reiterations in future games.

Fair. But we really *are* discussing opinions here. Development/code/art wise, the game is spotless, just like every other Nintendo game. The real chunk of the discussion comes from opinions on the actual things in the game, which I personally found lackluster in comparison to the rest.

&gt;This isn't correcting me, this is stating your opinion and saying that you're correcting me. I don't think ""pretty decent"" does justice to the dungeons in Spirit Tracks, because they're better than that.

My opinions generally put things lower than the average joe. ""decent"" to me means ""good"" to other people. It's just the way I am. *most* things I'll say ""suck"". And ST isn't an exception. To give a wonky comparison, ST is much better than, say, the avengers movie. Or to compare against another game, it's much better than any of the halo series.

It still is ""mediocre"" but that's in comparison to a lot of other games which ""suck"". I typically don't like a lot of things in general, so a mediocre score is being fairly nice.

&gt;This obviously doesn't appeal to me as much as it appeals to you, I like the lore/story/whatever of Zelda but it's not the main reason I play. 

Fair enough. It's one of the main reasons I play, but I know a lot of people play for a variety of reasons.

&gt;Spirit Tracks doesn't throw it out the window though, it continues on in the future, after the flood when a new Hyrule is founded.

It throws out a *lot*. You could literally chop it off from the rest of the series and it'd still make sense. As I said, it'd work better as a stand-alone unique title, than a Zelda series title. The fact that it tries to bank off Zelda is part of the reason I dislike it. A lot of it has to do with presentation. It's not a Zelda title, and doesn't stand up with the rest of the Zelda titles. As it's own thing, and taken separately, it's decent.

But when I say ""Zelda"", spirit tracks isn't even close to what comes to mind.

&gt;Forcing yourself to play it isn't going to make it fun. Maybe sometime in the future you could give it a replay, maybe a 3 heart challenge or something.

Perhaps. If I had the ability to change it, I'd take away the Zelda theme, leaving it to it's own unique style/story/characters. I'd introduce fast travel so you don't have to do the train crap (I was abusing the fuck out of those warps). And I'd make it so not every little detail has to be logged on the map. In PH it was used sparingly. In ST it felt like I was constantly forced to deal with the map.

I can't seem myself liking it, but it's fine if people do. It gets a lot of hate, which I agree with. It's just a lackluster title IMO. PH isn't much better, but at least I enjoyed it.

Either way, both titles are towards the bottom of my list. And it's not hard to see why when you compare them to MM, LA, LBW, etc."
1683848590,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"&gt;You flat out said that there were no new/imaginative items, to which I rebutted three examples. I don't even think you feel strongly on that point as you're giving PH a pass but it introduced no new items.

You are asking me to compare a mediocre game with a mediocre game. Neither of which I clearly remember, and both of which I played years ago.

I apologize for having weird answers and a bit wish-washy with my statements. I don't clearly remember either of them. Replaying them, I might find PH sucks just as much. But from what I can remember, it was at least an enjoyable experience. Everything is weighed differently. Both games were kind of a let down, but I remember PH being distinctly better.

&gt;I don't see the point of this part, you're just trying to seem like you're hard to impress because you're not an average joe. Edgy.

No, I'm just saying that when I say mediocre/decent, that may (and generally does) translate to someone else saying good/amazing/etc. The Zelda series in general is an unusual exception where I say things are amazing/awesome/etc. Those don't get thrown around a lot by me, yet I say it about almost every Zelda game.

My point with that statement is that generally I rate things lower than most people. PH and ST are in a weird sort of position where I *do* like them. Just not as much as other Zelda games, and as a whole they are just unrememberable and generally mediocre games. Better than a lot of stuff, but generally something I wouldn't waste my time with.

&gt;You've contradicted yourself multiple times in different comment threads and are being surprisingly ignorant for no apparent reason

Bottom line comes down to enjoyment. Regardless of what I'm actually saying and whether or not I remembered correctly. ST was pretty stale for me as a whole. Objectively, I can see the quality. Subjectively, the game just doesn't do it for me. And that's really the bottom line. It's not a matter of not playing them, because I have. I've played/beaten every Zelda game. I do so because I like them. I don't *hate* ST. It's a decent game. I've said this multiple times. I just don't consider it as good as PH. I don't consider PH as good as LA or MM, but you aren't asking me about why on those.

It's a matter of preference and taste. That's really it. It's like asking me why don't I like country music? It's taste/preference. And that's all there really is to say.

&gt;because of the obvious bias you have against the game.

My ""bias"" comes from playing it and not liking it. I *wanted* to like it. Just like I want to like every Zelda game. It just didn't live up to my usual expectations for a Zelda game. A bias would be hating it without playing it.

Would you like me to say some stuff I *do* like about the game? I can do that as well.

I liked how, despite the crappy over world, the game still featured multiple towns with plenty of things to do in those towns.

I liked the 'real time' system with mail/lottery etc.

I liked that you could plan your train direction ahead of time and that you could see enemies on the map.

I liked the final segment. That's easily the best part of the game. Avoiding the evil trains and doing the screen wrapping stuff. Hard, but it was addicting and fun. The train boss, as well as the traditional final boss were both fun to play.

I liked a lot of the cinematics. Lots of cool stuff going on there.

I liked the spirit zelda control. Parts were a bit wonky when she wouldn't quite do exactly what I inputted, but I liked the idea and the spirit tower definitely had a lot of cool sections in it.

I liked the vast amount of customization, even though I don't really care for it and dislike the way you had to obtain the parts.

I liked keeping an eye out for those little rabbit guys, I disliked that you had to return to the rabbit place every five seconds.

I liked the warp gates, but wished there was a general fast travel system. Going to each warp gate got annoying.

etc.

There's lots of good stuff, and as a whole, the game comes out to ""about average"" for me. Not great, but not bad. Nothing against the game personally. I just don't consider it one of the better Zelda titles. PH isn't one of the better Zelda titles either, but I consider it better than ST. Mainly because of the over world difference. I *loved* the boat travel in PH. Even more than I liked the boat travel in WW. ST's train travel was easily my least favorite part of ST. That's where the main difference lies. The rest is just semantics, details, and that ST copied a lot of PH's innovation. It's the same reason OoT gets credit for Z-targeting, even though MM uses the same engine. MM isn't ""good"" because OoT invented Z-targeting. It doesn't work like that. MM doesn't get *any* credit for the stuff OoT came up with. That's OoT's work. MM is good because of the things it adds *on top* of that.

If you think I have a ""bias"" against ST, and a negative one at that, you should see games that I *actually* have a bias against. If anything, my bias for ST is towards the ""like"" side. Since I actually took the time to play it to the end.

If I had to put a like/hate stamp on it, I'd put like. Not hate. Decent game, just nowhere near 'Zelda' quality."

Right at the beginning you get turned into a deku scrub and meet the happy mask salesman. The HMS tasks you with getting his mask (Majora's Mask) back for him, and he'll turn you back to normal. Easy.

So Tatl tells you what you should do first: go find the great fairy. Again, pretty easy. Just run around clock town for a bit looking for the great fairy. Maybe ask around.

The game is fairly straight forward. Once you get back to human form, it opens up a lot but has the main goal always right in front of you, as Zelda games typically are.

If you dislike that, I feel like you don't really like Zelda games in general and probably will start disliking them in the future as they return to their roots. The next game's supposed to be even more open than any of the others."

Mostly the train mechanic. It's stale, boring, and just generally awful. The story is pretty lame and almost non-existent.. The dungeons weren't that great, but were easily the best part of the game. It's just overall a bland game.

&gt;It is pretty much PH, worked out better and with set tracks instead of drawing your own path.

Not even close. PH still isn't that great, but it's leagues better than ST. ST felt more like it was a 3rd party game trying to copy what made PH a fun game, and the just failing at it.

The main difference comes down to enjoyment. PH was *fun*. It didn't quite do everything right, but in it's own way, it was a charming game. ST just felt forced and almost as if it was a cash-grab title. It got to the point where I put down the game *for years* before picking it back up and forcing myself to play through it."

I did.

&gt;OR take issue with his trivialization of people who like lttp

Your wording is a bit weird here. Are you saying I trivialize lttp fans? If so, that is incorrect, as I personally enjoy LTTP (it's one of my favorites). Or are you saying that I'm taking issue with others trivializing lttp fans? If so, then I'd agree. There's a lot that goes into selecting a favorite. Nostalgia can be part of that selection.

Nothing wrong with having nostalgia, or even picking a favorite on it.

To contribute more to the discussion, LTTP *is* a flawed game. It's not perfect, but it's definitely good.

As for the topic of ""perfect"" games, I hold the opinion that if you are able to get tired/bored of a game after playing it constantly for a long period of time, then the game is not perfect. By that definition, no game has been perfect yet. And when one finally *does* show up, it's going to be procedurally generated.

Regardless, age has nothing to do with a discussion on the quality of games. LTTP is great, and you don't need to be an agist asshole to see/say it.

Some people don't like it though. Just like some people don't like Mario, or GTA, or any other game. People have different tastes and preferences. Personally, I find that the several LTTP sequels show it up. LBW is better in almost every way, LA is one of my favorite games of all time, and the oracles are both amazing as well.

I also find it amusing that someone who can't even get his grammar and spelling correct says ""learn to read"". Even though you have no idea if I've never read the thread, read it several times, or just once."
1683850063,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"I apologize, PH is still a bit hazy for me since I only played through it once when it was released. And it's still not one of my favorites (it's actually towards the bottom of my list).

&gt;PH had even less story then ST,

More =/= better. Portal has one of the best stories I've seen, yet the game is only 2 hours long.

&gt;and less characterization

Customization or characterization? Customization isn't something that appeals to me. Again more =/= better. As for characterization, and I can't say, as I don't remember much of either game. ST IIRC just rehashes PH's characters, and throws in a few new ones.

&gt;I honestly don't see how you can find one ""carming"" and the other ""a moneygrab"" seeing as they are practically the same, just that ST has more work put into it.

As I said, it mostly comes down to details. PH was also released first. PH had a unique control scheme, and generally just felt like yet another Zelda game. It wasn't the greatest, and had quite a bit of flaws, but was a fun little game. It had a lot of inspiration from WW and was pretty cool. The map system was neat, and the sailing (IMO) was better than WW's. I think that the world was too small and that was really my only complaint. Not the best Zelda, but a solid experience nonetheless.

Then comes ST. It obviously is banking on PH's engine. We've seen this before, with the oracles, MM, etc. The train thing seemed weird, but I went with it. The game literally took everything that was good in PH and just bastardized it to the point of the game *feeling* like a money grab. There wasn't any thought put into it, the movement in the over world was limited (rather than free like in PH), they didn't fix any of the control issues, they still had revisiting he same central tower, they added in *even more* gimmicks (stamps anyone?), they completely removed any previous plot development (fully settling into 'new' hyrule), and tried to include zelda while also keeping the same rehashed 'save zelda' plot.

On top of that the train mini game (that you were forced to play every time you moved around) was really tacky, annoying, and generally not fun. PH I actually enjoyed sailing around, unlike in WW. The map drawing was charming. I remember doing *something* like that in ST, but it just felt forced and not really something I remember fondly.

Granted, my opinion will probably change a bit when/if I replay PH, but overall it just felt like ST tried to grab on to PH's innovation to stay afloat, while literally everything that is unique to ST simply sucked.

PH wasn't *that* great, but I appreciate that it tried to do new things and generally did them alright. It has that Zelda core to it. ST lacks it and just feels like a Zelda themed game.

It's kind of like if MM wasn't great. If it didn't have the neat 3 day system, lacked the super in-depth characters, and lacked the generally dark atmosphere, interesting dungeons and bosses, etc. You are left with a short, mediocre 4 dungeons, bland NPCs, and generally a shitty game with rehashed assets and ideas. The original (OOT) would be *okay*, as it had a lot more going for it, and it came out earlier (so it could own the good parts), but the sequel would just feel like a forced money grab.

Perhaps if you played ST first, you'd see it the other way around. They are pretty similar, which is part of why I dislike ST. It feels like a knock-off 3rd party clone of PH that wasn't done right."
1683850063,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"&gt;so much so that the Whip returned in SS and Sand Rod appeared in ALBW.

Amusingly, those were my least favorite items in both of those games.

&gt;I enjoyed all of the dungeons in the game, honestly. They might have taken the easy route on the themes of the dungeons Forest/Fire/Water/Sand/Ice, but that doesn't make them inherently bad. They had good puzzles, interesting mechanics and fun.

I should correct myself (and you) here. ST (and it's dungeons) was *overall* pretty decent. No doubt. It's just compared to the *rest* of the Zelda games, it sucked.

&gt;but it's a Zelda game, and they never really are fantastic plots, are they?

The story/plot/lore is one of the main reasons I play Zelda. In a lot of the games it really shines. Sure, some of the plots suck, but the bigger picture they paint is fascinating. ST throws that all out the window and just starts spewing out crap.

&gt;I've just looked at some of your other comments on the subject of ST, and it appears you just didn't have fun playing it. That's fine, but it also sounds like you didn't want to enjoy it. As if you were playing it out of obligation, that's obviously going to impact how much you enjoy the play through.

Right. At first I approached like any other Zelda. I love the series and typically try to play/beat all of them (I've now played all of them, and beaten all but FSA). So naturally I'd play ST as well. At first it was alright. A bit strange. But it just kind of dragged on. Nothing really kept me going, and it all was just lackluster. I got about 1/2 to 3/4 of the way before I just dropped it. Came back to it a few years later and forced myself to finish. The ending was probably my favorite part TBH. That last boss battle (with the train) was pretty awesome.

But yea, in general if it wasn't a zelda game, I wouldn't have returned and finished it, and it would just sat in my ""mediocre games I'll never play again"" pile. Which really bums me out, since Zelda is my favorite series and I typically *love* all of the games (AoL and PH included). ST just really left a bad taste in my mouth. Like it's a non-zelda game with a Zelda skin or something."
1683850064,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"Not quite. I just don't expect games to keep rehashing the same thing over and over and over again. It's part of the reason I thought the first CoD game was alright, and then the rest completely sucked. And it's the reason I typically don't play many shooter games. What's the point in just buying/playing the same thing over with a new name?

It's more about imaginative design. The first time, it's unique, awesome, and generally a great experience. The second time it just looks like you copied the first time over again. If I wanted that first experience again, I'd go back to it, not buy a new game with a different name.

To summarize, ST simply looks like PH 0.5. A clone that doesn't quite do things as well.

Portal 1 is superior to Portal 2, but at least portal 2 introduces new things, adds a charming story, and generally has lots of things going for it.

To relate to another Zelda game. LA has the same gameplay elements as LTTP. Like, quite literally, since it was intended to be a port. Yet, LA is my favorite zelda game (tied with MM), and LTTP is still up there as well. What happened? LA wasn't relying on it being a LTTP clone. It went out of it's way to do interesting things and do things that other Zelda games didn't do. The characters were unique/interesting, there were plenty of neat items, and the game was really well thought out. LTTP was still great, and I like both of the games.

PH was already mediocre for a Zelda game, and ST just took all of those features and threw them onto an even more mediocre game. It comes out looking like a lousy rehash cash grab. It's not that fun to play, and it's overall just a lazy clone.

I mean, PH isn't winning any awards here either, but at least it kept me interested throughout the experience. ST was relying on gimmicks, and once those gimmicks were done, there was nothing left.

So I guess you can put me as someone who ""hates it when the same game is released more than once but marketed as a completely new game even those it's just the same thing but worse."""
1683850064,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"That comment is a bit interesting, it's not trivialization LTTP fans. It's trivialization those who use nostalgia for a reason to like LTTP and claim it's objectively good.

Nostalgia, almost by definition, is the opposite of objective. Which is why it's hilarious.

Nostalgia, as I mentioned, is a fine reason for liking something. But if you have nostalgia, it's hard to claim that you like it because it's objectively good.

Your agist comments make it seem as if 'old' people naturally can point out better games *objectively*. And he responds with saying that there's a lot of nostalgia at work (there is) and that it doesn't mean it's a better game.

Lots of bad wording there. He never actually trivialized LTTP fans."
1683850064,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"Wow, that actually looks exactly like Zelda 2. Maybe a bit more advanced/better. I'll have to play it sometime."
1683850065,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"&gt;You keep saying ageist like its a trump card yet fail to recognized that youth are limited due to age for a variety of reasons. Experience and decision making ability cheif among those reasons.

There's a difference between saying ""LTTP is objectively the best Zelda game. I get to say that because I'm older."" and saying ""look, I have 15+ years experience in software engineering, I know how things work out, so take my advice and cut down on some of these features"".

The first is obviously ridiculous and has no basis in anything and is just using age as a trump card. The second is saying that you have experience in the field and know how things tend to go. The second is a valid reason (you have way more experience in dealing with things and knowing how they turn out). While the first is using your age as reason for saying your *opinion* is better. For no reason other than that you are older.

One is being agist and saying ""older people are always right"" while the other is using age as a way of showing that you have experience in all sorts of situations. The younger person still may be correct, but the older person has a lot more to go on.

&gt;Anywho, its not nostalgia that drives my argument it is objective reasoning which I was unable to provide before being lumped into a nostalgia group. But you can have your opinion and ill have mine

I'm not saying your reasons for liking it *are* nostalgia. But ""kids these days"" makes it seem like that as an ""old"" person, you are always correct as to what is good. And generally that means you are running off nostalgia.

It's not like we *can't* play these games. I did, and LTTP is one of my favorites. It's not nostalgia for me (for sure) because I played it only recently. For you, it could possibly be nostalgia. Maybe, maybe not. No way of knowing.

If you hold the opinion ""all new games suck and LTTP is king"" then generally that's received as nostalgia fueling your opinions. Not always, but many times it is. And from the other side of the screen, we can't tell."
1683850065,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"&gt;But those items are still new and imaginative, even if you didn't particularly enjoy them or their reiterations in future games.

Fair. But we really *are* discussing opinions here. Development/code/art wise, the game is spotless, just like every other Nintendo game. The real chunk of the discussion comes from opinions on the actual things in the game, which I personally found lackluster in comparison to the rest.

&gt;This isn't correcting me, this is stating your opinion and saying that you're correcting me. I don't think ""pretty decent"" does justice to the dungeons in Spirit Tracks, because they're better than that.

My opinions generally put things lower than the average joe. ""decent"" to me means ""good"" to other people. It's just the way I am. *most* things I'll say ""suck"". And ST isn't an exception. To give a wonky comparison, ST is much better than, say, the avengers movie. Or to compare against another game, it's much better than any of the halo series.

It still is ""mediocre"" but that's in comparison to a lot of other games which ""suck"". I typically don't like a lot of things in general, so a mediocre score is being fairly nice.

&gt;This obviously doesn't appeal to me as much as it appeals to you, I like the lore/story/whatever of Zelda but it's not the main reason I play. 

Fair enough. It's one of the main reasons I play, but I know a lot of people play for a variety of reasons.

&gt;Spirit Tracks doesn't throw it out the window though, it continues on in the future, after the flood when a new Hyrule is founded.

It throws out a *lot*. You could literally chop it off from the rest of the series and it'd still make sense. As I said, it'd work better as a stand-alone unique title, than a Zelda series title. The fact that it tries to bank off Zelda is part of the reason I dislike it. A lot of it has to do with presentation. It's not a Zelda title, and doesn't stand up with the rest of the Zelda titles. As it's own thing, and taken separately, it's decent.

But when I say ""Zelda"", spirit tracks isn't even close to what comes to mind.

&gt;Forcing yourself to play it isn't going to make it fun. Maybe sometime in the future you could give it a replay, maybe a 3 heart challenge or something.

Perhaps. If I had the ability to change it, I'd take away the Zelda theme, leaving it to it's own unique style/story/characters. I'd introduce fast travel so you don't have to do the train crap (I was abusing the fuck out of those warps). And I'd make it so not every little detail has to be logged on the map. In PH it was used sparingly. In ST it felt like I was constantly forced to deal with the map.

I can't seem myself liking it, but it's fine if people do. It gets a lot of hate, which I agree with. It's just a lackluster title IMO. PH isn't much better, but at least I enjoyed it.

Either way, both titles are towards the bottom of my list. And it's not hard to see why when you compare them to MM, LA, LBW, etc."
1683850067,102.0.0.51,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource8.html,"&gt;You flat out said that there were no new/imaginative items, to which I rebutted three examples. I don't even think you feel strongly on that point as you're giving PH a pass but it introduced no new items.

You are asking me to compare a mediocre game with a mediocre game. Neither of which I clearly remember, and both of which I played years ago.

I apologize for having weird answers and a bit wish-washy with my statements. I don't clearly remember either of them. Replaying them, I might find PH sucks just as much. But from what I can remember, it was at least an enjoyable experience. Everything is weighed differently. Both games were kind of a let down, but I remember PH being distinctly better.

&gt;I don't see the point of this part, you're just trying to seem like you're hard to impress because you're not an average joe. Edgy.

No, I'm just saying that when I say mediocre/decent, that may (and generally does) translate to someone else saying good/amazing/etc. The Zelda series in general is an unusual exception where I say things are amazing/awesome/etc. Those don't get thrown around a lot by me, yet I say it about almost every Zelda game.

My point with that statement is that generally I rate things lower than most people. PH and ST are in a weird sort of position where I *do* like them. Just not as much as other Zelda games, and as a whole they are just unrememberable and generally mediocre games. Better than a lot of stuff, but generally something I wouldn't waste my time with.

&gt;You've contradicted yourself multiple times in different comment threads and are being surprisingly ignorant for no apparent reason

Bottom line comes down to enjoyment. Regardless of what I'm actually saying and whether or not I remembered correctly. ST was pretty stale for me as a whole. Objectively, I can see the quality. Subjectively, the game just doesn't do it for me. And that's really the bottom line. It's not a matter of not playing them, because I have. I've played/beaten every Zelda game. I do so because I like them. I don't *hate* ST. It's a decent game. I've said this multiple times. I just don't consider it as good as PH. I don't consider PH as good as LA or MM, but you aren't asking me about why on those.

It's a matter of preference and taste. That's really it. It's like asking me why don't I like country music? It's taste/preference. And that's all there really is to say.

&gt;because of the obvious bias you have against the game.

My ""bias"" comes from playing it and not liking it. I *wanted* to like it. Just like I want to like every Zelda game. It just didn't live up to my usual expectations for a Zelda game. A bias would be hating it without playing it.

Would you like me to say some stuff I *do* like about the game? I can do that as well.

I liked how, despite the crappy over world, the game still featured multiple towns with plenty of things to do in those towns.

I liked the 'real time' system with mail/lottery etc.

I liked that you could plan your train direction ahead of time and that you could see enemies on the map.

I liked the final segment. That's easily the best part of the game. Avoiding the evil trains and doing the screen wrapping stuff. Hard, but it was addicting and fun. The train boss, as well as the traditional final boss were both fun to play.

I liked a lot of the cinematics. Lots of cool stuff going on there.

I liked the spirit zelda control. Parts were a bit wonky when she wouldn't quite do exactly what I inputted, but I liked the idea and the spirit tower definitely had a lot of cool sections in it.

I liked the vast amount of customization, even though I don't really care for it and dislike the way you had to obtain the parts.

I liked keeping an eye out for those little rabbit guys, I disliked that you had to return to the rabbit place every five seconds.

I liked the warp gates, but wished there was a general fast travel system. Going to each warp gate got annoying.

etc.

There's lots of good stuff, and as a whole, the game comes out to ""about average"" for me. Not great, but not bad. Nothing against the game personally. I just don't consider it one of the better Zelda titles. PH isn't one of the better Zelda titles either, but I consider it better than ST. Mainly because of the over world difference. I *loved* the boat travel in PH. Even more than I liked the boat travel in WW. ST's train travel was easily my least favorite part of ST. That's where the main difference lies. The rest is just semantics, details, and that ST copied a lot of PH's innovation. It's the same reason OoT gets credit for Z-targeting, even though MM uses the same engine. MM isn't ""good"" because OoT invented Z-targeting. It doesn't work like that. MM doesn't get *any* credit for the stuff OoT came up with. That's OoT's work. MM is good because of the things it adds *on top* of that.

If you think I have a ""bias"" against ST, and a negative one at that, you should see games that I *actually* have a bias against. If anything, my bias for ST is towards the ""like"" side. Since I actually took the time to play it to the end.

If I had to put a like/hate stamp on it, I'd put like. Not hate. Decent game, just nowhere near 'Zelda' quality."
