An honest review these days that isn't loaded with hype is hard to come by. 

There is a portion of mechanical competence that should be taking into review, but then there is the am I having fun? There are certain mechanics that he had issues with, and a lot of people agree with. "

I take one out, I use it over someones face, it breaks, I take the next one out. The difference is I'm fully loaded. This is not like resident evil where I have to worry about my shotgun ammo.

You keep saying its part of a survival games, but you have yet to point out why it adds anything integral? Survival games are generally resource intensive so you really do have to consider what you're going to use. And the arrows and wands are highly good for that, but a pile of clubs/swords/spears are not, they vary a little differently but for the most part none are essential to keep because the game feeds them to you like your hansel and gretel.

You only pointed out theories also, none of which are working in practice. I'm pointing THAT out to you. In practice they constantly interrupt gameplay."
1683848585,102.0.0.11,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"No, you are telling me theory of the gameplay design. I'm telling you that in practice that isn't reinforced strongly in the game.  I don't worry about using high level weapons. Because you won't just have boko shit. In practice the game poorly implements a resource mechanic and its overly intrusive. This happens all the time, developers think of a design but in practice can be proven unfun or clunky. 

Going back to what I said earlier, combat is only a small portion of this game, so having a stock of armaments is generally easier to come by then how often you expend those weapons. Especially later on when you get more durable weapons. You will only get shit weapons if you go back to early areas with shit weapons. First that sort of design discourages any sort of backtracking because you'll only be trading good resources for bad resources, second, the area you're in you'll never have a shortage of weapons for that area. Its unlike other survival sandbox games because there is a level of progression in the world. 

So again, I understand design, maybe you can tell me you're a developer? Just because resource management is a thing in survival games doesn't mean its implemented well. But that's what your suggesting. Any mechanic that is deemed a survival mechanic is instantly good if its in a survival game. One would assume you really don't think too deeply about how the mechanics are integrated in the overall design."
1683848587,102.0.0.11,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Oh man you've brought a lot to the table to explain why its implemented well. Apart from its a survival game and restating the same high level concept... you're completely missing context of the rest of the game, where and when it works well. And relating it to mine craft durability would be like comparing it to dead rising, the original which I adored. All 3 are different games, with different game play, and all 3 have integrated durability in different ways. The fact that you think I blatantly dislike all durability systems because I dislike minecraft as well... you forgot I was saying I liked how it was implemented in dead rising which kicked this conversation off...  I mean if you think minecraft and zelda are the same in implementation/integration, then I think you're understanding of game design is limited.

You can like the mechanic but that doesn't mean it cant be implemented better, less intrusive, more thoughtful ways. Or that there can't be some hideous flaws in the integration."

Also this isn't a survival game, its an adventure game with survival elements. Its your opinion that its a good design. So tell me what is fun about a message popping up in battle constantly about your weapon about to break, or it breaking, and pausing the game to switch to another weapon if there are none on the ground. Tell me why the system works so well that its worth having those constant interruptions in the middle of fights.

Interruptions are objectively bad things, resource management when you have too many resources is a bad thing, it undermines the whole system. Imagine RE where you always had the maximum amount of ammo, and the choices are drop some ammo to pick more ammo up... whats the point?

Its like the difference between Dead Rising, and Dead Rising 4, on the surface level they share many of the same mechanics. But in practice they play entirely differently. DR 1 is a survival horror game with time limits to make it to certain events. DR4 trivializes the entire game because your never without 30 ways to kill all the zombies. Even with identical game mechanics, the way they structure the rest of the game, those mechanics change how those durability effects what your doing. Its also not nearly as intrusive in DR, they just break.

Why does games like DarkSouls which zelda is sort of aiming for have a different and again, less intrusive durability system... 

I'm pretty sure based on what you've said, you clearly don't understand game design or how tweaking a system can wildly change how it works."
1683848620,102.0.0.11,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"First I didn't contradict myself, you are misunderstanding my argument. 

Second, the original dead rising game is closer to how zelda's implementation on durability than mine craft. And it wasn't a straight action game.  And even mine craft has wildly different game play since its a survival/craft game and the type of resources you collect completely change how the durability interacts with the overall design. Zelda is more of an action/adventure game with some survival mechanics. I mean just look at the combat in zelda and tell me the durability has the same effect as in minecraft. You'd be stupid to make that same conclusion.

Please explain how zelda, primarily an action adventure game, would be broken if it let you have a single sword? Because again, its not a ""survival"" game, you can teleport out of any situation, and there are some suvival elements with cooking, and some terrible survival elements with the weapon system. 

Any way this conversation is going nowhere, you clearly don't want to understand game design because it will hurt your precious view of zelda. Unless you can explain to me how constant interruptions during gameplay is ever a good mechanic... bye.

Let me describe a weapon system and you tell me what game its for.
You pick up weapons from the environment,
You have a limited bag space for weapons,
Weapons break after use,
You can throw weapons,
When your weapons break you have to switch to another or find one off the ground."

The genre matters, but you fail to understand where zelda lies. Its not purely a survival game. Where are the hunger/thirst meters, where are the tool crafting, where is the building up of better more effective tools so you can make better use of your time. Those are core mechanics to survival games. Dead Rising / Zelda share more similarities than either to mine craft. They are both action/adventure games with survival elements in a sandbox. 

Yup but I don't know game design...

Just saying it does... I don't know, I don't see it, it hasn't stopped me from playing the way I want to play which is exactly what your saying it is supposed to accomplish. I rush in and kill almost everything with a club. The different weapon types have no effect over the combat style... I don't have any problems apart from playing it that way its become an intrusive mechanic with tedious tasks. "
1683849031,102.0.0.11,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"I didn't contradict myself, the mechanic is intrusive to the play style you says its there to prevent. I don't feel it adds anything to the game, so constantly breaking weapons and picking more up is a waste of time and an annoyance. I've been trying to explain why the mechanic doesn't work the way you says it does. 
"
1683849031,102.0.0.11,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Grading is a poor comparison. You have to get a C or better in school because you're saying that you retained at least 70% of the information. You're comparing a system that requires more than half of the information you learned to be ""learned"" so it starts at 70% to 100% of competence of that information.

1-10 is evenly distrusted from 1 being so bad its just bad and more bad, to 10 where the game is legendary. 5 being... neutral. 7 is good. There is not ""failure"" point, just an opinion for terrible to amazing."
1683849032,102.0.0.11,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Reviews are subjective. Zelda scoring so highly is actually why gaming journalism is so bad these days, there isn't a diverse representation of opinions, and players like you have a misconception that reviews should be purely objective, Also, not saying you but I've seen it before, reviews should conform to a consensus. An honest review these days that isn't loaded with hype is hard to come by. 

There is a portion of mechanical competence that should be taking into review, but then there is the am I having fun? There are certain mechanics that he had issues with, and a lot of people agree with. "
1683849033,102.0.0.11,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"I didn't say that, I said I treat all weapons as transient items. Like a box of shotgun shells. I take one out, I use it over someones face, it breaks, I take the next one out. The difference is I'm fully loaded. This is not like resident evil where I have to worry about my shotgun ammo.

You keep saying its part of a survival games, but you have yet to point out why it adds anything integral? Survival games are generally resource intensive so you really do have to consider what you're going to use. And the arrows and wands are highly good for that, but a pile of clubs/swords/spears are not, they vary a little differently but for the most part none are essential to keep because the game feeds them to you like your hansel and gretel.

You only pointed out theories also, none of which are working in practice. I'm pointing THAT out to you. In practice they constantly interrupt gameplay."

1683849034,102.0.0.11,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"No, you are telling me theory of the gameplay design. I'm telling you that in practice that isn't reinforced strongly in the game.  I don't worry about using high level weapons. Because you won't just have boko shit. In practice the game poorly implements a resource mechanic and its overly intrusive. This happens all the time, developers think of a design but in practice can be proven unfun or clunky. 

Going back to what I said earlier, combat is only a small portion of this game, so having a stock of armaments is generally easier to come by then how often you expend those weapons. Especially later on when you get more durable weapons. You will only get shit weapons if you go back to early areas with shit weapons. First that sort of design discourages any sort of backtracking because you'll only be trading good resources for bad resources, second, the area you're in you'll never have a shortage of weapons for that area. Its unlike other survival sandbox games because there is a level of progression in the world. 

So again, I understand design, maybe you can tell me you're a developer? Just because resource management is a thing in survival games doesn't mean its implemented well. But that's what your suggesting. Any mechanic that is deemed a survival mechanic is instantly good if its in a survival game. One would assume you really don't think too deeply about how the mechanics are integrated in the overall design."
1683849036,102.0.0.11,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Oh man you've brought a lot to the table to explain why its implemented well. Apart from its a survival game and restating the same high level concept... you're completely missing context of the rest of the game, where and when it works well. And relating it to mine craft durability would be like comparing it to dead rising, the original which I adored. All 3 are different games, with different game play, and all 3 have integrated durability in different ways. The fact that you think I blatantly dislike all durability systems because I dislike minecraft as well... you forgot I was saying I liked how it was implemented in dead rising which kicked this conversation off...  I mean if you think minecraft and zelda are the same in implementation/integration, then I think you're understanding of game design is limited.

You can like the mechanic but that doesn't mean it cant be implemented better, less intrusive, more thoughtful ways. Or that there can't be some hideous flaws in the integration."

1683849062,102.0.0.11,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Neither do you... mr game designer. The fact that you have to resort to you don't know means you can't refute any of my points. They are valid criticisms of the system. 

Also this isn't a survival game, its an adventure game with survival elements. Its your opinion that its a good design. So tell me what is fun about a message popping up in battle constantly about your weapon about to break, or it breaking, and pausing the game to switch to another weapon if there are none on the ground. Tell me why the system works so well that its worth having those constant interruptions in the middle of fights.

Interruptions are objectively bad things, resource management when you have too many resources is a bad thing, it undermines the whole system. Imagine RE where you always had the maximum amount of ammo, and the choices are drop some ammo to pick more ammo up... whats the point?

Its like the difference between Dead Rising, and Dead Rising 4, on the surface level they share many of the same mechanics. But in practice they play entirely differently. DR 1 is a survival horror game with time limits to make it to certain events. DR4 trivializes the entire game because your never without 30 ways to kill all the zombies. Even with identical game mechanics, the way they structure the rest of the game, those mechanics change how those durability effects what your doing. Its also not nearly as intrusive in DR, they just break.

Why does games like DarkSouls which zelda is sort of aiming for have a different and again, less intrusive durability system... 

I'm pretty sure based on what you've said, you clearly don't understand game design or how tweaking a system can wildly change how it works."
1683849069,102.0.0.11,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"First I didn't contradict myself, you are misunderstanding my argument. 

Second, the original dead rising game is closer to how zelda's implementation on durability than mine craft. And it wasn't a straight action game.  And even mine craft has wildly different game play since its a survival/craft game and the type of resources you collect completely change how the durability interacts with the overall design. Zelda is more of an action/adventure game with some survival mechanics. I mean just look at the combat in zelda and tell me the durability has the same effect as in minecraft. You'd be stupid to make that same conclusion.

Please explain how zelda, primarily an action adventure game, would be broken if it let you have a single sword? Because again, its not a ""survival"" game, you can teleport out of any situation, and there are some suvival elements with cooking, and some terrible survival elements with the weapon system. 

Any way this conversation is going nowhere, you clearly don't want to understand game design because it will hurt your precious view of zelda. Unless you can explain to me how constant interruptions during gameplay is ever a good mechanic... bye.

"
1683849070,102.0.0.11,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"See, this is the problem I said durability system in dead rising is almost identical to zelda's.. I didn't say zelda is more like dead rising. Your struggling with basic concepts because you're ascribing different meaning to everything.

Let me describe a weapon system and you tell me what game its for.
You pick up weapons from the environment,
You have a limited bag space for weapons,
Weapons break after use,
You can throw weapons,
When your weapons break you have to switch to another or find one off the ground."
1683849075,102.0.0.11,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource0.html,"Yup resorting to grammar mistakes, when you can't argue against criticisms resort to petty issues.

The genre matters, but you fail to understand where zelda lies. Its not purely a survival game. Where are the hunger/thirst meters, where are the tool crafting, where is the building up of better more effective tools so you can make better use of your time. Those are core mechanics to survival games. Dead Rising / Zelda share more similarities than either to mine craft. They are both action/adventure games with survival elements in a sandbox. 

Yup but I don't know game design...
