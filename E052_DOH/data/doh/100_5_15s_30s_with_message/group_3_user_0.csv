That's why there are so many weapons around so you can easily replace ones you've lost. To me it seems like it may be based on amount of hits and higher power weapons are more durable. So if you're fighting a 100 HP enemy with a 10 damage weapon, it'll take 10 hits. Maybe that weapon only can stand 30-40 hits. But a 30 damage weapon would be only 4 hits. Even if it can only take 30-40 hits also, it'd still last longer. I'm not 100% sure how durability works, but that's how it seems to me. May also be based on weapon type.
