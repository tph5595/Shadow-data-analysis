The big differences between these games are that Botw doesn't have a levelling system, and that it offers more freedom.

1 hour link and 50 hour Link are equally strong if they have the same weapon. You can also get the strongest weapons in the game in less then 2 hours if you really want.

Without a durability system, the whole progression system would have to be reworked to be more limited, like Skyrim.

1683848731,102.0.0.94,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource16.html,"That still doesn't solve the problem that durability solves in BotW however.

You can get the best weapons in the game less than 2 hours into the game if you really want to. This will allow you to take on the greatest foes in the game, at any time you want.

If these weapons did not break, you would now be overpowered and lacking a challenge for the rest of the game. Your ""solution"" would mean that you maybe need to collect 5 weapons, but then you would be set. You would never again have to worry about finding weapons, you would be using the same weapons for the rest of the game, and you would be overpowered compared to most of the enemies.

The weapon durability system does a very simple thing. It evens you out against the competition in whatever area you are in. If you are entering an area where you are underpowered, you will soon find weapons that make you competetive. If you enter an area where you are overpowered, you can only slay things with impunity for so long before you have to start using weaker weapons.

This is a brilliant way of making a game where you can go anywhere you want, but still have a challenge.

On your last point, there is no ""money-sink"". As I have mentioned repeatedly here, you will never run out of weapons. If you fight against more difficult enemies, you get better weapons. If you fight against weaker enemies you will get worse weapons. You will never run out.

Weapons also do not break after ""10 swings"". Once you get better weapons they last for several camps of enemies before breaking, at which point you will have multiple options to get new weapons."
1683848732,102.0.0.94,101.0.0.10,evil.dne,/resource16.html,"Again, this doesn't solve the problem that durability solves in this game.
In order to remove durability you would need to add some other form of gating mechanism to how you can get weapons. This would have to be either level and loot scaling ala Skyrim, make some areas too difficult at the start (say, by having a normal leveling system), or make some areas completely inaccessible. 

In my opinion all these are worse solutions. BotW did something really innovative with their world in making the whole world accessible and playable, while at the same time not using silly level scaling such as Skyrim.


May I ask you, why is durability a problem for you? Have you played the game, and what makes you feel it's a bad mechanic?"
